      <p class="paragraf">And the dripping wall is high,</p>

      <p class="paragraf">So it was there he took the air</p>

      <p class="paragraf">Beneath the leaden sky,</p>

      <p class="paragraf">And by each side a Warder walked,</p>

      <p class="paragraf">For fear the man might die.</p>

      <p class="paragbos">Or else he sat with those who watched</p>

      <p class="paragraf">His anguish night and day;</p>

      <p class="paragraf">Who watched him when he rose to weep,</p>

      <p class="paragraf">And when he crouched to pray;</p>

      <p class="paragraf">Who watched him lest himself should rob</p>

      <p class="paragraf">Their scaffold of its prey.</p>
