      <p class="paragraf">At last the dead man walked no more</p>

      <p class="paragraf">Amongst the Trial Men,</p>

      <p class="paragraf">And I knew that he was standing up</p>

      <p class="paragraf">In the black dock’s dreadful pen,</p>

      <p class="paragraf">And that never would I see his face</p>

      <p class="paragraf">In God’s sweet world again.</p>

      <p class="paragbos">Like two doomed ships that pass in storm</p>

      <p class="paragraf">We had crossed each other’s way:</p>

      <p class="paragraf">But we made no sign, we said no word,</p>

      <p class="paragraf">We had no word to say;</p>

      <p class="paragraf">For we did not meet in the holy night,</p>

      <p class="paragraf">But in the shameful day.</p>
