      <p class="paragraf">At peace, or will be soon:</p>

      <p class="paragraf">There is no thing to make him mad,</p>

      <p class="paragraf">Nor does Terror walk at noon,</p>

      <p class="paragraf">For the lampless Earth in which he lies</p>

      <p class="paragraf">Has neither Sun nor Moon.</p>

      <p class="paragbos">They hanged him as a beast is hanged:</p>

      <p class="paragraf">They did not even toll</p>

      <p class="paragraf">A requiem that might have brought</p>

      <p class="paragraf">Rest to his startled soul,</p>

      <p class="paragraf">But hurriedly they took him out,</p>

      <p class="paragraf">And hid him in a hole.</p>
