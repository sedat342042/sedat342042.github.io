  <h2><b>PART THE SEVENTH</b></h2>

  <p class="yan">The Hermit of the Wood,</p>

  <p>This Hermit good lives in that wood</p>

  <p>Which slopes down to the sea.</p>

  <p>How loudly his sweet voice he rears!</p>

  <p>He loves to talk with marineres</p>

  <p>That come from a far countree.</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>He kneels at morn and noon and eve -</p>

  <p>He hath a cushion plump:</p>

  <p>It is the moss that wholly hides</p>

  <p>The rotted old oak-stump.</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>The skiff-boat neared: I heard them talk,</p>

  <p>‘Why this is strange, I trow!</p>

  <p>Where are those lights so many and fair,</p>

  <p>That signal made but now?’</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>‘Strange, by my faith!’ the Hermit said -</p>

  <p class="yan">Approacheth the ship with wonder.</p>

  <p>‘And they answered not our cheer!</p>

  <p>The planks looked warped! and see those sails,</p>

  <p>How thin they are and sere!</p>

  <p>I never saw aught like to them,</p>

  <p>Unless perchance it were</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>Brown skeletons of leaves that lag</p>

  <p>My forest-brook along;</p>

  <p>When the ivy-tod is heavy with snow,</p>

  <p>And the owlet whoops to the wolf below,</p>

  <p>That eats the she-wolf’s young.’</p>
