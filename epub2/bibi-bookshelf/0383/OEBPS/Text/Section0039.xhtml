  <p>The many men, so beautiful!<br /></p>

  <p class="yan">He despiseth the creatures of the calm,</p>

  <p>And they all dead did he:</p>

  <p>And a thousand thousand slimy things</p>

  <p>Lived on; and so did I</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>I looked upon the rotting sea,</p>

  <p class="yan">And envieth that they should live, and so many lie dead.</p>

  <p>And drew my eyes away;</p>

  <p>I looked upon the rotting deck,</p>

  <p>And there the dead men lay</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>I looked to Heaven, and tried to pray:</p>

  <p>But or ever a prayer had gusht,</p>

  <p>A wicked whisper came, and made</p>

  <p>My heart as dry as dust.</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>I closed my lids, and kept them close,</p>

  <p>And the balls like pulses beat;</p>

  <p>For the sky and the sea, and the sea and the sky</p>

  <p>Lay like a load on my weary eye,</p>

  <p>And the dead were at my feet.</p>
