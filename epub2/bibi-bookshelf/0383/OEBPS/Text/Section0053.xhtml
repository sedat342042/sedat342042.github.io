  <p>Around, around, flew each sweet sound,</p>

  <p>Then darted to the Sun;</p>

  <p>Slowly the sounds came back again,</p>

  <p>Now mixed, now one by one.</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>Sometimes a-dropping from the sky</p>

  <p>I heard the sky-lark sing;</p>

  <p>Sometimes all little birds that are,</p>

  <p>How they seemed to fill the sea and air</p>

  <p>With their sweet jargoning!</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>And now ‘twas like all instruments,</p>

  <p>Now like a lonely flute;</p>

  <p>And now it is an angel’s song,</p>

  <p>That makes the Heavens be mute.</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>It ceased; yet still the sails made on</p>

  <p>A pleasant noise till noon,</p>

  <p>A noise like of a hidden brook</p>

  <p>In the leafy month of June,</p>

  <p>That to the sleeping woods all night</p>

  <p>Singeth a quiet tune.</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>Till noon we quietly sailed on,</p>

  <p>Yet never a breeze did breathe:</p>

  <p>Slowly and smoothly went the ship,</p>

  <p>Moved onward from beneath.</p>
