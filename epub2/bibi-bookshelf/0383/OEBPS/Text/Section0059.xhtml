  <h2><b>PART THE SIXTH</b></h2>

  <p>FIRST VOICE</p>

  <p>‘But tell me, tell me! speak again,</p>

  <p>Thy soft response renewing -</p>

  <p>What makes that ship drive on so fast?</p>

  <p>What is the ocean doing?’</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>SECOND VOICE</p>

  <p>‘Still as a slave before his lord,</p>

  <p>The ocean hath no blast;</p>

  <p>His great bright eye most silently</p>

  <p>Up to the Moon is cast -</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>If he may know which way to go;</p>

  <p>For she guides him smooth or grim</p>

  <p>See, brother, see! how graciously</p>

  <p>She looketh down on him.’</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p class="yan">The Mariner hath been cast into a trance; for the angelic power causeth the vessel to drive northward faster than human life could endure.</p>

  <p>FIRST VOICE</p>

  <p>‘But why drives on that ship so fast,</p>

  <p>Without or wave or wind?’</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>SECOND VOICE</p>

  <p>‘The air is cut away before,</p>

  <p>And closes from behind.</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>Fly, brother, fly! More high, more high</p>

  <p>Or we shall be belated:</p>

  <p>For slow and slow that ship will go,</p>

  <p>When the Mariner’s trance is abated.’</p>
