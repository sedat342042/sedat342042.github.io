  <p class="yan">TheWedding-Guest is spellbound by the eye of the old seafaring man, and constrained to hear his tale.</p>

  <p>He holds him with his glittering eye -</p>

  <p>The Wedding-Guest stood still,<br /></p>

  <p>And listens like a three years child:</p>

  <p>The Mariner hath his will.</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>The Wedding-Guest sat on a stone:</p>

  <p>He cannot chuse but hear;</p>

  <p>And thus spake on that ancient man,</p>

  <p>The bright-eyed Mariner.</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p class="yan">The Mariner tells how the ship sailed southward with a good wind and fair weather, till it reached the Line.</p>

  <p>“The ship was cheered, the harbour cleared,</p>

  <p>Merrily did we drop</p>

  <p>Below the kirk, below the hill,</p>

  <p>Below the light-house top.</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>The Sun came up upon the left,</p>

  <p>Out of the sea came he!</p>

  <p>And he shone bright, and on the right</p>

  <p>Went down into the sea.</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>Higher and higher every day,</p>

  <p>Till over the mast at noon - ”</p>

  <p>The Wedding-Guest here beat his breast,</p>

  <p>For he heard the loud bassoon.</p>
