  <p class="yan">The ship driven by a storm toward the South Pole.</p>

  <p>“And now the STORM-BLAST came,</p>

  <p>and he Was tyrannous and strong:</p>

  <p>He struck with his o’ertaking wings,</p>

  <p>And chased south along.</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>With sloping masts and dipping prow,</p>

  <p>As who pursued with yell and blow</p>

  <p>Still treads the shadow of his foe</p>

  <p>And forward bends his head,</p>

  <p>The ship drove fast, loud roared the blast,</p>

  <p>And southward aye we fled.</p>
