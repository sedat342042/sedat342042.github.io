  <p class="yan">The land of ice and of fearful sounds where no living thing was to be seen.</p>

  <p>And through the drifts the snowy clifts</p>

  <p>Did send a dismal sheen:</p>

  <p>Nor shapes of men nor beasts we ken -</p>

  <p>The ice was all between.</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>The ice was here, the ice was there,</p>

  <p>The ice was all around:</p>

  <p>It cracked and growled, and roared and howled,</p>

  <p>Like noises in a swound!</p>
