<body style="margin-left:30%">
  <div>
    <p class="yan">No twilight within the courts of the Sun.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The Sun’s rim dips; the stars rush out:</p>

  <p>At one stride comes the dark;</p>

  <p>With far-heard whisper, o’er the sea.</p>

  <p>Off shot the spectre-bark.</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>We listened and looked sideways up!</p>

  <p>Fear at my heart, as at a cup,</p>

  <p>My life-blood seemed to sip!</p>

  <div>
    <p class="yan">At the rising of the Moon,</p>
  </div>

  <p>The stars were dim, and thick the night,</p>

  <p>The steersman’s face by his lamp gleamed white;</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>From the sails the dew did drip -</p>

  <p>Till clombe above the eastern bar</p>

  <p>The horned Moon, with one bright star</p>

  <p>Within the nether tip.</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <p class="yan">One after another,</p>
  </div>

  <p>One after one, by the star-dogged Moon</p>

  <p>Too quick for groan or sigh,</p>

  <p>Each turned his face with a ghastly pang,</p>

  <p>And cursed me with his eye.</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>Four times fifty living men,</p>

  <p>(And I heard nor sigh nor groan)</p>

  <div>
    <p><span style="font-style:italic;">His shipmates drop down dead.</span></p>
  </div>

  <p>With heavy thump, a lifeless lump,</p>

  <p>They dropped down one by one.</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>The souls did from their bodies fly, -</p>

  <p class="yan">But Life-in-Death begins her work on the ancient Mariner.</p>

  <p>They fled to bliss or woe!</p>

  <p>And every soul, it passed me by,</p>

  <p>Like the whizz of my cross-bow!</p>
</body>
