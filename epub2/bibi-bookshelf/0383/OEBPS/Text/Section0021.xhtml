  <h2><b>PART THE SECOND</b></h2>

  <p class="yan">His shipmates cry out against the ancient mariner, for killing the bird of good luck.</p>

  <p>The Sun now rose upon the right:</p>

  <p>Out of the sea came he,</p>

  <p>Still hid in mist, and on the left</p>

  <p>Went down into the sea.</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>And the good south wind still blew behind</p>

  <p>But no sweet bird did follow,</p>

  <p>Nor any day for food or play</p>

  <p>Came to the marinersâ€™ hollo!</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>And I had done an hellish thing,</p>

  <p>And it would work 'em woe:</p>

  <p>For all averred, I had killed the bird</p>

  <p>That made the breeze to blow.</p>

  <p>Ah wretch! said they, the bird to slay</p>

  <p>That made the breeze to blow!</p>
