  <p class="yan">He heareth sounds and seeth strange sights and commotions in the sky and the element.</p>

  <p>And soon I heard a roaring wind:</p>

  <p>It did not come anear;</p>

  <p>But with its sound it shook the sails,</p>

  <p>That were so thin and sere.</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>The upper air burst into life!</p>

  <p>And a hundred fire-flags sheen,</p>

  <p>To and fro they were hurried about!</p>

  <p>And to and fro, and in and out,</p>

  <p>The wan stars danced between.</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>And the coming wind did roar more loud,</p>

  <p>And the sails did sigh like sedge;</p>

  <p>And the rain poured down from one black cloud;</p>

  <p>The Moon was at its edge.</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>The thick black cloud was cleft, and still</p>

  <p>The Moon was at its side:</p>

  <p>Like waters shot from some high crag,</p>

  <p>The lightning fell with never a jag,</p>

  <p>A river steep and wide.</p>
