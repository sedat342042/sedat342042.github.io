    <p class="yan">A Spirit had followed them; one of the invisible inhabitants of this planet, neither departed souls nor angels; concerning whom the learned Jew, Josephus, and the Platonic Constantinopolit an, Michael Psellus, may be consulted. They are very numerous and there is no climate or element without one or more. The shipmates, in their sore distress, would fain throw the whole guilt on the ancient Mariner: in sign whereof they hang the dead sea-bird round his neck</p>
  </div>

  <p>And some in dreams assured were</p>

  <p>Of the spirit that plagued us so:</p>

  <p>Nine fathom deep he had followed us</p>

  <p>From the land of mist and snow.</p>

  <p>And every tongue, through utter drought,</p>

  <p>Was withered at the root;</p>

  <p>We could not speak, no more than if</p>

  <p>We had been choked with soot.</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>Ah! well a-day! what evil looks</p>

  <p>Had I from old and young!</p>

  <p>Instead of the cross, the Albatross</p>

  <p>About my neck was hung.</p>
