  <p class="yan">The lonesome Spirit from the South Pole carries on the ship as far as the Line, in obedience to the angelic troop, but still requireth vengeance.</p>

  <p>Under the keel nine fathom deep,<br /></p>

  <p>From the land of mist and snow,</p>

  <p>The spirit slid: and it was he</p>

  <p>That made the ship to go.</p>

  <p>The sails at noon left off their tune,</p>

  <p>And the ship stood still also.</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>The Sun, right up above the mast,</p>

  <p>Had fixed her to the ocean:</p>

  <p>But in a minute she â€˜gan stir,</p>

  <p>With a short uneasy motion -</p>

  <p>Backwards and forwards half her length</p>

  <p>With a short uneasy motion.</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>Then like a pawing horse let go,</p>

  <p>She made a sudden bound:</p>

  <p>It flung the blood into my head,</p>

  <p>And I fell down in a swound.</p>
