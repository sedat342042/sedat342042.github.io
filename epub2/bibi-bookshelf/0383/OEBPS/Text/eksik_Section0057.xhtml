  <p class="yan">The Polar Spirit’s fellow-demons, the invisible inhabitants of the element, take part in his wrong&nbsp;; and two of them relate, one to the other, that penance long and heavy for the ancient Mariner hath been accorded to the Polar Spirit, who returneth southward.</p>

  <p>How long in that same fit I lay,<br /></p>

  <p>I have not to declare;</p>

  <p>But ere my living life returned,</p>

  <p>I heard and in my soul discerned</p>

  <p>Two voices in the air.</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>‘Is it he?’ quoth one, ‘Is this the man?</p>

  <p>By him who died on cross,</p>

  <p>With his cruel bow he laid full low,</p>

  <p>The harmless Albatross.</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>‘The spirit who bideth by himself</p>

  <p>In the land of mist and snow,</p>

  <p>He loved the bird that loved the man</p>

  <p>Who shot him with his bow.’</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>The other was a softer voice,</p>

  <p>As soft as honey-dew:</p>

  <p>Quoth he, ‘The man hath penance done,</p>

  <p>And penance more will do.’</p>
