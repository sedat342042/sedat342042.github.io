  <p class="yan">The supernatural motion is retarded; the Mariner awakes, and his penance begins anew.</p>

  <p>I woke, and we were sailing on</p>

  <p>As in a gentle weather:</p>

  <p>â€˜Twas night, calm night, the Moon was high;</p>

  <p>The dead men stood together.</p>

  <div>
    <div>
      <br />
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>All stood together on the deck,</p>

  <p>For a charnel-dungeon fitter:</p>

  <p>All fixed on me their stony eyes,</p>

  <p>That in the Moon did glitter.</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>The pang, the curse, with which they died,</p>

  <p>Had never passed away:</p>

  <p>I could not draw my eyes from theirs,</p>

  <p>Nor turn them up to pray.</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p class="yan">The curse is finally expiated.</p>

  <p>And now this spell was snapt: once more</p>

  <p>I viewed the ocean green.</p>

  <p>And looked far forth, yet little saw</p>

  <p>Of what had else been seen -</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>Like one that on a lonesome road</p>

  <p>Doth walk in fear and dread,</p>

  <p>And having once turned round walks on,</p>

  <p>And turns no more his head;</p>

  <p>Because he knows, a frightful fiend</p>

  <p>Doth close behind him tread.</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>But soon there breathed a wind on me,</p>

  <p>Nor sound nor motion made:</p>

  <p>Its path was not upon the sea,</p>

  <p>In ripple or in shade.</p>
