    <p class="yan">But when the Jog cleared off, they justify the same, and thus make themselves accomplices in the crime.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Nor dim nor red, like God’s own head,</p>

  <p>The glorious Sun uprist:</p>

  <p>Then all averred, I had killed the bird</p>

  <p>That brought the fog and mist.</p>

  <p>‘Twas right, said they, such birds to slay,</p>

  <p>That bring the fog and mist.</p>

  <div>

  </div>

  <p class="yan">The fair breeze continues; the ship enters the Pacific Ocean, and sails northward even till it reaches the Line.</p>

  <p>The fair breeze blew, the white foam flew,</p>

  <p>The furrow followed free:</p>

  <p>We were the first that ever burst</p>

  <p>Into that silent sea.</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>Down dropt the breeze, the sails dropt down,</p>

  <p>‘Twas sad as sad could be;</p>

  <p class="yan">The ship hath been suddenly becalmed.</p>

  <p>And we did speak only to break</p>

  <p>The silence of the sea!</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>All in a hot and copper sky,</p>

  <p>The bloody Sun, at noon,</p>

  <p>Right up above the mast did stand,</p>

  <p>No bigger than the Moon.</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>Day after day, day after day,</p>

  <p>We stuck, nor breath nor motion;</p>

  <p>As idle as a painted ship</p>

  <p>Upon a painted ocean.</p>
