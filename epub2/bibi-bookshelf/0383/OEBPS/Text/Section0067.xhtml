  <p>Each corse lay flat, lifeless and flat,<br /></p>

  <p>And, by the holy rood!</p>

  <p>A man all light, a seraph-man,</p>

  <p>On every corse there stood.</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>This seraph band, each waved his hand:</p>

  <p>It was a heavenly sight!</p>

  <p>They stood as signals to the land,</p>

  <p>Each one a lovely light:</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>This seraph-band, each waved his hand,</p>

  <p>No voice did they impart -</p>

  <p>No voice; but oh! the silence sank</p>

  <p>Like music on my heart.</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>But soon I heard the dash of oars;</p>

  <p>I heard the Pilot’s cheer;</p>

  <p>My head was turned perforce away,</p>

  <p>And I saw a boat appear.</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>The Pilot, and the Pilot’s boy,</p>

  <p>I heard them coming fast:</p>

  <p>Dear Lord in Heaven! it was a joy</p>

  <p>The dead men could not blast.</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>I saw a third - I heard his voice:</p>

  <p>It is the Hermit good!</p>

  <p>He singeth loud his godly hymns</p>

  <p>That he makes in the wood.</p>

  <p>He’ll shrieve my soul, he’ll wash away</p>

  <p>The Albatross’s blood.</p>
