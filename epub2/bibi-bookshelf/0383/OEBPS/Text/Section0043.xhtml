  <p class="yan">In his loneliness and fixedness he yearneth towards the journeying Moon, and the stars that still sojourn, yet still move onward; and everywhere the blue sky belongs to them, and is their appointed rest, and their native country and their own natural homes, which they enter unannounced, as lords that are certainly expected and yet there is a silent joy at their arrival.</p>

  <p>The moving Moon went up the sky,</p>

  <p>And no where did abide:</p>

  <p>Softly she was going up,</p>

  <p>And a star or two beside.</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>Her beams bemocked the sultry main,</p>

  <p>Like April hoar-frost spread;</p>

  <p>But where the shipâ€™s huge shadow lay,</p>

  <p>The charmed water burnt alway</p>

  <p>A still and awful red.</p>
