  <p class="yan">At its nearer approach; it seemeth to him to be a ship; and at a dear ransom hefreeth his speech from the bonds of thirst.</p>

  <p>With throats unslaked, with black lips baked,</p>

  <p>We could not laugh nor wail;</p>

  <p>Through utter drought all dumb we stood!</p>

  <p>I bit my arm, I sucked the blood,</p>

  <p>And cried, A sail! a sail!</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>With throats unslaked, with black lips baked,</p>

  <p>Agape they heard me call:</p>

  <p class="yan">A flash of joy;<br /></p>

  <p>Gramercy! they for joy did grin,</p>

  <p>And all at once their breath drew in,</p>

  <p>As they were drinking all.</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p class="yan">And horror follows. For can it be a ship that comes onward without wind or tide?</p>

  <p>See! see! (I cried) she tacks no more!</p>

  <p>Hither to work us weal;</p>

  <p>Without a breeze, without a tide,</p>

  <p>She steadies with upright keel!</p>

  <p>The western wave was all a-flame</p>

  <p>The day was well nigh done!</p>

  <p>Almost upon the western wave</p>

  <p>Rested the broad bright Sun;</p>

  <p>When that strange shape drove suddenly</p>

  <p>Betwixt us and the Sun.</p>
