  <h2><b>PART THE FIFTH</b></h2>

  <p>Oh sleep! it is a gentle thing,</p>

  <p>Beloved from pole to pole!</p>

  <p>To Mary Queen the praise be given!</p>

  <p>She sent the gentle sleep from Heaven,</p>

  <p>That slid into my soul.</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p class="yan">By grace of the holy Mother, the ancient Mariner is refreshed with rain.</p>

  <p>The silly buckets on the deck,</p>

  <p>That had so long remained,</p>

  <p>I dreamt that they were filled with dew;</p>

  <p>And when I awoke, it rained.</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>My lips were wet, my throat was cold,</p>

  <p>My garments all were dank;</p>

  <p>Sure I had drunken in my dreams,</p>

  <p>And still my body drank.</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>I moved, and could not feel my limbs:</p>

  <p>I was so light - almost</p>

  <p>I thought that I had died in sleep,</p>

  <p>And was a blessed ghost.</p>
