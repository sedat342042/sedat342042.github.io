  <p class="yan">But the curse liveth for him in the eye of the dead men.</p>

  <p>The cold sweat melted from their limbs,</p>

  <p>Nor rot nor reek did they:</p>

  <p>The look with which they looked on me</p>

  <p>Had never passed away.</p>

  <div>
    <div>
      <br />
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>An orphan’s curse would drag to Hell</p>

  <p>A spirit from on high;</p>

  <p>But oh! more horrible than that</p>

  <p>Is a curse in a dead man’s eye!</p>

  <p>Seven days, seven nights, I saw that curse,</p>

  <p>And yet I could not die.</p>
