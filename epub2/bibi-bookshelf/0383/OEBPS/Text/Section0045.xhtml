  <p class="yan">By the light of the Moon he beholdeth Godâ€™s creatures of the great calm.</p>

  <p>Beyond the shadow of the ship,</p>

  <p>I watched the water-snakes:</p>

  <p>They moved in tracks of shining white,</p>

  <p>And when they reared, the elfish light</p>

  <p>Fell off in hoary flakes.</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>Within the shadow of the ship</p>

  <p>I watched their rich attire:</p>

  <p>Blue, glossy green, and velvet black,</p>

  <p>They coiled and swam; and every track</p>

  <p>Was a flash of golden fire.</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>O happy living things! no tongue</p>

  <p>Their beauty might declare:</p>

  <div>
    <p class="yan">Their beauty and their happiness. He blesseth them in his heart. The spell begins to break.</p>
  </div>

  <p>A spring of love gushed from my heart,</p>

  <p>And I blessed them unaware:</p>

  <p>Sure my kind saint took pity on me,</p>

  <p>And I blessed them unaware.</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>The self same moment I could pray;</p>

  <p>And from my neck so free</p>

  <p>The Albatross fell off, and sank</p>

  <p>Like lead into the sea.</p>
