  <p>I moved my lips - the Pilot shrieked</p>

  <p>And fell down in a fit;</p>

  <p>The holy Hermit raised his eyes,</p>

  <p>And prayed where he did sit.</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>I took the oars: the Pilot’s boy,</p>

  <p>Who now doth crazy go,</p>

  <p>Laughed loud and long, and all the while</p>

  <p>His eyes went to and fro.</p>

  <p>‘Ha! ha!’ quoth he, ‘full plain I see,</p>

  <p>The Devil knows how to row.’</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>And now, all in my own countree,</p>

  <p>I stood on the firm land!</p>

  <p>The Hermit stepped forth from the boat,</p>

  <p>And scarcely he could stand.</p>
