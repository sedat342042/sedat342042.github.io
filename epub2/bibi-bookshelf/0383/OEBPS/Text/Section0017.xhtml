    <p class="yan">Till a great seabird, called the Albatross, came through the snow-fog, and was received with great joy and hospitality.</p>
  </div>

  <p>At length did cross an Albatross:</p>

  <p>Thorough the fog it came;</p>

  <p>As if it had been a Christian soul,</p>

  <p>We hailed it in God’s name.</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>It ate the food it ne’er had eat,</p>

  <p>And round and round it flew.</p>

  <p>The ice did split with a thunder-fit;</p>

  <p>The helmsman steered us through!</p>

  <p class="yan">And lo! the Albatross proveth a bird of good omen, and followeth the ship as it retumeth northward through the fog and floating ice.</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>And a good south wind sprung up behind;</p>

  <p>The Albatross did follow,</p>

  <p>And every day, for food or play,</p>

  <p>Came to the mariners’ hollo!</p>

  <div>
    <br />
  </div>

  <p>In mist or cloud, on mast or shroud,</p>

  <p>It perched for vespers nine;</p>

  <p>Whiles all the night, through fog-smoke white,</p>

  <p>Glimmered the white Moon-shine.<br /></p>
