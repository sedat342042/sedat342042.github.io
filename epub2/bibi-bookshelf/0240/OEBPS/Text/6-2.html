      <p class="paragraf">Ladies and gents, you are here assembled</p>

      <p class="paragraf">To hear why earth and heaven trembled</p>

      <p class="paragraf">Because of the black and sinister arts</p>

      <p class="paragraf">Of an Irish writer in foreign parts.</p>

      <p class="paragraf">He sent me a book ten years ago:</p>

      <p class="paragraf">I read it a hundred times or so,</p>

      <p class="paragraf">Backwards and forwards, down and up,</p>

      <p class="paragraf">Through both the ends of a telescope.</p>

      <p class="paragraf">I printed it all to the very last word</p>

      <p class="paragraf">But by the mercy of the Lord</p>

      <p class="paragraf">The darkness of my mind was rent</p>

      <p class="paragraf">And I saw the writers foul intent.</p>

      <p class="paragraf">But I owe a duty to Ireland:</p>

      <p class="paragraf">I hold her honour in my hand,</p>

      <p class="paragraf">This lovely land that always sent</p>

      <p class="paragraf">Her writers and artists to banishment</p>

      <p class="paragraf">And in a spirit of Irish fun</p>

      <p class="paragraf">Betrayed her own leaders, one by one.</p>

      <p class="paragraf">’Twas Irish humour, wet and dry,</p>

      <p class="paragraf">Flung quicklime into Parnell’s eye;</p>

      <p class="paragraf">’Tis Irish brains that save from doom</p>

      <p class="paragraf">The leaky barge of the Bishop of Rome</p>

      <p class="paragraf">For everyone knows the Pope can’t belch</p>

      <p class="paragraf">Without the consent of Billy Walsh.</p>

      <p class="paragraf">O Ireland my first and only love</p>

      <p class="paragraf">Where Christ and Caesar are hand and glove!</p>

      <p class="paragraf">O lovely land where the shamrock grows!</p>

      <p class="paragraf">(Allow me, ladies, to blow my nose)</p>

      <p class="paragraf">To show you for strictures I don’t care a button</p>

      <p class="paragraf">I printed the poems of Mountainy Mutton</p>

      <p class="paragraf">And a play he wrote (you’ve read it, I’m sure)</p>

      <p class="Basic-Paragraph para-style-override-13" xml:lang="en-GB"></p>

      <p class="paragraf">Where they talk of bastard, bugger, and whore,</p>

      <p class="paragraf">And a play on the Word and Holy Paul</p>

      <p class="paragraf">And some woman’s legs that I can’t recall,</p>

      <p class="paragraf">Written by Moore, a genuine gent</p>

      <p class="paragraf">That lives on his property’s ten per cent:</p>

      <p class="paragraf">I printed mystical books in dozens:</p>

      <p class="paragraf">I printed the table-book of Cousins</p>

      <p class="paragraf">Though (asking your pardon) as for the verse</p>

      <p class="paragraf">’Twould give you a heartburn on your arse:</p>

      <p class="paragraf">I printed folklore from North and South</p>

      <p class="paragraf">By Gregory of the Golden Mouth:</p>

      <p class="paragraf">I printed poets, sad, silly and solemn:</p>

      <p class="paragraf">I printed Patrick What-do-you-Colm</p>

      <p class="paragraf">I printed the great John Milicent Synge</p>

      <p class="paragraf">Who soars above on an angel’s wing</p>

      <p class="paragraf">In the playboy shift that he pinched as swag</p>

      <p class="paragraf">From Maunsel’s manager’s travelling-bag.</p>

      <p class="paragraf">But I draw the line at that bloody fellow</p>

      <p class="paragraf">That was over here dressed in Austrian yellow,</p>

      <p class="paragraf">Spouting Italian by the hour</p>

      <p class="paragraf">To Leary O’Curtis and John Wyse Power</p>

      <p class="paragraf">And writing of Dublin, dirty and dear,</p>

      <p class="paragraf">In a manner no blackamoor printer could bear.</p>

      <p class="paragraf">Shite and onions! Do you think I’ll print</p>

      <p class="paragraf">The name of the Wellington Monument,</p>

      <p class="paragraf">Sydney Parade and Sandymount tram,</p>

      <p class="paragraf">Downes’s cakeshop and Williams’s jam?</p>

      <p class="paragraf">I’m damned if I do — I’m damned to blazes!</p>

      <p class="paragraf">Talk about Irish Names of Places!</p>

      <p class="paragraf">It’s a wonder to me, upon my soul,</p>

      <p class="paragraf">He forgot to mention Curly’s Hole.</p>

      <p class="paragraf">No, ladies, my press shall have no share in</p>

      <p class="paragraf">So gross a libel on Stepmother Erin.</p>

      <p class="paragraf">I pity the poor — that’s why I took</p>

      <p class="paragraf">A red-headed Scotchman to keep my book.</p>

      <p class="paragraf">Poor sister Scotland! Her doom is fell;</p>

      <p class="paragraf">She cannot find any more Stuarts to sell.</p>

      <p class="paragraf">My conscience is fine as Chinese silk:</p>

      <p class="paragraf">My heart is as soft as buttermilk.</p>

      <p class="paragraf">Colm can tell you I made a rebate</p>

      <p class="paragraf">Of one hundred pounds on the estimate</p>

      <p class="paragraf">I gave him for his Irish Review.</p>

      <p class="paragraf">I love my country — by herrings I do!</p>

      <p class="paragraf">I wish you could see what tears I weep</p>

      <p class="paragraf">When I think of the emigrant train and ship.</p>

      <p class="paragraf">That’s why I publish far and wide</p>

      <p class="paragraf">My quite illegible railway guide.</p>

      <p class="paragraf">In the porch of my printing institute</p>

      <p class="paragraf">The poor and deserving prostitute</p>

      <p class="paragraf">Plays every night at catch-as-catch-can</p>

      <p class="paragraf">With her tight-breeched British artilleryman</p>

      <p class="paragraf">And the foreigner learns the gift of the gab</p>

      <p class="paragraf">From the drunken draggletail Dublin drab.</p>

      <p class="paragraf">Who was it said: Resist not evil?</p>

      <p class="paragraf">I’ll burn that book, so help me devil.</p>

      <p class="paragraf">I’ll sing a psalm as I watch it burn</p>

      <p class="paragraf">And the ashes I’ll keep in a one-handled urn.</p>

      <p class="paragraf">I’ll penance do with farts and groans</p>

      <p class="paragraf">Kneeling upon my marrowbones.</p>

      <p class="paragraf">This very next Lent I will unbare</p>

      <p class="paragraf">My penitent buttocks to the air</p>

      <p class="paragraf">And sobbing beside my printing press</p>

      <p class="paragraf">My awful sin I will confess.</p>

      <p class="paragraf">My Irish foreman from Bannockburn</p>

      <p class="paragraf">Shall dip his right hand in the urn</p>

      <p class="paragraf">And sign crisscross with reverent thumb</p>

      <p class="paragraf">Memento homo upon my bum.</p>
