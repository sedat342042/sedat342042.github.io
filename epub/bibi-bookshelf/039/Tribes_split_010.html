<div class="calibre">
<p class="calibre33">I’m a huge fan of Cory Doctorow’s. His books are terrific (not to mention the blog). A few years ago, I read <span><span class="italic">Eastern Standard Tribe</span></span>, and the idea of tribes started to stick with me.</p>
<p class="calibre35">Late in 2007, Corey Brown (no relation), the COO of Squidoo.com, a company I founded, started talking to me about tribes as well. He was pushing the idea of making it easy for Squidoo lensmasters to find and coordinate their tribes online.</p>
<p class="calibre35">Years ago, Hugh MacLeod (no relation), the world’s most popular inspirational business cartoonist (who knew you could do that for a living?), drew a cartoon (his most popular one ever) with the caption, “The market for something to believe in is infinite”—as soon as I read it, I knew I wanted to write a book about that idea.</p>
<p class="calibre35">In January 2008, in speaking and writing about the music industry, I first started blogging about tribes. Six weeks later, Kevin Kelly, the founding editor of <span><span class="italic">Wired</span></span>, wrote a post he called True Fans, which I reference here. He captured some critical thoughts about tribes and their power.</p>
<p class="calibre35">Robert Scoble, the unstoppable blogger, has interviewed numerous tribe leaders, giving me all sorts of fodder but without realizing that this is what he’s been doing.</p>
<p class="calibre35">Kudos to Clay Shirky for writing <span><span class="italic">Here Comes Everybody</span></span>, which will quickly bring you up to speed on online tribes.</p>
<p class="calibre35">At the end of February 2008, I was lucky enough to read Adam Gopnik’s great <span><span class="italic">New Yorker</span></span> piece about the long-lived worldwide tribe of magicians. Jamy Ian Swiss embodies, in some ways, the leadership I’m talking about.</p>
<p class="calibre35">And then, a few weeks later, in March, as I finished writing this book, my editor pointed out <span><span class="italic">Tribal Leadership</span></span>, by Dave Logan, John King, and Halee Fischer-Wright. It has a terrific title. I just went out and bought a copy, and while it has very little overlap with this book, I recommend that you read it if you get a chance.</p>
<p class="calibre35">I’ve had the privilege of working with the self-managing tribe of 250,000 people at Squidoo, led by Megan, Corey, Gil, Anne, Kimberly, Anne, and Blake. Thanks, guys, for showing me how it works.</p>
<p class="calibre35">There are heroes in my life, people who teach me, through their actions, not words. Jacqueline Novogratz goes to work every day and changes the world for the better. She leads a tribe that is better for her input and enthusiasm and love. She sets an example of what leadership really is. I aspire to be just a little bit like her. And my dad, Bill Godin, tirelessly works to enrich his community with the powerful work he contributes every day. He sends a message to me (and to the rest of us) through his work.</p>
<p class="calibre35">I’d also like to thank the entire skiing Heyman clan for their patience and inspiration, Megan Casey for pushing me to be remarkable, and Lisa, Will, Adrian, Mark, Courtney, and Allison for keeping their promises. Lynn Gordon, of course. Lisa Gansky too. And thanks to Catherine E. Oliver for not missing a thing.</p>
<p class="calibre35">As always, this one is for Helene. I’m glad I’m in her tribe.</p>
