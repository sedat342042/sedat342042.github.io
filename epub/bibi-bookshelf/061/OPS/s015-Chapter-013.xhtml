         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p609"><span class="dropcap-rw">D</span>o you want me to follow you over to the jail?” Mik asked.</p>
         <p id="p610">Louise had been hungry in the car, but now her stomach was doing somersaults at the thought of meeting René Gamst. She hadn’t seen him since his arrest. “No thanks, I’m fine. Just so they know I’m coming.”</p>
         <p id="p611">She let him hug her, but she couldn’t tell whether it felt nice or not. She felt safe with Mik. Once he had wanted to take care of her, and even though everything else between them had disappeared, that seemed to still be there.</p>
         <p id="p612">“Why won’t you let me grill him about the boy’s relationship to his parents?” he asked, his voice serious. “You’re so hard on yourself when you don’t need to be. You don’t have to be the one who goes in there.”</p>
         <p id="p613">“It’s my case,” she said. “I do my own interrogations.”</p>
         <p id="p614">She looked away; she hadn’t needed to say it that way. “Thanks, Mik. It’s sweet of you. But I’ll be okay.”</p>
         <p id="p615">“I’ll be waiting in my office,” he said. He waved his phone in the air. “Just call.”</p>
         <p id="p616">“You really don’t need to wait.”</p>
         <p id="p617">She knew that he’d begun dating a nurse named Lone. Jonas had told her; Mik and her foster son were still close. Mik had given him the deaf Labrador, much to Louise’s dismay, and he and Jonas talked together at least once a week under the guise of Mik wanting to hear about Dina. But from what Louise could hear, the conversations were just as much about Jonas and how he was doing. And now that Louise accepted the fact that Mik had dropped her because of her indifference, she was enormously grateful for his contact with her boy. Jonas didn’t have anybody besides her and Melvin to talk to about homework, music, and girls.</p>
         <p id="p618">She took Mik’s hand and gave it a squeeze before heading for the jail.</p>

         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p620">Holbæk Jail had twenty-three cells. René Gamst was awaiting his sentence, but no one knew when it would be handed down. Only then would he be transferred to a prison.</p>
         <p id="p621">Louise felt self-conscious, as if she were a caricature, when she straightened up before walking in to show her ID. It was seven thirty. A TV blared somewhere, but no one was around. She knew she had to steel herself, otherwise she would be far too vulnerable when René entered the interrogation room.</p>
         <p id="p622">“Sign here first,” the guard said when she began walking past the visitation rooms. Beds, chairs, and condoms.</p>
         <p id="p623">“Of course,” she said, and turned to sign her name and time of arrival. “Is he in there?” She nodded toward a room at the end of the hall.</p>
         <p id="p624">“No, I’ll get him,” the young guard said. “But it’s open; you can go on in.”</p>
         <p id="p625">He ducked through a doorway at the back of the office, and Louise walked to the interrogation room and closed the door. A table and two chairs. That was it. White light blazed from the long fluorescent in the ceiling; the window was hidden behind venetian blinds.</p>
         <p id="p626">The lighting reminded her of the barn at the gamekeeper’s. She couldn’t stop it—suddenly she was back at the assault. She felt the rough hands on her naked body, the pain from broken ribs. And when she pulled the chair out from the table, she heard the heavy breathing that had wheezed like bellows on her neck. That was when René Gamst had entered the barn. At first he was nothing more than a silhouette approaching, but then she recognized him as he stood a few meters behind them, holding a shotgun.</p>
         <p id="p627">Relief streamed through her when she made eye contact with him, but then he glared at her exposed genitals. She saw the bulge in his pants. He could have stopped it right there, but he’d waited, which had made her humiliation complete.</p>
         <p id="p628">Louise closed her eyes and composed herself when she heard footsteps in the hallway outside. She blinked rapidly to erase the image of René’s eyes on her naked body. She straightened up in her chair and rested her arms on the table, while finding an expression to mask the chaos inside her.</p>
         <div class="decoration-rw" id="decoration7">
            <p class="center-rw" id="p629">*  *  *</p>
         </div>
         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p630">René Gamst was astonished to see her. Then his face relaxed, and he stared at her without a word.</p>
         <p id="p631">Louise wanted so much to stare back, but she couldn’t. She concentrated on her folded hands resting on the table as fear slammed into her gut. The fear of not being able to go through with this; that she would have to leave without talking to him.</p>
         <p id="p632">Gamst sat down on the other side of the table and crossed his arms on his chest. Neither of them spoke. She looked up at him, noticed his confident, superior attitude. Thoughts about the janitor from Såby and Gudrun at the convenience store ran through her head. She gave a start when he broke the silence.</p>
         <p id="p633">“You’re welcome.” His voice was hoarse.</p>
         <p id="p634">Something in his eyes made it clear that he remembered what he’d seen in the barn that night.</p>
         <p id="p635">“For what?” she asked, without thinking.</p>
         <p id="p636">“Aren’t you here to thank me for shooting that bastard?” He looked down at her breasts. “They said my lawyer didn’t need to be here because this wasn’t going to be about my case.”</p>
         <p id="p637">“Excuse me, but do you really expect me to thank you?”</p>
         <p id="p638">He grinned, obviously enjoying this. He tilted his head. “Sure, don’t you think you should?”</p>
         <p id="p639">“You are one of the biggest fucking assholes I’ve ever met. You made sure you got a good look at everything before you shot. And you didn’t shoot to save me.”</p>
         <p id="p640">Rage boiled up inside her; suddenly she felt in control. “You shot him because he’d raped your wife. It was revenge.”</p>
         <p id="p641">He stopped smiling, though he didn’t look particularly ruffled. He shrugged and asked her for a cigarette.</p>
         <p id="p642">Louise shook her head. Had she been interrogating anyone else, she might have had cigarettes and coffee on hand to help get things going. But Gamst wasn’t just another prisoner, and she had no interest in getting friendly with him. She simply wanted a few answers.</p>
         <p id="p643">“What did all of you do to him?” She stared into his brown eyes.</p>
         <p id="p644">“To who? What the hell are you talking about?”</p>
         <p id="p645">“What did you do to Klaus? Back then out at our house?”</p>
         <p id="p646">Gamst’s smile returned. First as an arrogant shadow in his expression, then to his lips. “Aren’t you on the police force? Aren’t you the ones who are supposed to figure these things out?”</p>
         <p id="p647">Her rage felt like armor; there was no way he could humiliate her now. She would make him talk. “What happened out there?”</p>
         <p id="p648">“What happened? What happened! Who said anything happened?”</p>
         <p id="p649">“You did. You’re the one who said that Klaus didn’t put the noose around his neck.”</p>
         <p id="p650">“He was a pussy! He was scared of his own shadow.”</p>
         <p id="p651">She startled him by slapping her palms on the table, leaping to her feet, and leaning over the table. “Goddamn you. Tell me what happened!”</p>
         <p id="p652">“Why should I?” He seemed like he was trying to appear unaffected by her outburst.</p>
         <p id="p653">“All right then. If you’re not going to say anything, I’ll pay a visit to your wife and pump her for every last secret in your miserable, shitty little lives.”</p>
         <p id="p654">His shoulders tensed up at the mention of Bitten. Now she had his attention. He leaned back in his chair but didn’t answer her.</p>
         <p id="p655">Louise paused a moment before changing directions. “How’s the butcher’s relationship with his son? How are they getting along?”</p>
         <p id="p656">“Why the hell are you asking me that?” Finally, he looked a bit flustered.</p>
         <p id="p657">“Because I want to know. Are they having marital problems?”</p>
         <p id="p658">“Not that I know of,” he said.</p>
         <p id="p659">Was he telling the truth? His eyes darted off to the side before he answered. She knew that the rule about linking truth with looking one way and lies with the other was shaky, but he did glance away.</p>
         <p id="p660">“So. There aren’t any problems. Except that the mother is dying, of course,” she added sarcastically.</p>
         <p id="p661">“Why are you asking me about this?” He couldn’t hide his curiosity, even though he tried to sound indifferent, which she also noticed. He clearly didn’t know the boy had disappeared.</p>
         <p id="p662">“You don’t know anything about any other problems?”</p>
         <p id="p663">Quickly he shook his head. He looked confident again.</p>
         <p id="p664">“Fine. I’ll ask Bitten about that, too. I’m sure she’ll tell me if the father and son aren’t getting along. I might need to use some pressure, but then I can mention her affair with Thomsen. She doesn’t like talking about that.”</p>
         <p id="p665">She walked over and rang for the guard.</p>
         <p id="p666">“You better fucking leave my wife alone,” she heard from behind.</p>
         <p id="p667">Louise sensed he was standing up now. She calmly turned around and leaned back against the door.</p>
         <p id="p668">“And if I don’t?” She enjoyed watching Gamst fumble around for words.</p>
         <p id="p669">“Just leave her alone!”</p>
         <p id="p670">“Then start talking! Tell me what happened back then.”</p>
         <p id="p671">He didn’t answer.</p>
         <p id="p672">The door opened behind her. “Tell me what happened,” she said, calm now.</p>
         <p id="p673">When he still didn’t answer her, she turned and walked out.</p>
         <div class="decoration-rw" id="decoration8">
            <p class="center-rw" id="p674">*  *  *</p>
         </div>
         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p675">After the guard closed the door, Louise slammed her fist into the wall. An overwhelming fatigue hit her as she walked away; for a moment she thought she was going to fall. The guard noted the time of the interview’s conclusion and she signed out, angry as well as exhausted.</p>
         <p id="p676">Yet she felt that even though he hadn’t talked, she’d won the first round. It hadn’t been pretty, but she’d emerged victorious.</p>
