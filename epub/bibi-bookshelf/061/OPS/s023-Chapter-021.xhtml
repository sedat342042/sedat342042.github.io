         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1014"><span class="dropcap-rw">L</span>ouise had been awake for a while when her phone rang. She hadn’t had much sleep. She felt ashamed. Eik had been very understanding when, in the middle of all the warmth and fondling, she suddenly had rolled up into a ball and begun crying. Much later, when the tears stopped, she told him the rest of the story. About the sorrow and shame she had been living with her entire life. He stroked her back as she talked about Thomsen and his gang, who’d kept their claws in Klaus even though he wanted out.</p>
         <p id="p1015">At one point in the night, she turned to him and slid her hand over his chest, down over his prominent ribs, his hip bone, his groin, but when she felt him growing and stiffening, images from the gamekeeper’s barn entered her head. She turned away from him.</p>
         <p id="p1016">“Don’t you think you should speak with someone about what happened?” he’d whispered.</p>
         <p id="p1017">Louise had in fact considered making an appointment with a crisis counselor; Jakobsen was his name. Homicide had been using him for several years, and she’d gone to him before. She knew Eik was right, and she decided to contact Jakobsen, but first she was going to find the boy. And also get to the bottom of what happened the night Klaus died.</p>
         <p id="p1018">She reached down to the floor and picked up her buzzing phone.</p>
         <p id="p1019">“There’s an old woman standing here. She’s in our way, and I can’t get hold of Frederik Sachs-Smith,” Nymand said without introduction. “You’re going to have to get her out of here.”</p>
         <p id="p1020">Louise sat up. It was almost seven thirty; she must have gotten some sleep after all. “Where are you?” Eik stirred.</p>
         <p id="p1021">“Out at the graves of the girls. You <i>did</i> find a body out here yesterday evening, presumably a woman, and now we have to fine-comb the entire area. We can’t have this woman hanging around in the middle of it all.”</p>
         <p id="p1022">“What do you know about the body?” Louise asked.</p>
         <p id="p1023">“We don’t know a damn thing as long as this old woman prevents us from doing our job!”</p>
         <p id="p1024">“We’re on our way.”</p>

         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1026">Camilla sat staring out the kitchen window. Her hands held a cup of coffee, while her thoughts were out in the forest with the boy who wouldn’t come home.</p>
         <p id="p1027">Besides everywhere else in her body that hurt, she had a crick in her neck because Frederik had let her sleep on the sofa all night. When he’d come in to say good morning, she quickly gulped all the pills he handed her. He told her about the corpse Eik’s dog had found out by the girls’ graves. She’d been very annoyed that he hadn’t woken her up so she could go along, but he dismissed her by saying that no one had really known what was out there, and anyway, she’d needed sleep.</p>
         <p id="p1028">She turned when she heard Louise’s footsteps on the stairs. She assumed that her friend and Eik had slept together, and she was expecting her to be radiant, but Camilla’s smile disappeared when Louise walked in the room. She looked harried, with dark rings under her eyes.</p>
         <p id="p1029">“What’s going on?” Camilla asked. She groaned when she stood to get another cup. “You could have woken me up. I’d like to have gone out there with you.”</p>
         <p id="p1030">“Can you get hold of your manager?” Louise said. “The police are out there, and they want to inspect the site, but Elinor has planted herself on one of the old graves and refuses to move. The police want someone to take her away.”</p>
         <p id="p1031">“What the hell is she doing out there?” Camilla said. “And what happened yesterday?”</p>
         <p id="p1032">Louise shrugged. “The dogs ran around, and before we knew what they were up to, Charlie had dug down and found a hand.”</p>
         <p id="p1033">“Christ! What is the deal with this place? If I’d known there were hit-and-run drivers, Vikings, ghosts, and double graves, Frederik would have had to move in with me, back in the city.”</p>
         <p id="p1034">“We don’t know if it is a double grave,” Louise said. “We really don’t know very much yet, only that there are bones that shouldn’t be there.”</p>
         <p id="p1035">Eik walked up behind her with a bad case of morning hair, heading for the Nespresso machine. “We have time for a cup?”</p>
         <p id="p1036">“Only if you bring it along,” Louise said. She was halfway to the hall to put on her shoes.</p>
         <p id="p1037">“I’m going with you,” Camilla yelled. She’d called Tønnesen, but he hadn’t answered. “I’ll take care of Elinor.”</p>
         <p id="p1038">She looked out into the yard. Dina lay stretched out under a tree. Charlie trotted around with his nose to the ground, tail wagging. “Should we shut them in, or do you want to take them along?”</p>
         <p id="p1039">“Nymand’s team will have their own dogs out there, so it’s probably best that ours stay here,” Louise said. She looked over at Eik.</p>
         <p id="p1040">“Sure.” He called the two dogs in. “You don’t let an old circus horse smell the sawdust if you’re not going to let him dance.”</p>
