         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1122"><span class="dropcap-rw">H</span>ave you moved your unit out of the station, or what?” Olle asked when Louise met him in the hall Monday morning.</p>
         <p id="p1123">She was about to say that they’d been in during the weekend, but instead she explained that they were assisting Roskilde; that now they had three persons to identify. He asked if it was Nymand’s case, and she nodded.</p>
         <p id="p1124">“Rønholt talked about it at the morning briefing,” Olle said. “He said they found three double graves and to expect that they’d need our help. We might have to contact Interpol and search their database for wanted persons.”</p>
         <p id="p1125">“I wouldn’t doubt it,” Louise said. “Nymand is twisting arms and the pathologists are going to examine all three corpses this morning. As soon as we have the teeth, we’ll start working on identification. There’s more to go on with the most recent corpse; she had two tattoos and we’ve got the photographs. I’ll gather everything up and bring it to the briefing.”</p>
         <p id="p1126">She smiled at her colleague and hurried down the hall to the Rathole.</p>
         <p id="p1127">“I’m guessing you’d rather drink your own tea,” Eik said when he came in five minutes later. He set a tray down on his desk and pushed a plate with two rolls over to her.</p>
         <p id="p1128">Louise was surprised by the mountain of sandwiches on his plate. Two slices of bread with cheese and four liver pâté sandwiches.</p>
         <p id="p1129">“Looks like the fresh country air gave you an appetite,” she said. But when he began scraping off the pickles and aspic from the four sandwiches, she realized what was going on.</p>
         <p id="p1130">“You’re not. You’re not feeding him that!” She looked down at the German shepherd, who was staring up at the source of all that aroma. “He’ll fart all day and drive us out of the room.”</p>
         <p id="p1131">“Take it easy. I’ll go over to Netto later and buy dog food,” Eik promised. He set the plate down on the floor.</p>
         <p id="p1132">Louise sighed. She knew who would have to stop by the vet and pick up some decent food for Charlie. But before she could say anything more, Olle knocked on the door and stuck his head in. He eyed the dog nervously.</p>
         <p id="p1133">“Take a look at these photos.” He held out a folder. “It’s a twenty-four-year-old woman from Tårnby. Her sister reported her missing about three weeks ago. She has a little boy; she disappeared the night before his third birthday. And she has two tattoos.”</p>
         <p id="p1134">It was Station City’s case, and the young woman was a prostitute. Presumably, it hadn’t been given a high priority, Louise thought. Normally the police stalled on a missing person case anyway, as people often turned up by themselves.</p>
         <p id="p1135">“Lisa Maria Nielsen,” she read out loud.</p>
         <p id="p1136">“When exactly did she disappear?” Eik asked. He brushed the crumbs off his T-shirt.</p>
         <p id="p1137">“May thirty-first or June first,” she said. She cocked her head and thought a moment. “The same time as the boy.”</p>
         <p id="p1138">She turned to Olle. “Can I keep this for a while? We need to be sure, of course, but thanks, Olle.”</p>
         <p id="p1139">He left, and Eik asked her to read it out loud.</p>
         <p id="p1140">“Lisa Maria has a young son. He turned three on June first, and he’s the reason her sister reported it at once when she didn’t come home. Lisa would never willingly be gone on her son’s birthday. He meant everything to her. She had invited his friends from the day care for a birthday party, with sandwiches and a birthday cake. Her sister was to have taken care of that. It was difficult for her to explain to her nephew where his mother was.”</p>
         <p id="p1141">“Unfortunately, it happens in that profession,” Eik mumbled. “Who’s taking care of the boy?”</p>
         <p id="p1142">“Her sister. They shared one floor of a house. She has a four-year-old daughter.”</p>
         <p id="p1143">For a moment she studied the photos of Lisa Maria that her sister had given the police. Louise recognized both tattoos. She called Olle.</p>
         <p id="p1144">“Get hold of the sister and make arrangements for an identification. I don’t know how soon Forensics can have the body ready. Try Flemming Larsen. He was on duty this weekend; he was there when the bodies came in.”</p>
         <p id="p1145">She hung up and pushed the folder over to Eik. Then she opened the green folder she’d started on Sune Frandsen and looked it over. “They’ve been missing within the same time period.”</p>
         <p id="p1146">“But we don’t know if they disappeared in the same area,” Eik pointed out. He tossed the last half of his cheese sandwich down on the floor.</p>
         <p id="p1147">“Stop that, you’re going to make him sick,” she said. “It’s true, we don’t know that, but she was buried where he’s hiding.”</p>
         <p id="p1148">“So you’re thinking, he might’ve seen something?” He nodded. “And that could be the reason he’s hiding. He witnessed a crime and doesn’t dare come home. What do you think?”</p>
         <p id="p1149">The pieces were falling into place. “He might have been the one who killed her!” Louise said. Murderer or witness to a murder. Two good reasons to go into hiding.</p>
         <p id="p1150">“It’s a possibility. But he’s fifteen years old. Could he do it?”</p>
         <p id="p1151">“He might’ve seen something that scared him out of his senses; he could have reacted like a wounded animal.”</p>
         <p id="p1152">“Teenagers disappear every day,” he reminded her.</p>
         <p id="p1153">She nodded. Normally the search for teenagers was intensive at first. Police dragged lakes, searched often-used routes, checked debit card usage, and if nothing showed up, later on they would check Freetown Christiania—a haven for quirky and troubled characters, who could find refuge and a place to hide from the authorities—and then youth houses. Often the latter steps would be unnecessary when hunger set in and the comforts of home became too inviting. When the smell of their own bodies became too much.</p>
         <p id="p1154">“The pattern just doesn’t fit here,” she said.</p>
         <p id="p1155">“We have to look into it,” Eik conceded. He asked if it was true that the father said he was going to look for his son, now that they knew approximately where he was hiding.</p>
         <p id="p1156">Louise nodded. “He promised to call if he found him. Anyway, I’m calling Nymand. If the boy can be connected with this killing, it’s his case.”</p>
         <p id="p1157">Louise was put through to the deputy commissioner. She told him that they likely had identified the young woman and added that Sune Frandsen had been hiding in the forest since the day Lisa Maria disappeared.</p>
         <p id="p1158">She summed both cases up for him and gave him the number of the missing person case concerning Sune, so he could see a photo of him.</p>
         <p id="p1159">Nymand decided to instigate a search for the boy in the area. “If he’s there, we’ll find him. But if he has nothing to do with my case, we don’t have time to run around looking for runaway teenagers for you.”</p>
         <p id="p1160">“Of course,” Louise said. Odd, she thought, that his ridiculous remark hadn’t angered her. She must be tired.</p>
         <p id="p1161">“I’ll call the father and let him know that Roskilde is organizing a search,” Eik said.</p>
         <p id="p1162">Louise took a bite of the roll, but the dry bread clogged her throat. She was hungry, though. She unwrapped a block of butter, spread a thick layer onto the bread, and attacked it. By the time Eik had finished talking, she’d cleaned off her plate.</p>
         <p id="p1163">“Tell Nymand to cancel. Sune is back home.”</p>
         <p id="p1164">“And that idiot didn’t even call?” Exhausted or not, Louise was furious.</p>
         <p id="p1165">“He kept apologizing, said it was very emotional when the boy was reunited with his mother. They needed some time alone, and he just forgot about calling. Apparently the boy is already back at school, but that sounds really strange. I mean, he’s been gone three weeks!”</p>
         <p id="p1166">“That’s how it is in a small town,” Louise said. She shrugged sadly. “Everything has to get ‘back to normal’ as soon as possible.”</p>
         <p id="p1167">Eik shook his head. “You’d hope that somebody will look in on the boy, check to see how he’s doing. Is that how it works there, or is it just more convenient to forget about it?”</p>
         <p id="p1168">That last remark sounded like an accusation against Louise. “He’ll be checked on. By us. Before we cancel the search and close the case, we’re driving over to talk to him. I want to know why he hid for three weeks in the forest. And when we’re done, we’ll make sure someone keeps an eye on him.”</p>
         <p id="p1169">“Shouldn’t we do that now?” Eik laid his palms on his desk, as if he was about to stand up.</p>
         <p id="p1170">“You mean, while he’s in school?”</p>
         <p id="p1171">He nodded. “Wouldn’t it be easier for him to tell us why he didn’t want to go home if his parents aren’t around?”</p>
         <p id="p1172">Of course, Louise thought. An adult would have to be present, but they could find a schoolteacher or perhaps an administrator.</p>
         <p id="p1173">“Let’s go,” she said. She was on her feet.</p>
