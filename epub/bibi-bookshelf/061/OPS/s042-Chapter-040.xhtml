         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1836"><span class="dropcap-rw">C</span>amilla poured herself a large gin and tonic in a beer glass. She sat on the terrace and looked out over the fjord at Ring Island, at the ducks rocking in the lazy waters. Her body still tingled with some exhaustion she couldn’t shake.</p>
         <p id="p1837">Frederik startled her when he yelled from the kitchen. She hadn’t heard him come home; she hadn’t even noticed that the wind was chilly now, that she had goose bumps on her bare arms.</p>
         <p id="p1838">She’d called him when she got home from the forest, after the ambulance had left with Sune. He still had a board meeting and a telephone conference with the American office, but she had been okay with that. She needed some time alone.</p>
         <p id="p1839">Jonas and Markus had gone into Roskilde to “hang out,” as they put it. She’d lacked the energy to determine how likely it was that beer and cigarettes were part of the plan. Or if they were just sitting innocently in the city park, listening to music.</p>
         <p id="p1840">Her thoughts had been with Sune after Louise had called. The latest report was that his condition had stabilized. She’d found him in time.</p>
         <p id="p1841">She caught herself feeling useless. Even though she didn’t know Sune, and she couldn’t help at the hospital, she felt close to him. Suddenly everything seemed empty.</p>
         <p id="p1842">“What the hell happened to the tree?”</p>
         <p id="p1843">Camilla turned, and she jumped up when she saw Frederik’s face. “The tree?”</p>
         <p id="p1844">“Someone disfigured the warden tree. They must have used a chain saw.” He was already on his way back to the courtyard.</p>
         <p id="p1845">She emptied her glass; the alcohol burned all the way down. She followed him through the kitchen and out to the front steps, where she stopped abruptly.</p>
         <p id="p1846">Large patches of white wood showed where the tree trunk had been ripped into. On the ground under the tree lay piles of wood shavings, like hair on the floor of a beauty salon. When she touched the exposed wood, it felt damp.</p>
         <p id="p1847">The defacing began half a meter above the ground. Camilla’s first impression was that it looked like graffiti on a newly painted wall. It enraged her. Slowly, she approached the tree while Frederik walked around it with his phone to his ear. Tønnesen, Camilla guessed.</p>
         <p id="p1848">Why hadn’t she heard it? Camilla counted twelve separate areas where the trunk had been damaged. That must have taken time. Then she thought about Sune.</p>
         <p id="p1849">“They were here while the boy was dying,” she said, shocked at the notion that someone was cutting here while she and Elinor were calling the ambulance. She’d returned directly from the forest without coming around front.</p>
         <p id="p1850">“Tønnesen is on his way,” Frederik said. “I want that tree taken down. I’m not going to let them think they can scare us this way.”</p>
         <p id="p1851">“Do you think that’s wise?” She hadn’t realized it before, but the old superstition in fact made Camilla nervous.</p>
         <p id="p1852">Frederik backed off and craned his neck, looking up at the treetops. He shrugged. “At least it will show people that we won’t be threatened.” From the way he spoke, she knew he’d already decided.</p>
         <p id="p1853">“Who knows we have a warden tree?” she asked. She noticed one mark on the trunk that seemed different from the others.</p>
         <p id="p1854">“Probably everyone around here who believes in that sort of thing, who takes an interest in the old mythology,” he said.</p>
         <p id="p1855">She wanted him to look at something, and he joined her. “Has this always been here?” she asked, though the question was unnecessary—the exposed wood was fresh.</p>
         <p id="p1856">Frederik ran his finger around the carved circle, inside of which was a cross with small marks on the ends. “I think it’s a rune.”</p>
         <p id="p1857">Camilla took a picture with her phone. She assumed she could Google runes. At that moment, the manager drove into the courtyard and jumped out of his car.</p>
         <p id="p1858">“What the heck happened here?” he said, though Frederik had already told him everything. It was obvious what had happened.</p>
         <p id="p1859">Camilla walked back to the house in a daze. A week ago she would have thought role-playing and Viking markets if someone had mentioned Asatro. It would never have occurred to her that some people actually practiced it, truly believed in it.</p>
         <p id="p1860">Confused, she sat down in the kitchen. What were they trying to say? She didn’t understand why someone had turned against them. But she agreed with Frederik: The tree had to come down. They couldn’t let anyone intimidate them this way.</p>
