         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1694"><span class="dropcap-rw">T</span>hey drove over the hill outside Særløse. Louise gazed at John Knudsen’s dilapidated farm. Two unmarked police cars were parked on the road, and several people were milling around the farm.</p>
         <p id="p1695">He could be there, she thought. They could have hidden Sune in the big barn where Pussy had drowned the newborn kittens.</p>
         <p id="p1696">No one spoke in the car, but she saw from Big Thomsen’s expression in the side mirror that he was thinking. He must have realized by now that he wasn’t the only one the police were interested in. Apparently that relieved him; he slumped down in his seat up front and stared straight ahead.</p>
         <p id="p1697">She called Nymand and reported in a few short words that they had finished their search. Negative, she said. They were headed for the address where Thomsen claimed he’d spent the night.</p>
         <p id="p1698">“Have the others reported in?” she asked. He told her that the team searching the mason’s house in Såby had finished. No sign of the boy there, either.</p>
         <p id="p1699">“At first he claimed he knew nothing about Sune Frandsen. He’d never heard of a nithing pole and had no idea where Ingersminde was,” Nymand said.</p>
         <p id="p1700"><i>Liar</i>, Louise thought. The mason had worked a long time at Camilla’s manor. She’d hired his company to do the renovation.</p>
         <p id="p1701">The team searching Pussy’s farm hadn’t reported back yet.</p>
         <p id="p1702">Louise looked away as they drove past the gamekeeper’s house and into the forest. She hadn’t been there since the night she was attacked, but she knew that the house had been empty since Bodil Parkov had moved out.</p>
         <p id="p1703">She smiled to herself at how Eik confidently took the road past Avnsø to get to Bitten’s house. The first time they were in the forest together, she’d had the impression that he’d never been that far away from Sydhavnen. And now, he was driving around as if he’d lived there his entire life.</p>

         </div>
         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1705">Bitten’s forest ranger house came into sight, and Louise noticed someone outside. From the boyish form and the short hair, she thought it must be Sune walking around, though she’d only seen his picture. Then she realized the figure in tight jeans and long-sleeved T-shirt was Bitten.</p>
         <p id="p1706">“What the hell!” Thomsen straightened up in his seat as they neared the house. All his things lay piled up in the middle of the courtyard. Bitten had gone back inside, and now an armful of clothes came flying out the door.</p>
         <p id="p1707">Thomsen shoved the car door open. “What in hell are you doing, you crazy bitch?”</p>
         <p id="p1708">Bitten whirled around; she hadn’t heard them drive in. She stood with her hands on her hips, her expression telling the world that she wasn’t backing down.</p>
         <p id="p1709">Louise and Eik were on Thomsen’s heels as he strode across the courtyard; several of the tall, broken hollyhocks outside the door drooped close to the cobblestones. Bitten meant business, it seemed.</p>
         <p id="p1710">“You can take your fucking shit and go to hell,” Bitten snapped when Thomsen started shouting at her again.</p>
         <p id="p1711">René’s frail wife had also managed to drag his big chair out to the courtyard. It lay on its side, the large flat-screen TV on top of it. Thomsen’s face turned red when he saw it. He stepped up to Bitten, and before Louise and Eik could stop him he punched her in the face.</p>
         <p id="p1712">“You’re going to regret this,” he said, hunched over now as Eik twisted his arm from behind and pulled him back.</p>
         <p id="p1713">Bitten didn’t answer. She held her hand to her cheek as blood began to flow from her nose onto the back of her hand. But she looked defiantly at Thomsen.</p>
         <p id="p1714">“You are the biggest asshole to ever walk on two legs,” she said. “I never want to see you again.”</p>
         <p id="p1715">“What happened?” Louise asked as Eik steered Big Thomsen back to the car, threatening him with charges of battery.</p>
         <p id="p1716">“René refused to see me when I visited him today.” Bitten’s voice was nearly unrecognizable from bitterness. “Asshole there apparently delivered a message to him, told him I wanted a divorce, that I’d hired a lawyer, the papers were already written up. I’ve never said I wanted a divorce, and then when I tried to use my debit card, it was blocked. I went to the bank, and they told me that René’s salary, which usually goes into our joint account, hadn’t come in. And I thought I was helping René by being friendly to Thomsen while he was in jail.”</p>
         <p id="p1717">Bitten wiped her hand on her jeans, a smear of blood appearing on her thigh. Her nose was still bleeding, and Louise suggested they go inside so she could put ice on it.</p>
         <p id="p1718">“All the while he’s been saying he’d help me and my daughter—that everything would be all right. He’d keep René on the payroll so we wouldn’t suffer.” In the kitchen, Louise wrapped a washcloth around ice and held it to Bitten’s nose. She continued to explain how she’d been used, how she felt like she’d walked into a trap.</p>
         <p id="p1719">“He’s here all the time. The deal was that he would come only when my daughter was asleep or not home, and now he insists on taking her to school in the morning and being part of the family. He’s taken over everything. Today he was sleeping in bed when I came home from the jail. Do you know what he said when I asked why he was destroying my family?”</p>
         <p id="p1720">Bitten’s face was contorted with rage. “He said he would crush René, just because he could! Like he was talking about swatting a fly!”</p>
         <p id="p1721">She threw the washcloth down and dried her cheek on her sleeve. “He said that nobody got away with stabbing him in the back.”</p>
         <p id="p1722">“Stabbing him in the back?” Louise said.</p>
         <p id="p1723">“He’d heard that René told you about the rituals out in the forest, and the woman, too, the boy’s gift.”</p>
         <p id="p1724">Louise was stunned. “Just how did he know about that?”</p>
         <p id="p1725">Bitten looked away. Finally she answered, “He shoots skeet with an officer who helped question René.”</p>
         <p id="p1726">Enraged, Louise grabbed her phone to call Nymand. Bitten rested her forehead on her hand and shook her head, as if she had no idea what to do. “So while I’m being told all this, the bastard is in my bed, snoring!”</p>
         <p id="p1727">Louise stuck her phone back in her pocket and put her arm around René’s wife. “Did he spend the night with you?”</p>
         <p id="p1728">Bitten nodded. “He came around eight, emptied the refrigerator, and plopped down in front of the TV. He didn’t even say good night when he came to bed, and he was still asleep when I left to visit René.”</p>
         <p id="p1729">“And you’re sure he was here all night.”</p>
         <p id="p1730">Bitten frowned at her. “When a man snores like he does, you know he’s in the house.”</p>
         <p id="p1731">Louise’s phone rang. Camilla’s name popped up on the display. She excused herself and answered. “Hi.”</p>
         <p id="p1732">“I found Sune,” her friend whispered.</p>
