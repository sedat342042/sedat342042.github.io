         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1504"><span class="dropcap-rw">W</span>hat was that?” Camilla asked, grabbing Frederik’s arm.</p>
         <p id="p1505">He tried to figure out where the shrill screams were coming from, then he vanished into the forest. Camilla tossed away the sack they’d brought for the boy and humped after him.</p>
         <p id="p1506">Moments later, she saw that Frederik had stopped; a large figure in a dark-green hunting jacket was dragging someone—the boy! He was still screaming, and her heart constricted when she saw the terror in his face.</p>
         <p id="p1507">“What the hell’s going on here?” Frederik yelled. He sprinted over and reached for the boy, but was slammed to the ground as if he’d been hit by a bear. The man began tottering; Camilla guessed that Frederik had grabbed on to his legs, but all she could see was a broad back and a leg kicking at Frederik. When the man leaned over, the boy wrestled free and ran to Camilla, hiding behind her back, as if he were safe there.</p>
         <p id="p1508">Through the trees she glimpsed Frederik, back on his feet now, but swaying. He steadied himself up against a tree, then he took off after the man, who had disappeared down the forest road.</p>
         <p id="p1509">“Frederik!” she yelled. “Stop!”</p>
         <p id="p1510">Suddenly the forest was completely still. All she heard was her own rapid breathing and the boy’s quiet sobbing. His shoulders shook, and he pulled away from her as if he were embarrassed to have hidden behind her. He was skinny and shabby; his hands and clothes were filthy. Camilla reached for him.</p>
         <p id="p1511">“It’s all over,” she said, comforting him, but she was interrupted by more shouting. She recognized Frederik’s voice. Then she heard a car door slam, an engine racing furiously. The car’s tires squealed as it took off.</p>
         <p id="p1512">“My dad,” the boy whispered. “I have to find my dad.”</p>
         <p id="p1513">“Where is he?” Camilla asked. For a moment she was in doubt; should she follow the boy or rush over and find Frederik? She humped after the boy through the forest, past a stack of firewood and a clump of ferns. They fought their way through bushes, trampling down some wild raspberries.</p>
         <p id="p1514">“Dad!” The boy started to run. Camilla tried to keep up. They both stopped when they reached the sacrificial oak. The boy had made a small camp behind a thicket, in between some low bushes and a few logs. He’d cleared a space for a campfire, and on the ground beside it was her son’s blue jacket. Apart from that the camp looked deserted.</p>
         <p id="p1515">“He’s gone!” the boy wailed.</p>
         <p id="p1516">“But weren’t you running away from him?” Camilla asked, and looked around. Nothing was moving.</p>
         <p id="p1517">“No, Dad came here to get me. He was trying to help me.”</p>
         <p id="p1518">He fell to the ground and hid his face in his hands. His thin shoulders began shaking again. Camilla eased down beside him and put her hand on his back. “We’ll find your father,” she said. “I can drive you home.”</p>
         <p id="p1519">He shook his head almost imperceptibly. “I can’t go home,” he whispered, almost in a panic. “They’ve turned against Dad.”</p>
         <p id="p1520">“I’m sure everything will be all right now,” Camilla said.</p>
         <p id="p1521">“You don’t understand. They’ll kill me.”</p>
         <p id="p1522">“No one’s going to kill a child,” Camilla exclaimed. Then she thought about the bodies in the girls’ graves less than half a kilometer away.</p>
         <p id="p1523">A man’s voice cried out, “Hello!” The boy gave a start.</p>
         <p id="p1524">“Easy, it’s my husband,” Camilla said. “Over here!” she shouted.</p>
         <p id="p1525">Frederik appeared in the clearing and walked toward them. “What on earth happened?” she said, shocked at the sight of him. His clothes were covered in mud, and he was bleeding at the temple.</p>
         <p id="p1526">“He tried to run me down. I had to jump in the ditch.”</p>
         <p id="p1527">“Maybe he’s the one who hit me,” Camilla said, her fist clenched in anger. “He’s a total maniac.”</p>
         <p id="p1528">They both turned to the boy.</p>
         <p id="p1529">“They won’t stop until they find me,” he said, crying again. “And I don’t know where to go.”</p>
         <p id="p1530">Camilla stood and helped him up. “Come with us. We’ll find a way out of this. The police are going to be very happy to hear that you’re all right.”</p>
         <p id="p1531">But the boy still resisted, and for a moment she feared he would run away again.</p>
         <p id="p1532">“Dad might still be out here,” he said.</p>
         <p id="p1533">“Then let’s wait a while,” Camilla suggested. “You could also try to call him.”</p>
         <p id="p1534">She handed him her phone, but he didn’t take it. His stomach was growling, and she could see that he was freezing. “Honestly, you could stand a bath.” She smiled at him. “And you look like you could eat a decent meal. Sometimes things look different after a good night’s sleep. Okay?”</p>
         <p id="p1535">He seemed more at ease now, but he kept peering into the forest. “I want to go with you, but you have to promise not to call anyone. I think Dad will come back for me tomorrow.”</p>
         <p id="p1536">“We promise,” Frederik said. He placed his hand on the boy’s shoulder.</p>
