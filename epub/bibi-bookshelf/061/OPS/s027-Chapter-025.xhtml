         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1174"><span class="dropcap-rw">W</span>hen they drove past the lake, Louise realized she hadn’t been inside Hvalsø School since she’d graduated from ninth grade. School had practically been her whole life back then. It had ended so abruptly. But why should she have come back? After you graduate, there’s no reason to return.</p>
         <p id="p1175">She did remember her way around. She directed Eik to park in front of the auditorium, and they walked past the bicycle sheds. It was a shortcut, plus they wouldn’t have to use the main entrance. But they would have to go through the cafeteria, where curious eyes would follow them all the way to the principal’s office.</p>
         <p id="p1176">The sense of being in familiar territory slowly faded when she discovered that the cafeteria wasn’t there anymore. And of course she realized Mother Ellen wouldn’t be selling sandwiches and candy to the older students. She actually felt a bit indignant over all the changes in her old school.</p>
         <p id="p1177">They explained to the woman in the secretary’s office that they wanted to speak to Sune Frandsen, and they were sorry it had to be during classes, seeing that he had just returned to school.</p>
         <p id="p1178">The secretary looked surprised, but she recovered quickly and smiled. “I wasn’t aware he was back. That’s so nice to hear. He’s a very sweet boy, and no one could understand why he would do such a thing. To take his own life…” She seemed upset suddenly. “No child or young person—no one at all—should be able to go so far. Oh dear. Well, if you’ll have a seat, I’ll bring him in a moment.”</p>
         <p id="p1179">She pointed at two chairs under a wide photograph of the school. Gray cement, rust-red square windows. A long line of students stood in front of the school. Louise remembered when that picture had been taken. In fact, she was in it somewhere.</p>
         <p id="p1180">The principal came out of his office. They introduced themselves and nodded when he said that he’d been hoping this regrettable case would have a happy ending.</p>
         <p id="p1181">“Last week we held an assembly for ninth-grade classes. We talked to them about how life can be difficult and confusing; how sometimes you just want to give up.”</p>
         <p id="p1182">The secretary returned, accompanied by Sune’s class teacher.</p>
         <p id="p1183">“Who told you that Sune was in school?” The teacher looked back and forth at Louise and Eik. “Because he’s not. His classmates haven’t seen him, either. Who told you that?”</p>
         <p id="p1184">“We’ve just spoken with his father,” Eik said. “He said that Sune had started school again.”</p>
         <p id="p1185">The teacher was visibly upset. “I’ve talked about it several times. We should contact social services and find out what’s going on in that home. But no one does anything. I’ve called the district, tried to convince them to visit the parents. Nothing happens. It’s not so strange that things like what happened in Tønder and Mern take place—no one has the time anymore to protect the interests of children. It’s all about money, passing the buck to someone else, taking on less yourself.”</p>
         <p id="p1186">“Easy now, I think we should…” The principal sputtered, then recovered. “I’ll call his parents and see what they have to say.”</p>
         <p id="p1187">“I’m not saying this is a case of abuse or neglect,” the teacher said. “But when a fifteen-year-old boy vanishes into thin air this way, something is very wrong. I’ve said so from the beginning, and even when he showed up on that photo, no one wanted to listen.”</p>
         <p id="p1188">“We’ve done nothing but work on this case, ever since you pointed out that newspaper photo to the police in Holbæk,” Eik said, and stood up. He was a head taller than Sune’s teacher. Ordinarily this cop in black clothes and leather jacket, his longish hair combed back, didn’t look threatening. But he was annoyed. “There’s no certainty that the family is in any way at fault. But we suspect that Sune might have witnessed a serious crime. That could be why he’s hiding. We can’t really fault the family for that.”</p>
         <p id="p1189">Louise watched the young schoolteacher retreat.</p>
         <p id="p1190">“Could he be in danger?” the principal asked.</p>
         <p id="p1191">“Possibly,” Louise admitted. She emphasized that they very much wanted to talk to Sune. “If he does show up, please call us at once. We’re going to pay a visit to his parents. Hopefully, we’ll find him there.”</p>
         <p id="p1192">On the way out, she glanced once more at the school photograph. Klaus had to be somewhere in it, too.</p>
