         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1733"><span class="dropcap-rw">C</span>amilla had been sitting in their yard, under a parasol, when Elinor suddenly appeared on the terrace and held out her hand. She’d smiled and said hello; she was getting used to the old woman showing up out of nowhere. But Elinor walked off, still beckoning at Camilla, who then got the message.</p>
         <p id="p1734">They went down the forest path silently. The old woman’s cane crackled each time she planted it on the ground, but she kept a pace that Camilla, her leg still hurting, struggled to match.</p>
         <p id="p1735">She was apprehensive when they neared the sacrificial oak in the silent, mysterious forest. Elinor stopped and pointed, and her expression made Camilla even more anxious. She gathered her nerve and looked, then she covered her mouth in shock when she recognized the dark blue jacket and the lifeless body leaning up against the tree.</p>
         <p id="p1736">Sune’s head hung on his chest, his hair covering his eyes. What froze Camilla, however, was the sight of his right forearm covered in dark blood. She dreaded doing it, but she had to kneel down and press her finger against his throat, check for a pulse. She closed her eyes and concentrated.</p>
         <p id="p1737">When she stood up, she was shaking so badly that she could barely pull her phone out of her pocket. She crouched down and punched in the emergency number. Time seemed to stand still; she feared she’d gotten there too late. She surprised herself by describing precisely the location in the forest, and after she asked that the information be given to Deputy Commissioner Nymand, the dispatcher told her the ambulance was on its way.</p>
         <p id="p1738">“I think he’s breathing. It’s hard for me to tell,” Camilla said hesitantly, unsure whether the dispatcher was listening. Then she called Louise, but later she could hardly remember what she’d said; all her attention was on the boy, checking for signs of life. Fingers moving, chest rising. But he simply wasn’t moving.</p>
         <p id="p1739">Slowly, she realized what had happened. The blood came from his right elbow, and his vein had been cut. There was no doubt about the symbolism—Sune had been placed under the tree as a sacrifice to the gods.</p>
         <p id="p1740">Desperately, she watched Elinor walk around in small circles over by the bonfire site. Her lips were moving, but no sound came out.</p>
         <p id="p1741">From her stint on the crime desk of a newspaper, Camilla knew that a person with a main artery cut had very little time. She pulled herself together and ripped off her blouse, tearing it into rags.</p>
         <p id="p1742">“It’s going to be all right,” she mumbled. She began speaking to him in a calm voice, as much for her sake as his. She lay him on the ground and lifted his legs, rested them on the tree trunk so the blood would run down to his head, and bound strips of cloth around Sune’s upper arm. The ambulance wailed in the distance. Her mind was racing; heart massage, artificial respiration—would she be doing more harm than good? She grabbed a small stick, stuck it in between the windings of cloth, and twisted the stick to tighten the tourniquet.</p>
