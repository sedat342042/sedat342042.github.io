         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1041"><span class="dropcap-rw">E</span>linor looked like a tiny pawn on an enormous chessboard. She leaned on her cane, a bowed old woman standing on the grave as if someone had nailed her to it.</p>
         <p id="p1042">“Hi, Elinor,” Camilla called out.</p>
         <p id="p1043">Morning dew still covered the grass in the forest meadow. The graves were ringed with dark gravel all the way around. They had probably been well cared for at one time, she thought, but now bushes had overtaken several of them. The low hedge from long ago, probably a windbreak, had grown out of shape, and long tufts of grass had sprouted up on the graves themselves. The entire area had been neglected and was fast returning to nature.</p>
         <p id="p1044">“The police need her out of the way,” Louise repeated.</p>
         <p id="p1045">She walked over to join Nymand and his crime scene technicians. They had carefully dug down beside the body, and now they were pushing a plate in underneath to lift it out. The corpse and the earth around it would be taken in for examination.</p>
         <p id="p1046">Shadows from the treetops danced on the earth in front of Camilla’s feet; ground mist rose from a small hollow at the edge of the forest, just beyond the old gnarled tree. She shivered in the cool morning breeze.</p>
         <p id="p1047">“The wagons are rolling on the Death Trail,” the old woman mumbled.</p>
         <p id="p1048">“How is she in the way?” Camilla asked the dog handler, who stood a few meters away. “When you’re focused on the graves over there.”</p>
         <p id="p1049">“You have to get her to move so we can do our job,” was all he said. He stared openly at her black-and-blue face.</p>
         <p id="p1050">Elinor kept mumbling. Camilla held a hand out to her, but she ignored it. Camilla lowered her hand and stepped back. The earth was dark where the old woman stood; there was no green grass. It looked as if someone had been digging around.</p>
         <p id="p1051">“Listen, goddamn it, she’s not doing this just to bother you,” Camilla said. She hobbled over to the policeman. “Instead of standing there looking like an old grouch, you could walk over to her and take a look. The dirt’s different from the other graves.”</p>
         <p id="p1052">“Yeah, maybe! Except it’s hard to see as long as she’s standing on it.”</p>
         <p id="p1053">Camilla looked around for Nymand.</p>
         <p id="p1054">Elinor stirred. Hunched over, looking down at the ground, she turned and walked away from the grave. Camilla followed her. Now she was convinced that Elinor only wanted to point out the grave to her. Once she was sure that Camilla understood, she moved away.</p>
         <p id="p1055">Camilla hurried to follow the old lady. It wasn’t just the morning chill bringing out goose bumps on her skin; she had a vague feeling that something was about to happen. Something not at all nice.</p>
         <p id="p1056">Elinor strode past two gravestones and stopped beside the third. The grave looked like all the others, the same gray, simple stone plate set slightly crooked in the ground. Camilla crouched down and was about to read when a man’s voice boomed from behind and startled her.</p>
         <p id="p1057">“Got something over here!” said a tall, husky policeman. Camilla noticed that the dog handler had straightened up, now that his dog showed interest where Elinor had stood. Nymand and his men rushed over.</p>
         <p id="p1058">“What’s happening?” she yelled. She put a hand on Elinor’s arm. “I’m going back to see what this is all about.”</p>
         <p id="p1059">But as she was about to turn, Elinor grabbed her. “The wagons are rolling on the Death Trail.”</p>
         <p id="p1060">Technicians in a blue van backed up to the grave where Elinor had been standing. Two men in white coveralls carefully began scraping the earth away.</p>
         <p id="p1061">“Positive!” someone yelled.</p>
         <p id="p1062">Camilla was rushing toward them when suddenly she felt a strong hand on the back of her shoulder. “Stay here!” a policeman said.</p>
         <p id="p1063">“What’s going on? And take your hand off me!” She squirmed.</p>
         <p id="p1064">“It looks like they found another body,” he said, letting go of her.</p>
         <p id="p1065">“You mean, a body buried there where Elinor was?”</p>
         <p id="p1066">“It looks that way.”</p>
         <p id="p1067">Camilla froze a second before whirling toward Elinor, her feet planted on the grave behind them. Their eyes met, then the old woman turned and walked toward the forest.</p>
         <p id="p1068">Camilla called her name. She wanted to run after her, but the pain in her legs and the husky policeman stopped her. “What’s that old witch up to?” He stared after her.</p>
         <p id="p1069">Camilla slumped. She looked at the grave the old woman had just left. She heard the dog handler praising his dog, the dog snapping at the snack the man had tossed at him. She sensed the stillness of the forest, though everything around her was in motion. It was as if she were in the middle of a movie set where a mass grave was being uncovered right before her eyes.</p>
         <p id="p1070">“I think there’s another grave here you should look at,” she said, pointing.</p>
         <p id="p1071">“Nymand!” the policeman called out across the clearing.</p>
         <p id="p1072">Camilla couldn’t move when the officer asked the dog handler to check the grave she’d singled out. She felt she knew what she was about to see.</p>
         <p id="p1073">Her eyes followed the policeman and his dog in slow motion. They stopped at the grave. The dog sniffed around, but it made no noise when it looked up at its handler. He said something to the officer beside Camilla; she couldn’t hear what, could only see his mouth moving. She looked back down at the grave.</p>
         <p id="p1074">“Negative,” the officer said.</p>
         <p id="p1075">She grabbed him before he walked away. “There <i>is</i> something. Or else she wouldn’t have shown us the grave.” She ignored his remark that crime scenes always attract weirdos trying to draw attention to themselves. “She was right a few minutes ago,” Camilla said, pointing to the first grave, which several of the technicians huddled around. The mood was tense. They worked fast, focusing on what was being dug up while speaking in low voices.</p>
         <p id="p1076">Louise came over to her. “It’s a young woman. It looks like she’s been in the ground only a short time. She probably won’t be difficult to identify, if we can find a missing person matching her description.”</p>
         <p id="p1077">“How could this happen?” Camilla whispered. Her chest felt tight; even though she had covered many cases while on the crime desk at <i>Morgenavisen</i>, she had never gotten used to the sight of a corpse. “Why are all these bodies showing up here?”</p>
         <p id="p1078">She had to sit down. Her scalp tingled as the blood drained out of her cheeks.</p>
         <p id="p1079">Louise shook her head. She had no answer.</p>
         <p id="p1080">“You have to check the last grave Elinor showed me,” Camilla said. She looked up at her friend. “The dog may not have smelled anything, but I’m sure there’s something. It’s obvious she wanted us to look there.”</p>
         <p id="p1081">“My guess is that the entire area will be cordoned off. Nymand will call in an archaeologist with knowledge of disturbed sites, who can tell us where someone has been digging recently.” Louise started to walk back to the others.</p>
         <p id="p1082">Camilla followed her. “Who could she be, that woman you just found?”</p>
         <p id="p1083">“It’s hard to say. She’s young, probably early twenties.”</p>
         <p id="p1084">“What’s she look like?”</p>
         <p id="p1085">“Thin, almost naked, long blond hair,” Louise said. “A tattoo around one wrist, another one down by her hip. I couldn’t see what it was.”</p>
         <p id="p1086">Camilla stayed in the background as Louise approached the technician and pointed out the final grave Elinor had stood at.</p>
         <p id="p1087">“Can you see how the young woman died?” Camilla asked when Louise returned. But at that moment Nymand ordered everyone to leave.</p>
         <p id="p1088">“We don’t want anyone tramping around here until we’ve secured the entire area,” he yelled. He looked at Camilla.</p>
         <p id="p1089">Several times over the years in her work as a journalist, she’d gone through unsolved cases. She could remember several of them, but none involving the murder of a woman in the Roskilde area.</p>
         <p id="p1090">“This is going to take some time,” Louise said. She put her arm around Camilla’s shoulder when she began to sway. “Nymand is calling everything to a halt until an archaeologist looks at the site. He’ll also look at the last grave Elinor pointed out to you. If there’s been any digging there, the vegetation will probably show it.”</p>
         <p id="p1091">A policeman came over and asked Camilla to leave. “We’re securing the entire area,” he said. He nodded toward the forest, as if he expected her to run right in there.</p>
         <p id="p1092">“We’re parked over there,” Camilla said. She pointed at the other side of the gnarled tree.</p>
         <p id="p1093">“Then you’ll have to walk around,” he said, and he began pushing her.</p>
         <p id="p1094">She’d had enough. She was freezing, her leg hurt, and the whole scene in front of her was surreal. The last thing she wanted to hear was a young officer with a shaved head ordering her around.</p>
         <p id="p1095">“Get your hands off me! This is my forest!”</p>
         <p id="p1096">“That may be, but right now it’s a crime scene. So I’m going to have to ask you to leave the area.”</p>
         <p id="p1097">There were probably a thousand things she could have snapped back at him, but instead she sighed and gave up. She just wanted to go home and lie down.</p>
         <p id="p1098">“Eik and I are heading back to town,” Louise said, as she followed her to the car. “We’re going into the station to check the national missing person files.”</p>
