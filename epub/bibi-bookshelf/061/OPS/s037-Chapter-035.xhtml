         </div>
         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1640"><span class="dropcap-rw">H</span>e could be anywhere. The possibilities seemed endless to Louise as she sat in Eik’s car, watching the fields around Skov Hastrup slip by. There were so many places you could easily hide a fifteen-year-old boy. Empty Boy Scout cabins. All the barns in the area. Haylofts, sheds out in the forest. A search would be immensely difficult if Thomsen had decided to stow the boy away.</p>
         <p id="p1641">After they had handed the butcher over to a few of Nymand’s men so he could help find Sune, Louise thought the gnawing in her stomach came from knowing there was little time. It had started when she heard of Sune’s disappearance from Camilla and Frederik’s house. But now, as Eik turned onto Kvandrupvej and headed for Big Thomsen’s farm, she realized the source of her dread was the thought of what these men might put the boy through. The butcher was absolutely right. If anyone knew how far they would go to stop whoever was in their way, she did.</p>
         <p id="p1642">“Come on, come on, damn it,” she barked as Eik took a curve and Thomsen’s farm came into sight. Instead he slowed down.</p>
         <p id="p1643">“Have they called in?” he asked.</p>
         <p id="p1644">Louise clenched her teeth and shook her head. Nymand had sent his men out to the mason in Såby and Pussy’s farm in Særløse, which was less than a kilometer from her and Eik. The plan was that when they were close to their destinations they would text Nymand, who then would ensure that the searches took place simultaneously.</p>
         <p id="p1645">Louise had just texted him that they were ready. She stared at her phone’s display, waiting for <i>Go</i>.</p>
         <p id="p1646">She gave Eik points for not saying anything about her pushing him, when all they could do was sit and wait. She glanced at him. His longish dark hair was combed back. He had thrown his leather jacket in the backseat of the car, and now she noticed he was wearing a white T-shirt, not black. He always wore black T-shirts.</p>
         <p id="p1647">When they had first met, he admitted to her that he dressed in black solely because he hated shopping. He bought clothes in stacks. Ten black T-shirts, five pairs of black Levi’s, same model. Black socks. He didn’t wear underwear, he told her. He picked up that habit during a long journey in India.</p>
         <p id="p1648">Now she noticed that the T-shirt wasn’t the only thing different. The two thin yellow and green strings he usually wore around his wrist were gone, as was his shark’s tooth necklace. She’d never asked him about these things; she had the impression that he’d been wearing them since his girlfriend disappeared.</p>
         <p id="p1649">She wanted to lay her hand on his arm, to feel his sinewy muscles, the warmth of his body.</p>
         <p id="p1650">“Do you really think they might kill the boy?”</p>
         <p id="p1651">Louise straightened up. Was it possible? She thought about it for a while, then nodded. “I’m afraid so. To save their own asses. I’m afraid they’ll do almost anything to avoid a murder charge. If they have any brains at all, they’ll know that’s exactly what they’re facing if Sune talks. And if things start falling apart for them, who knows what else will come to light.”</p>
         <p id="p1652">“But killing a boy?”</p>
         <p id="p1653">“That’s not how they see it. He’s not a boy to them. In their world, he’s an adult who broke a vow of silence.”</p>
         <p id="p1654">“In their world?”</p>
         <p id="p1655">“Maybe that’s not how things work in the city,” she said, annoyed at him now. “But out here, people stick together. I think that’s how it is in most small communities. You stick together, and from what I’ve seen, it’s plain that Thomsen and his gang have taken this type of solidarity to extremes. The butcher said it. It’s not a question of friendship now, it’s like a street gang or sect no one can get out of. That’s why I think it’s all the same to them if someone’s fifteen or thirty.”</p>
         <p id="p1656">That feeling in her stomach, that anxiety, was anger now. “Back when we had parties in school, friends took care of each other. If someone was getting beat up, friends stepped in. Those were the rules, and I think everyone was okay with that, with what friends were expected to do.”</p>
         <p id="p1657">Eik grunted, but he didn’t comment. She wasn’t sure what he thought about all this.</p>
         <p id="p1658">“It’s not very politically correct,” she said, “but I can’t say I wouldn’t do the same. If I were out with Camilla, and somebody jumped her, I’d get involved.”</p>
         <p id="p1659">“That’d be something to see,” he mumbled.</p>
         <p id="p1660">Louise ignored him. Instead she leaned over, and she was about to comment on his T-shirt when her phone rang. “Let’s go,” Nymand said.</p>
         <div class="decoration-rw" id="decoration20">
            <p class="center-rw" id="p1661">*  *  *</p>
         </div>
         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1662">Eik floored it. Fields and corrals flew by, but all Louise saw was the image of Big Thomsen, Sune’s tormentor, who had resorted to violence to nab him. She was more than ready to get in his face about that.</p>
         <p id="p1663">The farmhouse’s white gable came into view. Thomsen’s Toyota Land Cruiser was parked at the end of one wing, its tailgate open.</p>
         <p id="p1664">“Showtime,” Eik said, and he drove in.</p>
         <p id="p1665">Their plan was that if Thomsen didn’t come out, Louise would take the back door, Eik would stay out front. If he wasn’t home, they would have to contact a neighbor to witness the search. But none of this was necessary; Big Thomsen walked out the minute Eik drove up.</p>
         <p id="p1666">He didn’t seem thrilled to see them, but neither did he act as if he’d been expecting them. He looked like his normal self, laid-back, his hands in the pockets of his blue work pants. He clearly meant to appear standoffish, but for whatever reason it didn’t work on Louise, who walked up to him and said they would like his permission to search his property.</p>
         <p id="p1667">Eik spoke up from behind her. “We have a warrant, of c—”</p>
         <p id="p1668">“Stop!” Louise shouted, as Thomsen lifted his phone to his ear. “No calls. You’re going back inside with my colleague, and you two can have a chat while I look around.”</p>
         <p id="p1669">“This is not all right, you going around harassing citizens this way all the time. What is it you think I’ve done?”</p>
         <p id="p1670">She wanted to tell him there were plenty of reasons why they’d returned. She wanted to yell it in his face. She couldn’t stop thinking of Sune, and of the three-year-old boy without a mother to care for him. But she contented herself with giving him a dirty look.</p>
         <p id="p1671">“We’re not saying you’ve done anything,” Eik said as he herded him toward the house. “But we know you were out in Boserup Forest last night, dragging a fifteen-year-old boy to your car. We also know you had a scrap with the boy’s father, but Sune managed to get away. We want to know where the boy is.”</p>
         <p id="p1672">“I wasn’t out in any forest last night. And how the hell should I know where the boy is?” Thomsen sounded amused. “And I haven’t ‘had a scrap’ with anyone. Either you fight or you don’t fight.”</p>
         <p id="p1673">“You argued with the boy’s father out in the forest,” Eik stated.</p>
         <p id="p1674">“I don’t know what you’re talking about. But in case you don’t know, the boy’s mother is very sick, and don’t you suppose she’d like to see her son before she kicks the bucket?”</p>
         <p id="p1675">Louise’s fists were clenched; she was two seconds away from jumping all over Big Thomsen, but Eik held his hand up to stop her. For a moment she quivered in anger, but then she turned on her heel and strode over to the barn wing of the farmhouse.</p>
         <p id="p1676">“That boy needs a whipping, the way he’s making his mother suffer…”</p>
         <p id="p1677">That’s all Louise heard before entering the darkness of the barn. Long ago, animals had probably been kept in there, pigs or cattle, maybe chickens. The ceilings were low, and tall bricked-up steps divided the three rooms. It smelled dusty and sour from the moldy walls. Only the middle room looked to be in use.</p>
         <p id="p1678">She walked over to the discarded furniture and junk piled up on the floor. Against the wall stood a packing box filled with porcelain and an old trunk, its lid missing.</p>
         <p id="p1679">But there was no sign of the boy, not there or in the two other empty rooms, their windowpanes too gray from dirt and cobwebs for the sunshine outside to penetrate.</p>
         <p id="p1680">Eik and Big Thomsen were gone when she walked outside, and the door to the middle wing where Thomsen lived was closed. She hurried over to another wing. Its inner walls had been torn down, and it smelled like dried grass and motor oil: a garden tractor big enough for a city park dominated the middle of the room. A sheet of plywood covered with black outlines of various tools hung on the end wall. Hammers, saws, squares. For a moment she was impressed with the level of organization, in contrast with the mess Thomsen had made at Bitten’s house.</p>
         <p id="p1681">Outside, she looked at the gables for a way to get up into the lofts of the two wings. She spotted a black wooden hatch door on the one gable, flush with the wall, its latch covered with as many cobwebs as the windows below. It hadn’t been opened for ages.</p>
         <p id="p1682">She walked over to the middle-wing residence. Through the window, she noticed Thomsen gesturing at Eik, as if he was emphasizing a point. Coats and raincoats hung on one wall of the hall; shelving covered the other side. On the wall beside the door was a small faucet with a short hose attached, hanging over a drain. Her parents had something similar, a place to rinse footwear. She wiped off her rubber boots and walked into the living room, where Big Thomsen was yelling.</p>
         <p id="p1683">“I slept with my girlfriend last night. Can’t you get that through your head? I was there all night—just ask her!”</p>
         <p id="p1684">Eik nodded calmly as Louise began a systematic search of the house. A large, black leather corner sofa had been pushed into the nook beside the porch door. Pictures hung on the walls, and on the buffet sat a large glass plate. A very expensive plate, Louise thought. This was no bachelor pad; she’d expected to see a billiard table or a dartboard. The kitchen had a large refrigerator with a freezer compartment below, an ice cube dispenser above. She checked the bedroom with attached bath, the two guest rooms on the other side of the hall. Still no boy. And the bedspreads were smooth, everything appeared to be in its place, with no sign of anyone having been there recently.</p>
         <p id="p1685">Louise peeked into Thomsen’s bedroom. A framed photo of his parents stood on a chest of drawers. His father was as she remembered him, back when he was police chief of Roskilde. They’d called his mother Mrs. Police Chief. Louise knew her as the woman behind the counter at the bank, long before Unibank became Nordea.</p>
         <p id="p1686">Strange how these small flashes of memory popped up, she thought, as she looked at a photo of Ole Thomsen as a schoolboy. Broad face, thick hair, with happy eyes and a light smile. His arm was around a young girl. Louise had forgotten that he’d been good looking back then.</p>
         <p id="p1687">Right after they’d moved to Lerbjerg, when she started at Hvalsø School, he was one of the boys she watched during recesses. She couldn’t remember when his charm had disappeared, when whatever he was now had taken over.</p>
         <p id="p1688">“Fine, we’ll all go see her,” she heard Eik say from the living room. Someone began walking. “Stop right there,” Eik shouted. “Hand over your phone. No calls until we’ve spoken with Bitten Gamst.”</p>
         <p id="p1689">Louise stood out in the hall and waited while they put their shoes on. Then she glanced into his office behind the kitchen.</p>
         <p id="p1690">“I’ll take a look in the attic,” she told Eik as they were about to walk out. Stairs in the laundry room led up to a whitewashed trapdoor in the ceiling. She pushed it open and found a light switch on the floor beside the chimney.</p>
         <p id="p1691">Several packing boxes and a Christmas tree holder were stacked up close to the door. She stepped inside, the attic floor sagging a bit from her weight. Dust swirled; dark shadows lined the walls. Things, stored and forgotten. There was no sound, no sign of life. Louise shone her flashlight in the corners. Nothing.</p>
         <p id="p1692">Eik had started the car outside; she heard the diesel purring. She shut off the light, lowered the trapdoor onto her head, and crawled down the steps.</p>
         <p id="p1693">She glanced around the living room one last time before walking out and getting into the backseat. She sensed Thomsen looking at her in the side mirror. Their eyes met for a moment, then she jerked her head away, leaving him to stare at her profile.</p>
