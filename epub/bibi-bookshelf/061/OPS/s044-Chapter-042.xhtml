         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1889"><span class="dropcap-rw">C</span>ars were parked everywhere. She heard Eik mumbling each time he thought he’d spotted an empty parking space, but when he got close there was always a tiny car tucked in between two behemoths.</p>
         <p id="p1890">Many years had passed since Louise had been in the city park to hear music, but now it all came back to her. How she had sat with friends on the slope, drinking beer. She would meet someone up at the ice cream store, and after sitting down on the grass they would keep looking around to find others they knew. Mostly she had looked for Klaus. That was before they became a couple.</p>
         <p id="p1891">“Did the boys say where to pick them up?” Eik asked.</p>
         <p id="p1892">Louise noticed they were in a taxi lane. “You can’t park here!”</p>
         <p id="p1893">“I can’t park anywhere else, either, so I’m parking here.”</p>
         <p id="p1894">Louise tried to call Jonas again. She sighed in irritation when again he didn’t answer, but then Eik saw them walking up the gravel path, surrounded by laughing girls with long, flowing hair.</p>
         <p id="p1895">They were so big now! Fifteen years old, almost sixteen. For a moment she just sat and stared, as if it had happened while she wasn’t looking. Markus did the talking; he was making everyone laugh. When he turned to say something, Louise suddenly noticed that Jonas was holding hands with one of the pretty girls. His long, dark hair was combed off his forehead. No more hiding behind a curtain, it seemed. His big smile transformed his face.</p>
         <p id="p1896">A warm feeling spread inside Louise, and she sat a moment longer and enjoyed it before opening the car door and calling to them.</p>
         <p id="p1897">The two big teenage boys took their time hugging all the girls good-bye. Seconds later, on the way to the car, they were already talking, laughing about something Louise couldn’t hear.</p>
         <p id="p1898">Louise missed that life. At least in a way. She could have been the girl getting the hug, and the moment the boy turned away he would move on to the next thing in his life. While she might spend the next several days turning over in her mind what the hug meant.</p>
         <p id="p1899">She missed those days, yet she was glad they were over. But it was good for Jonas; it had been a long time since he’d seemed so happy. Now there was something carefree in his expression. Louise felt at peace. Maybe he hadn’t been scarred for life after all, from all the traumatic experiences he’d gone through. She asked them if they’d eaten, though it was past ten now.</p>
         <p id="p1900">Jonas didn’t have to be in school until late the next morning, so they decided to stay at Camilla’s and drive back early. Melvin was keeping Dina; there was nothing pressing they had to return home for.</p>

         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1902">“What the hell?” Markus shouted from the backseat as they drove up the long driveway to Ingersminde. Eik slowed down and they all leaned forward.</p>
         <p id="p1903">At the entrance to the courtyard, a gigantic log lay blocking the road. Several men in helmets walked around carrying ropes. The boys jumped out and ran toward the house.</p>
         <p id="p1904">“Watch out!” Louise yelled after them.</p>
         <p id="p1905">Eik backed up and parked off to the side. A chain saw buzzed, and male voices rose up from the din. Several cars lined the driveway. The air smelled of wood, of a sawmill. Something felt terribly wrong about all this activity, so close to nightfall.</p>
         <p id="p1906">“They cut down the warden tree,” Jonas yelled when they reached the courtyard. “Frederik decided to do it. He’s standing over there. They’re cutting up the trunk to haul it away.”</p>
         <p id="p1907">He sounded like a reporter broadcasting live from some important event.</p>
         <p id="p1908">Louise took Eik’s hand and followed him to the tree, where the men were shouting instructions at each other. For a second they eyed the enormous trunk of the oak, which stuck several meters in the air. The lowest limbs were to their right, everything else blurred out in the twilight.</p>
         <div class="decoration-rw" id="decoration25">

         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1910">Camilla was in the living room with her laptop when Eik and Louise entered the house.</p>
         <p id="p1911">“Get in here and look!” she called out when she heard them.</p>
         <p id="p1912">She explained about the warden tree being vandalized and Frederik’s decision to fell it, to demonstrate that he wouldn’t be intimidated by threats. She handed them her phone and showed them the photo of what had been carved into the tree trunk.</p>
         <p id="p1913">“I think it’s this rune,” she said. She turned the laptop around so they could see the screen.</p>
         <p id="p1914">Louise enlarged the photo on the phone and studied the circle and cross with the small markings. Eik leaned over her shoulder. “Ragnarok,” he said, after a single glance. “The rune symbolizes Ragnarok. Someone’s trying to tell you something.”</p>
         <p id="p1915">“Yeah, and you know what?” Camilla snapped. “This someone needs to shut up and get the hell out of our lives. They think they can walk right on our property, try to scare us with all their Asa shit, but we’re not going to stand for it. That poor boy almost died out in our forest. And the graves of the girls, what the hell is going on?”</p>
         <p id="p1916">She turned to Louise. “Did you find out if it’s all connected?”</p>
         <p id="p1917">“It seems to be.” She told Camilla that Thomsen and his gang were to be arrested that evening. “It’s probably already done. Which means Nymand and his people have twenty-four hours to collect enough evidence to present to a judge. Hopefully they’ll be remanded into custody.”</p>
         <p id="p1918">Right now she wasn’t concerned with that case. It was out of her hands. Sune had survived, and he was reunited with his parents. She had informed Rønholt that she was taking the next day off, and when she’d had time to distance herself from all this, she was sure the investigation into Klaus’s death by Roskilde Police would give her peace of mind.</p>
         <p id="p1919">She was free of the guilt she’d been carrying around for years. Knowing Big Thomsen and the others would be brought to justice for all they had done over the years gave her a sense of satisfaction. Her work did make a difference.</p>
         <p id="p1920">She stood and asked if it was okay to grab a beer in the refrigerator. She wanted to sit on the terrace and look out over the fjord. Let the day settle inside her. She dragged Eik along with her.</p>
