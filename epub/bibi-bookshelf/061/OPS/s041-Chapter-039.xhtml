A month, maybe two. At the end she was really sick; she just lay in her room and felt like hell. But she made a fight of it. It was strange for all of us who knew her; she’d been a real ball of fire. And there she was, wasting away from all that AIDS shit.” He looked up at Louise. “You know Roed Thomsen. He couldn’t handle his daughter having AIDS. Nobody talked about it. It was like they were ashamed, but it sure as hell wasn’t her fault.”</p>
         <p id="p1788">Louise knew exactly what he was talking about. Some people had panicked. They’d thought you could get the disease by kissing or drinking out of the same glass. It wasn’t hard to imagine that this locally well-known Hvalsø family had gone into denial about what the poor girl suffered from.</p>
         <p id="p1789">“You may not believe Thomsen can be sensitive, but he was just totally wiped out by all this. He was the one who’d taken her up in the tree. He adored his little sister; he’d have done anything to make her well. I can’t remember exactly when he called us all together. His folks were over on Fyn or in Jutland, visiting friends, staying overnight. Eline had asked him to drive her out to the sacrificial oak, so we could call upon the gods to take care of her. In a lot of ways it was really tough, but we didn’t think so much about it back then. The important thing was to support Eline, or maybe to feel we meant something to her.”</p>
         <p id="p1790">Louise leaned forward. “What gave her the idea?”</p>
         <p id="p1791">“Thomsen’s grandmother grew up at the old girls’ orphanage. Eline heard the stories about the girls about to die being taken out to the tree, to make sure the gods were ready to receive them. The stories made an impression on her. She wanted the same for herself.”</p>
         <p id="p1792">“I wonder, is it because of his grandmother’s childhood that Thomsen is Asatro, and did he pressure the rest of you to join?”</p>
         <p id="p1793">“He didn’t pressure nobody,” the butcher said, irritated at the question. “You become an Asatro because it gives meaning to your life, being one with nature. For Scandinavians it’s the most obvious faith there is.”</p>
         <p id="p1794">His aggressive outburst told Louise that he was used to defending himself. “All right. But how did it begin?”</p>
         <p id="p1795">“Like I said, his grandmother grew up with the faith at the orphanage. The director was a gothi. That’s what we call our priest. A lot from the old Nordic myths takes place right here in Lejre and Roskilde. It’s a part of the region’s history, and now we’ve made it a part of our lives.”</p>
         <p id="p1796">Louise nodded. She thought about Sune, only fifteen years old, yet these men had tried to force him into their brotherhood. The poor kid. The more his father talked about it, the more it sounded like a sect, however much they made it out to be a faith.</p>
         <p id="p1797">The butcher shifted in his chair. “I’ve never told this to anyone, but I guess there’s no reason not to anymore.” He looked first at Eik, then at Louise. “You know anything at all about the sacrificial oak in Boserup Forest?”</p>
         <p id="p1798">He looked surprised when they both nodded. “Anyway, it was a full moon the night we drove Eline into the forest. It was a coincidence, it wasn’t like it was something Thomsen could control. But it made the mood special. She wasn’t strong enough to walk, so we carried her. There was a lot more undergrowth back then. We hadn’t cleared off our bonfire area, either. Eline thought the moonlight looked like silver that fell from the sky. We put blankets out on the ground and built a small campfire.”</p>
         <p id="p1799">Louise couldn’t make herself ask if Klaus had been there.</p>
         <p id="p1800">“So she just sat there with her back against the tree, in the campfire’s light, wrapped up in her white comforter. We sat in a circle around her and called upon the gods.”</p>
         <p id="p1801">His voice was gentler now. It sounded a few shades darker, as if the memory was fresh enough for him to remember the mood.</p>
         <p id="p1802">“Something very special happens when you’re in harmony with nature. When you stand in a circle with the heat from the campfire, the light of the moon, the stillness of the forest, you can feel the force of the gods. You feel their presence, spiritually and physically. You get the very strong feeling you’re not alone. It’s very peaceful.”</p>
         <p id="p1803">He looked at them hesitantly, as if he’d just exposed himself and was waiting to see how they’d react.</p>
         <p id="p1804">“I know, you’re right,” Eik said. “I’ve been at a winter solstice celebration. It’s a really special feeling.”</p>
         <p id="p1805">Louise looked at him but chose to not say anything.</p>
         <p id="p1806">“None of us had discovered it yet,” the butcher said. “Not until we opened up the circle to give Eline some cola to drink, and to sit for a while and enjoy it while the fire burned down.”</p>
         <p id="p1807">“Discovered what?” Louise said.</p>
         <p id="p1808">“That she was bleeding.”</p>
         <p id="p1809">He rubbed his nose and had difficulty continuing. “She’d brought along a pocketknife. She’d cut herself around her elbow—deep cuts—the blood was streaming down on the ground.”</p>
         <p id="p1810">Louise felt a chill; she remembered what Camilla had told her about Sune.</p>
         <p id="p1811">“Thomsen flipped out, he tried to stop the bleeding. He tried to bind her arm, but she kept taking it off, and at last he left her alone.”</p>
         <p id="p1812">Louise could almost sense how it must have felt that night in the forest.</p>
         <p id="p1813">“I don’t know what she and Thomsen talked about, and I never worked up the courage to ask.”</p>
         <p id="p1814">“And she died?” Eik asked.</p>
         <p id="p1815">The butcher shook his head. “Yes and no. She didn’t die right off. She died later at home that night.” For several moments they took in what they had just heard. Then he leaned over with his forearms resting on his thighs, his hands together.</p>
         <p id="p1816">“How did Thomsen explain this to his parents?” Louise asked. She could almost hear the old police chief’s voice as the butcher told them what happened.</p>
         <p id="p1817">“His father wouldn’t listen when he said it was Eline’s doing, or that we couldn’t prevent it. He didn’t believe Thomsen had tried to stop the bleeding, either. He never accused us of killing her, but we knew he blamed his son for her death.”</p>
         <p id="p1818">He bit his lip. “In a way it was his fault, of course. Our fault. We should never have taken her out to the forest when she was dying.”</p>
         <p id="p1819">He spoke quietly after a long pause. “Eline chose to take her own life, and we helped her.”</p>
         <p id="p1820">Eik broke the difficult silence that followed. “But I don’t understand how she ended up in one of the old graves of the girls.”</p>
         <p id="p1821">The butcher squirmed. Louise could hardly stand to look at him. He was allowing them access to what lay deepest inside, down where it was truly gruesome. “The police chief didn’t want it to be said that his little girl had committed suicide. As if he hadn’t been able to take care of her, or hadn’t loved her enough.”</p>
         <p id="p1822">“Why is this something no one talks about?” Louise said. “Why don’t I know anything about this story?”</p>
         <p id="p1823">“Because no one wanted it to come out. She was reported missing, and that was that. The police chief took care of it somehow; I don’t know how. No one dared to ask. Everyone was scared of getting on the wrong side of Roed Thomsen.”</p>
         <p id="p1824">“And then he buried her out in the forest?” Louise said.</p>
         <p id="p1825">He shook his head. “<i>We</i> buried her. He kept out of it. I mean, think of what it would have looked like if he’d somehow been involved with his own daughter’s death?”</p>
         <p id="p1826">“And then…?” Eik said.</p>
         <p id="p1827">“And then we passed the oath ring around. We’d all been Asatro for quite a while, but this was when we formed a brotherhood and took an oath of silence. Klaus did, too.”</p>
         <p id="p1828">He looked at Louise, but immediately she realized she didn’t want to know more.</p>
         <p id="p1829">“We promised each other to never say anything about it, and we swore to be each other’s brothers, no matter what.”</p>
         <p id="p1830">Suddenly he seemed drained; in despair. “I’ve failed Sune. I’ve never been strong enough to break free of what went on back then. I’ve been a shitty father. The brotherhood with Thomsen and the others has always been more important than my family, and it’s my fault anyway that they punished him. I should never have pushed him into it.”</p>
         <p id="p1831"><i>It’s a little late for that</i>, Louise thought.</p>
         <p id="p1832">He was clearly tired now. His forehead furrowed.</p>
         <p id="p1833">“You do know you’ll have to tell Roskilde Police what you’ve told us, don’t you?” Louise said.</p>
         <p id="p1834">He’d nodded even before Louise had finished speaking. Apparently he’d already realized that, which was a relief to Louise.</p>
         <p id="p1835">“Of course. I know I’ve kept my mouth shut way too long. That’s over with.”</p>
