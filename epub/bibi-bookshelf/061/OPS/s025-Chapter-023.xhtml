         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1099"><span class="dropcap-rw">T</span>hey found her. They found her! Sune felt as if he were about to explode.</p>
         <p id="p1100">The last few days he had watched the police cars from his hiding place; he’d heard their dogs, listened to them yelling. They had dug all over, and the earth from several of the old orphanage graves lay in uneven, coal-black mounds.</p>
         <p id="p1101">He’d stood hidden among the trees as two men in white coveralls unfolded a body bag. Even at a distance, he recognized her long, blond hair when they laid her in and zipped it up. They’d carried her back to the car with the tinted windows.</p>
         <p id="p1102">Now the police were finally gone, and he scampered back across the forest floor, away from the clearing and the dug-up graves. His heart hammered, and he felt dizzy from blood rushing through his temples. He’d been right all along. Deep inside he had hoped that he’d imagined it all, that he had been scared for no reason. But he’d seen her in the light of the bonfire, lying on the ground, so still.</p>
         <p id="p1103">The moon’s pale light cast ghostly shadows around Sune, but he wasn’t afraid of trees or dark forests. Nothing in nature unsettled him. It was all the other things.</p>
         <p id="p1104">He stopped to catch his breath, but he whirled around when he heard limbs cracking behind him, then the sound of heavy footsteps. He hadn’t been paying attention, and he was about to run when he recognized his father’s voice in the darkness.</p>
         <p id="p1105">“Wait! You have to listen to me. Your mother wants to see you!”</p>
         <p id="p1106">Thoughts flew through his head. His desperate flight. Punishment, the oath ring. His legs wanted to run, but his craving to see his mother stopped them. His heart beat so loudly that it would have scared the forest birds away if they hadn’t already gone to roost. Now he and his father were alone.</p>
         <p id="p1107">“Sune.” His father approached him with open arms; it felt like a magnet to Sune, yet he kept his distance. His father’s arms sank.</p>
         <p id="p1108">“The police came by asking about you. I had a tough time figuring out what to say. People think you’ve taken your life. They’re talking about you.”</p>
         <p id="p1109">Sune didn’t know what to say, either. He wanted this to end. His father seemed completely different from the night he had hissed in Sune’s ear to pull himself together; to not shame him.</p>
         <p id="p1110">“Your mother’s doing badly, and she’s terribly upset. Come home for her sake, and we can work everything else out. You’re a grown boy now—you have responsibilities.”</p>
         <p id="p1111">“I’m not coming home,” he whispered, unable to control his voice.</p>
         <p id="p1112">“You have to. I can’t take care of you out here.”</p>
         <p id="p1113">“I can take care of myself,” Sune said, more self-assured now.</p>
         <p id="p1114">“Not anymore you can’t. It’s too dangerous. Come home with me, and swear on the oath ring. You’re born into this; there’s nothing to do about it.”</p>
         <p id="p1115">For a moment they stood in the clear moonlight, staring at each other. Then Sune shook his head; he realized what his father was after, and it had nothing to do with his mom.</p>
         <p id="p1116">“I’m trying to help you. You’re one of us; we’ll take care of you.”</p>
         <p id="p1117">Sune could almost see the bonds of the Asatro his father wanted to bind him with. They tightened, cutting into him, snarling like the worm that wrapped itself around Midgård and bit its own tail. But then his father’s shoulders seemed to sink again as his expression loosened. He sighed.</p>
         <p id="p1118">“Don’t decide right now. Why don’t I come back tomorrow? But I have to tell you that if you still say no, you’re on your own. Completely. Like a child who hasn’t been knee-sat.”</p>
         <p id="p1119">Sune understood what that meant. A baby who hasn’t been knee-sat belongs to no one. It could be abandoned to the wolves if the parents felt unable to take care of it. Sune had been knee-sat at the ceremony where he was given his name and his parents had officially accepted him. He’d been very young back then; he didn’t remember. But no one had told him that the acceptance could be revoked.</p>
         <p id="p1120">“Tomorrow evening after sunset at the sacrificial oak,” his father said. “I’m holding the door open for you, but if you don’t come in I can’t protect you any longer.”</p>
         <p id="p1121">He turned and left.</p>
