         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2202"><span class="dropcap-rw">W</span>e have to bring his bike,” Louise reminded Eik as he walked onto the sidewalk with two huge IKEA bags filled with linens and towels. Jonas was leaving for boarding school; they were packing the car with all his stuff.</p>
         <p id="p2203">“We can strap it to the roof,” Eik said, energetically, heading back toward the basement door to pick it up.</p>
         <p id="p2204">Louise heard Jonas rumbling down the stairs inside. Leaning against Eik’s massive monstrosity of a vehicle, she closed her eyes and exhaled. The past month had flown away. After the kidnapping and the shocking experience in the woods, she’d feared that Jonas had been damaged to an extent that could lead to a trauma. But she’d been wrong. What became clear from the very first interview with the crisis psychologist was that what really mattered to her son was that she and Eik had reached him in time. Before everything went really wrong. Jonas found great comfort in the fact that they had found him; that was what he focused on. Fortunately, he didn’t fully understand how close he had been to actually being killed.</p>
         <p id="p2205">It was Jonas who had asked if he could go to boarding school with Markus. Louise had seen it as a healthy sign that he had the courage to embark on new challenges and new environments despite what he’d been through, so she immediately approved, agreeing that it was a good idea. Even if it meant that he’d be away for so long.</p>
         <div class="decoration-rw" id="decoration31">

         </div>
         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2207">After Ingersminde burned down, Camilla and Frederik had accepted the offer to stay in Eik’s tiny and cramped one-bedroom apartment in Sydhavnen while they tried to figure out their future. They’d lost everything in the fire; the only belongings they had left were the clothes they were wearing when Frederik was rushed to the hospital.</p>
         <p id="p2208">Markus had found the school in Odsherred all by himself, and Louise couldn’t quite figure out whether it was because he couldn’t handle having to live in such close quarters with his mother and Frederik in the small apartment, or if it was an urge to put everything that had transpired behind him. But over the summer holidays both boys were excited and looking forward eagerly to everything new that lay ahead. Which made Louise feel comfortable about her own decision to let Jonas go. Luckily the school had room for both of them. They’d already met with the other students in the group they were assigned to at the school, which helped to alleviate that uncertainty and nervousness that accompanied embarking upon something new.</p>
         <p id="p2209">“I forgot my sneakers,” Jonas said, throwing his big weekend bag on the pavement and turning around to run back up to the fourth floor. “What about your toiletries?” Louise shouted after him. Eik leaned the bike against the car and walked over; he wrapped his arms around her.</p>
         <p id="p2210">“Are you okay?” he whispered, pulling her close.</p>
         <p id="p2211">“Yes,” she muttered. “But he’ll be gone for a whole year. It’s going to be so empty here not having him home.”</p>
         <p id="p2212">“He’ll visit every weekend,” Eik reassured. “And truthfully, empty is not exactly what it will be. It sounds like you’ve forgotten that I’ve moved in. And, of course, there’s Dina and Charlie.”</p>
         <p id="p2213">Louise knew that the students didn’t go home over the first weekend; it would be two weeks until she’d get to see Jonas again. She pushed herself gently out of Eik’s arms and smiled at him. “If there is one thing I cannot forget, it’s your leather jacket lying around everywhere. Not to mention that your dog eats ten kilograms of dry food every week.”</p>
         <p id="p2214">Just then Dina, whose smarts and expert sense of smell likely combined to get her safely out of the fire, and Charlie, with their tails wagging, came running playfully out of the front door, with Jonas right behind them. “C’mon, let’s go,” Jonas said as Eik finished attaching his bike to the roof of the car. Louise noticed the expectant tone in her son’s voice.</p>
         <p id="p2215">Three hours later they were heading back to Copenhagen. Jonas had immediately connected with a few of the other boys who would be living in his dorm section. He was so caught up, Louise had noticed, that he had to squeeze in a quick good-bye with his mother and Eik.</p>
         <p id="p2216">The landscape expanded and contracted. Forests were replaced by grassy open areas and gentle hilly terrain; the fields looked ready for harvesting. In the backseat both dogs were snoring, as if in harmony. Of course, Louise would miss having Jonas around, but seeing him with the other kids at school was amazing and heartwarming. It was so clear he was looking toward his future, and excited about embarking upon his next chapter. She was genuinely happy for him, but not completely certain she was equally ready to see him move on and away from her. It was only natural, though; she’d have to adjust.</p>
         <p id="p2217">Feeling drowsy, Louise leaned her head sleepily against the passenger window, closing her eyes. She had never really <i>lived</i> with a man. But now circumstances had overtaken Eik’s life—he had turned over his own apartment to Camilla and Frederik in their time of need. It had all happened as if by chance. But for Louise, embracing the possibilities and floating with the stream, though a bit scary, just felt right. <i>Yes</i>, she thought, she was ready for this. Something had finally fallen into place inside her.</p>
         <p id="p2218">Louise opened her eyes and looked at Eik as he drove, humming and focused. She was no longer alone.</p>
