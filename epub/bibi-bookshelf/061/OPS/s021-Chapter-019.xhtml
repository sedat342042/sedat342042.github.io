         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p894"><span class="dropcap-rw">T</span>hey sat for a while, no one saying a word, absorbing the history of the place.</p>
         <p id="p895">“Can we find the spot where the girls are buried?” Eik asked. He stood up. “The dogs need to get out, and who knows, I might be lucky enough to meet the girl who didn’t die. You want to come?”</p>
         <p id="p896">He held his hand out to Louise.</p>
         <p id="p897">“What about food?” she asked them. “I can drive into Roskilde and do some shopping. Will it be too late if we take a walk first?”</p>
         <p id="p898">It was almost eight.</p>
         <p id="p899">“We’ll take care of dinner while you’re gone,” Frederik said. “I’ll get the boys to make a salad, and I’ll light the grill.”</p>
         <p id="p900">He found a map and spread it out. “The Death Trail enters the forest here, but the part of the trail close to our house is overgrown with weeds and bushes. It’s probably easier for you to find the graves from the sacrificial oak.”</p>
         <p id="p901">He picked up a red felt pen and marked the route for them on the map. He drew a circle. “There’s a clearing here. The Asatro’s bonfire site is in the middle, but if you walk behind the tree you’ll find the Death Trail. Just follow it to the graves. It’ll take about ten minutes.”</p>
         <p id="p902">“Sounds good,” Louise said. “We’ll find it.”</p>
         <p id="p903">Eik stood outside with the two dogs, who were jumping around when she came out. Louise smiled when the retired police dog rocketed off, as if he’d completely forgotten that one of his back legs didn’t work. The German shepherd was as friendly as he could be now that he was out of the office, which he considered his territory to guard. He hadn’t growled or bared his teeth at Camilla, Frederik, or Markus, and it had been love at first sight with Jonas and Dina.</p>

         </div>
         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p905">They strolled toward the old oak. Louise enjoyed holding Eik’s warm hand, the way he held her fingers and stroked her hand with his thumb. The peaceful forest, the sunlight and sound of the dogs running ahead, all so beautiful and quiet. Once in a while they stopped and kissed, and she rested her chin against his leather jacket as he held her. Louise wanted to melt away into the moment.</p>
         <p id="p906">It wasn’t difficult to find the sacrificial oak or the narrow path. Louise let go of Eik’s hand and leaned her head back to take a good look at the old oak. The trunk was so large that they couldn’t have reached around it even if Camilla and Frederik had come along.</p>
         <p id="p907">“If you’ve got any aches or pains, you should crawl into the hole,” Eik said. He pointed to the trunk. “These old trees can heal you, and they also say that the old hollow trees can improve a woman’s fertility if she’s having trouble getting pregnant.”</p>
         <p id="p908">“I’m not getting into any tree,” she said. She started toward the path. “Where’d you hear about that?”</p>
         <p id="p909">He let go of her hand when they reached the path. “Those things interested me when I was a kid.”</p>
         <p id="p910">Why did that not surprise her?</p>
         <p id="p911">Eik held a limb back, but twigs caught and pulled at Camilla’s hair as she fought through the underbrush covering the two wheel ruts of the trail.</p>
         <p id="p912">“Let me lead the way,” he said. He tromped through to make a path.</p>
         <p id="p913">The dogs were already far ahead. The thick underbrush closed behind them, as if they had been swallowed.</p>
         <p id="p914">Suddenly a clearing appeared. A gnarled tree stood in the middle, its crown spread out like a toadstool. The sun was hidden behind the forest, but the evening light cast a red sheen over everything. A low hedge grew on all four sides around the tree, making it look as if it were in the middle of a playing field.</p>
         <p id="p915">The identical graves lay behind the unkempt hedge. They were spaced two to three meters apart. Simple and chilling. Louise froze; she felt as if she’d stepped into a world where time stood still. She began walking slowly toward Eik, who had crouched down at the first gravestone.</p>
         <p id="p916">“Ellen Sofie Mathilde Jensen,” Eik read. “Born 1908, died 1920. Twelve years old, she was.”</p>
         <p id="p917">Louise walked down the row of graves, reading the names and dates chiseled into the gravestones. All the girls were very young when they died, none of them over sixteen. The hairs on her arms rose, and she shook her head at herself. Then she heard Dina whining eagerly, and Charlie barked. She was familiar enough with police dogs to know that he was marking territory, and she was about to ask Eik to call him when Dina also began barking. Annoyed now, she walked over. The German shepherd was digging, growling to warn Dina away.</p>
         <p id="p918">“Eik, damn it!” She’d already pulled a dog leash out of her pocket to hold the deaf Labrador.</p>
         <p id="p919">“What did he find?” Eik asked. He’d taken the other way around the graves.</p>
         <p id="p920">“I don’t know, but I do know that there are forty-two hundred-year-old corpses here, so if that’s what he’s after, there’s more than enough for him.” Louise grabbed Dina while Eik ordered Charlie to stay. “Is he hurt so bad that you can’t take him to a graveyard without him flipping out?”</p>
         <p id="p921">“Of course not. He was a Grade One dog; only the best reach that level.” Eik sounded insulted. He was about to say more, but then he stopped. “What the hell!”</p>
         <p id="p922">He dropped to his knees and began scraping the compact soil aside.</p>
         <p id="p923">Louise tied Dina to a tree. “What did he find?” she yelled, running over to him.</p>
         <p id="p924">“A body.”</p>
         <p id="p925">Charlie had dug a small trench, and now he lay beside it and looked at them attentively.</p>
         <p id="p926">Eik’s voice was dark—the warmth that she had heard before had vanished. Carefully he pushed a bit more of the dirt aside. “This is no child’s hand,” he said, “and it hasn’t been here a hundred years.”</p>
         <p id="p927">Louise felt a chill. Eik had uncovered a pale white hand. From the swollen tissue and waxy film over the skin, she knew it was utterly impossible that it been buried since the early 1900s.</p>
         <p id="p928">Her heart hammered as she squatted beside him. Eik scraped a bit more earth away to reveal the arm. The corpse wasn’t fresh; several places showed only bone and sinew.</p>
         <p id="p929">She looked at the gravestone. “Klara Sofie Erna Hermansen. Born 1916, died 1918.”</p>
         <p id="p930">They sat there for a moment. Louise leaned against Eik’s knee as she studied the skin left on the upper arm. She was about to stand up when he grabbed her and pointed. He swiped more of the dirt away, and she saw that some of the fingers were intact. A gold ring, much too big, adorned one of them.</p>
         <p id="p931">“Female?” he guessed. He stood and wiped his hands on his pants. “Or a teenager. Not a grown man, anyway.”</p>
         <p id="p932">“It’s hard to say,” Louise answered as she rose up from her knees. “It may have been lying here a long time. The clothes are almost rotted away.”</p>
         <p id="p933">Dark scraps of material were scattered around the ground, as if a sleeve had slowly deteriorated.</p>
         <p id="p934">“My guess is five, maybe ten years,” Eik said. He walked off to smoke a cigarette, while Louise found Frederik’s number on her phone. “The grave is shallow.”</p>
         <p id="p935">“I don’t think it’s a grave,” she said. She measured the distance from the body to the top of the ground. “Someone has tried to hide a body.”</p>
         <div class="decoration-rw" id="decoration12">
            <p class="center-rw" id="p936">*  *  *</p>
         </div>
         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p937">“Couldn’t you find it?” Frederik asked when Louise called.</p>
         <p id="p938">“We found it, all right,” Louise said. She didn’t know how to begin. “We found a body out here that’s not from the girls’ orphanage.”</p>
         <p id="p939">After several seconds Frederik asked, “What do you mean?”</p>
         <p id="p940">“It looks like someone has been buried on top of one of the old graves.”</p>
         <p id="p941">She told him about Charlie sniffing it out. “The body is about half a meter down, far enough so the animals haven’t dug it up.”</p>
         <p id="p942">“Couldn’t it be an animal?”</p>
         <p id="p943">She could hear he was shaken. “No, it’s human, no doubt about that.” She said the Roskilde Police would definitely want to speak with him.</p>
         <p id="p944">“I’d better come right now,” he said.</p>
         <p id="p945">Louise heard gravel crunching; he was already on his way. “Can you make sure the police have someplace to enter the forest? And there’s no reason to tell Jonas and Markus about this until tomorrow morning, let’s not get them all excited tonight.”</p>
         <p id="p946">Frederik agreed, and he promised to have Tønnesen take down the chain blocking the road.</p>
         <p id="p947">“Tell the police to drive in at the forest parking lot and I’ll meet them. But won’t they want to wait until tomorrow, when they can see?”</p>
         <p id="p948">“They’ll definitely come immediately,” Louise said, nodding at Eik, who was signaling to her that he’d call Mid- and West Zealand Police in Roskilde. Meanwhile she explained to Frederik that a team of technicians would come in addition to the police, even though it was already getting dark.</p>
         <p id="p949">“They’ll probably have the Emergency Management Agency put a tent over the grave, then they’ll set up floodlights,” Louise said, adding that of course a forensic pathologist would be there to look at the body before it was carefully dug up and taken in to be examined.</p>
         <div class="decoration-rw" id="decoration13">
            <p class="center-rw" id="p950">*  *  *</p>
         </div>
         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p951">Ten minutes later Frederik trotted out of the forest. He stopped for a moment to get his bearings in the near-darkness of the summer night, then hurried over to them.</p>
         <p id="p952">Louise tried to stop him in time, but he got close enough to see the arm sticking out of the ground.</p>
         <p id="p953">“My God!” He stared at the ground, his hand over his mouth. He shook his head. “How could something like this happen?”</p>
         <p id="p954">He seemed uncertain of where to go. “Who would do something like this? Hiding a body in our forest?”</p>
         <p id="p955">He backed off a bit, still staring at the arm in the ground.</p>
         <p id="p956"><i>You’d be surprised at the things people can do</i>, Louise thought, but she didn’t say it. He was shaken up enough already.</p>
         <p id="p957">“That’s probably one of the things the police will ask you,” she said. “Is the forest open to the public?”</p>
         <p id="p958">Frederik nodded. Finally he tore his eyes away. “It’s a private forest, and we have <span class="smallcaps-rw" style="font-size: 82%;">NO VEHICLES ALLOWED</span> signs up, but we’ve just seen that some people ignore them.”</p>
         <p id="p959">Eik’s phone rang. He nodded crisply at Frederik. “They’ll be here soon. You’ll show them the way?” He walked off to take the call.</p>
         <p id="p960">When Frederik left, Eik came back and put his arm around Louise’s shoulder. “We better take the dogs back, so they don’t cause so much commotion when the police arrive.”</p>
         <p id="p961">She’d untied Dina from the tree and was now holding her leash, but it seemed as if the yellow Lab had lost interest in the corpse. Charlie still lay where Eik had left him. The big German shepherd didn’t budge, even though Dina egged him on to play.</p>
         <p id="p962">Louise shook herself. In a few minutes the evening quiet of the forest would be transformed into a crime scene, and all the relevant investigations would begin. More people would show up, and the floodlights would blaze coldly down onto the old graves of the girls. She thought about the boy hiding somewhere out there. Maybe he’d left the area, but if not, the lights might flush him out. Or frighten him to death.</p>
