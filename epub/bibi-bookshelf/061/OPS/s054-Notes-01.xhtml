         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2219"><i>The Killing Forest</i> is fiction. I grew up just outside Hvalsø; I love the area, and so it has been a joy to return to these familiar surroundings. I have, however, taken the liberty of both creating and relocating settings to fit my story. Ingersminde, for example, doesn’t exist, the graves of the girls were inspired by a visit to Jægerspris Castle, and the sacrificial oak is located in another part of Zealand.</p>
         <p id="p2220">My story is based partly on old legends and tales, but most of it is a product of my imagination; in turn, neither the characters nor their names are based on actual people. Any likeness is therefore coincidental, though I have to admit that the stories about Louise Rick’s father bear a striking resemblance to my own father’s experiences as a non-native, big-city Copenhagen slicker.</p>
         <p id="p2221">Once again, many people have been generous with their time and energy in helping me research the book. A special thanks goes out to Jim Lyngvild, who taught me about Asatro. He answered many questions and showed a willingness to help, even though some of the characters in the book who share his beliefs are extremists. I have so enjoyed brushing up on my knowledge of Norse mythology and the old legends and myths.</p>
         <p id="p2222">I very much appreciate the fine people who attended my speech in Hvalsø and ended up sharing several fantastical legends and myths. Hell’s Cauldron and the great pike would never have been part of the book without you all.</p>
         <p id="p2223">A special thanks also to pathologist Steen Holger Hansen and to Bo Greibe, a former dog handler at the Danish police.</p>
         <p id="p2224">Thanks to my Danish editor, Lisbeth Møller-Madsen, to my Danish publisher, People’sPress, and to my Scandinavian agent, Trine Busch, for her wholehearted support of me and Louise Rick.</p>
         <p id="p2225">Thanks to my American editor, Mitch Hoffman, to Caitlin Mulrooney-Lyski, and to the whole team at Grand Central Publishing. You’re amazing.</p>
         <p id="p2226">Thanks to Benee Knauer, for being my book godmother, and to the fantastic people at Victoria Sanders &amp; Associates: Victoria Sanders, Bernadette Baker-Baughman, Chris Kepner, and Tony Gabriel. It is a great pleasure to be working with you all!</p>
         <p id="p2227">All my love and appreciation goes out to my wonderful son, Adam. You are my very best.</p>
