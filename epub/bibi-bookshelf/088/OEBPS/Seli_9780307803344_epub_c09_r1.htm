<h1 class="chapter" id="c09"><a id="page155"/>9<br/><em>Sports</em></h1>
<p class="nonindent">I <span class="small">CAN’T ABIDE</span> the eleven o’clock news. It’s not just the fact that models read the stuff. It’s what they read and the film clips they show. A fire in North Philadelphia was the big story last night. I was treated to thirty seconds of flames shooting out of windows, one minute of interviews with the survivors, who were mostly bewailing their lost possessions, and one minute with the sobbing wife of a fireman overcome by smoke inhalation. Don’t misunderstand: It was a tragic event and deserved some coverage. But the producers of the eleven o’clock news seem to believe that the American public consists mostly of morons interested only in tear-jerking anecdotes and incapable of understanding statistics and analysis. So what’s really newsworthy about that fire is not reported: the astonishingly high rate of fires in the slums at the start of the heating season; the decrease in the frequency of smoke inhalation among firefighters; the low percentage of full claims on fire damage paid by insurance companies—in short, the statistics that get at the underlying causes of particular sensational events.</p>
<p class="indent">Bertrand Russell said that the mark of a civilized human being is the ability to read a column of numbers and then weep. Is the American public as “uncivilized” as the news producers think? Are we incapable of understanding statistical arguments or do we only understand anecdotes?</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to spend an afternoon in any baseball park in America to know how badly the general public’s capacity to appreciate and enjoy statistics has been underestimated by our tastemakers. Every child over six in the park knows what a .300 hitter is and knows Tony Gwynn is more likely to get a hit than Juan Samuel is. Every beer-guzzling adult in the park knows what an earned run average is, even though this is a more <a id="page156"/>complicated statistic than the basic statistics on fire-insurance claims and the dangers of oil-heater start-ups.</p>
<p class="indent">Americans delight in sports statistics. We positively revel in probabilities—when they concern José Canseco or Dwight Gooden or Larry Bird. They are the grist for sports betting, a business now rivaling traditional American industry in gross take. Bill James and the Elias Sports Bureau write massive, ingenious compilations of baseball statistics that sell tens of thousands of copies each year. And it is not just the general public that loves this stuff. It makes for serious scientific reading as well, for professional sports is now one of the best quantitatively documented activities in the world. Theories that make fine-grained predictions about human capacity can use these veritable almanacs of sport to test themselves.</p>
<p class="indent">This is true of explanatory-style theory, and my students and I have spent thousands of hours reading the sports pages and testing my theory against sports statistics. What does my view of optimism say about the playing field?</p>
<p class="indent">Quite simply, there are three basic predictions for sports. First, everything else being equal, the individual with the more optimistic explanatory style will go on to win. He will win because he will try harder, particularly after defeat or under stiff challenge.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, the same thing should hold for teams. If a team can be characterized by its level of optimism, the more optimistic team should win—if talent is equal—and this phenomenon should be most apparent under pressure.</p>
<p class="indent">Third, and most exciting, when athletes’ explanatory style is changed from pessimistic to optimistic, they should win more, particularly under pressure.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c09-s01">The National League</h2>
<p class="nonindent">C<span class="small">ONSIDER</span> the great American pastime—baseball. I confess, at the outset, that I love this kind of science. In spite of innumerable hours squinting at microfilm, in spite of too many midnight sessions poring over endless columns of batting averages, in spite of attempts to invent new statistics only to find them worthless or redundant, this research is more fun than any I have ever done. Not just because I love baseball (I can be found in the third row behind home plate at most of the Phillies’ home games), but because these findings take us to the very heart of human success and <a id="page157"/>failure. They tell us how the “agony of defeat” and the “thrill of victory” really work.</p>
<p class="indent">But stating the predictions of the theory is much easier than seeing if they are right. There are three problems.</p>
<p class="indent">First, does a team—a group of individuals—have an explanatory style? All our past work had shown that pessimistic <em>individuals</em> do worse, but is there such a thing as a pessimistic <em>team</em>? And does a pessimistic team do worse? To answer these questions, we use the CAVE technique and study for an entire season every sports-page quote including a causal statement for each individual on a team. Because sportswriters focus on bad events, such quotes abound in the daily sports section of every newspaper. We use raters blind to who said it and what team they are on, and we compute a profile for each player. We also study the manager. Finally we average all the individuals and get a team explanatory style. We then compare all the teams in the league.</p>
<p class="indent">The second problem concerns the sports-page quotes themselves. We don’t have the clout or the resources to interview all the leading baseball players ourselves. So we rely on what is reported in the sports pages of hometown newspapers and in that marvelous gold mine, <em>Sporting News</em>. Now, what a player says to a reporter is pretty degraded scientific material. The quote itself may be inaccurate, hyped by the reporter to make more exciting copy. The player may not say what he means. He may try to shift or take on the blame. He may try to be overmodest or overmacho for the sake of appearances. So we don’t know if the quotes accurately reflect explanatory style. The only way to find out is to “bootstrap”: If the study does actually predict how a team goes on to do, the quotes must have had validity. If it doesn’t predict, either the theory is wrong or the quotes are not valid indicators of underlying optimism.</p>
<p class="indent">That’s not the only difficulty with sports-page quotes. There is the sheer volume of material to wade through to discover a team explanatory style. In our National League study, we read all of the sports pages in the hometown papers of each of the twelve National League teams for the whole 1985 baseball season, April through October. Because the results looked so fascinating, we then repeated the study for 1986. All in all we “CAVEd” about fifteen thousand pages of sports reporting.</p>
<p class="indent">The third problem is how to show that the causal arrow goes from optimism to victory and not the other way around. The New York Mets, as you will see in a moment, were a very optimistic team in 1985. They were also a very good team in 1985, losing out to the St. Louis Cardinals in a heart-stopping pennant race in the last week. Did they do well because they were optimistic or did their optimism arise because they were doing <a id="page158"/>so well? To untangle this, we must predict from optimism in one season to victory in the next season, correcting of course for personnel changes. Players who leave the team are omitted from the explanatory-style profile.</p>
<p class="indent">But even this isn’t enough. We must also correct for how well the team did in the first season. Take the Mets. They were the most optimistic team in the National League in 1985. They also had the second-best record (98 wins and 64 losses). They went on, as we would predict, to do even better in 1986. Was this because they were optimistic (as measured by their 1985 quotes) or merely because they had so much talent (as reflected in their 1985 win-loss record)? To find out we have to correct for prior win-loss record—to hold it “statistically constant”—and see if optimism predicts success above and beyond prior success. This is exactly what we did in our study of academic success, when we asked if optimism predicted college grades better than high-school grades and SATs did.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="c09-nts1a"/>We also wanted to know if optimism works its magic by governing how a team does under pressure, as the theory claims. My son, David, went through the box scores of every game (there are 972 games a season in the National League), and we invented statistic after statistic on pressure situations. After we were done, we found that the “Elias,” one of the statistical almanacs of baseball, computed even better statistics on late-inning pressure. So we threw ours away and used theirs. Elias tells us how the hitters on a team do in the last three innings of a close game. So we predicted that teams optimistic in 1985 would in 1986 have higher batting averages under late-inning pressure than would teams that were pessimistic in 1985. Again we needed to show that this was above and beyond their overall batting averages, by correcting statistically for hitting when they were not under pressure.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c09-s02">The 1985 Mets and Cardinals in 1986</h2>
<p class="nonindent">T<span class="small">WO GREAT TEAMS</span> battled neck and neck for the Eastern Division pennant in 1985. For the whole season, we grabbed each causal statement that newspapers quoted individual Mets and Cardinals as making, and rated it. When the season was over we took grand totals.</p>
<p class="indent">Here’s what the Mets had to say as the season went on. I will attach actual CAVE numbers to each quote. They range from 3 (very temporary, specific, and external) to 21 (completely permanent, pervasive, and personalized). Numbers in the 3 to 8 range are very optimistic. Numbers above 13 are very pessimistic.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page159"/>Start with manager Davey Johnson, asked why his team lost:</p>
<p class="indent">“We lost because they [the opponents] made the plays tonight” (external—“they”; temporary—“tonight”; specific—tonight’s opponent: 7).</p>
<p class="indent">Their sluggers: First, left fielder George Foster: “I got a fan pissed off” because “It must have been one of those days” (7).</p>
<p class="indent">Right fielder Darryl Strawberry, asked why he missed a fly ball: “The ball really carried. I just about got my glove on it”(6).</p>
<p class="indent">Strawberry on why the Mets were shut out: “Sometimes you go through these kinds of days” (8).</p>
<p class="indent">First baseman Keith Hernandez, on why the Mets won only two games on the road: “All the time on the road began to tax us” (8).</p>
<p class="indent">Hernandez again, on why the Mets’ lead had shrunk to half a game: “They [the opponents] made a bad play and came up smelling like a rose” (3).</p>
<p class="indent">Star pitcher Dwight Gooden, explaining why a batter hit a home run off him: “He hit well tonight” (7).</p>
<p class="indent">Gooden on why the Mets lost: “It was one of those days” (7); “It wasn’t my day” (8); “The heat was too much” (8).</p>
<p class="indent">Gooden threw a wild pitch because “Some moisture must have gotten on the ball” (3).</p>
<p class="indent">You can probably see what all this adds up to. When the Mets do badly, it’s just for today, it’s just these opponents, and it’s not our fault. They hereby become a textbook example of optimistic explanatory style in sports. As a group, they had the most optimistic style of any National League team in 1985. Their average score for bad events was 9.39, optimistic enough for them to be successful life-insurance salesmen.</p>
<p class="indent">Listen now to the St. Louis Cardinals, the team that beat them in the stretch and went on to win the playoffs, then lost a heartbreaking World Series to Kansas City on the strength of a bad ruling by an umpire. The Cardinals were loaded with even more raw talent than the Mets. The Mets batted .257 for the year, whereas the Cardinals batted .264; the Cardinal pitchers had a slightly better earned run average than the Mets.</p>
<p class="indent">Manager Whitey Herzog (arguably the most brilliant in baseball today): The team lost because “We can’t hit. What the Hell, let’s face it” (permanent, pervasive, and personalized: 20).</p>
<p class="indent">Herzog on why the press talks much more to Pete Rose (then the playing manager of the Cincinnati Reds) than to him: “What do you expect? He has 3800 more hits than I have” (permanent, pervasive, personalized: 14).</p>
<p class="indent">Herzog on why the team had trouble all year in games following days off: “It’s a mental thing. We were too relaxed” (14).</p>
<p class="indent">The 1985 National League batting champion, Willie McGee, said he <a id="page160"/>didn’t steal as many bases as he should have because “I don’t have the expertise” (16).</p>
<p class="indent">McGee played poorly in 1984 because “Mentally, I was bummed out. I didn’t know how to accept struggling” (15).</p>
<p class="indent">Slugger Jack Clark on dropping a fly ball: “It was a real catchable ball. I just didn’t catch it” (12).</p>
<p class="indent">Second baseman Tom Herr said his batting average dropped twenty-one points because “I am having a lot of trouble concentrating and keeping my mind on the job” (17).</p>
<p class="indent">What we have here is a portrait of a superbly talented team with a pessimistic explanatory style. This is part of what coaches mean when they say an athlete has a “poor attitude”; indeed, it may be the only active ingredient. Statistically, the Cardinals had a below-average explanatory style for bad events, 11.09, ninth out of the twelve teams. Our theory claims that a team that does very well in a given season in spite of a poor explanatory style must be extremely talented to make up for this handicap.</p>
<p class="indent">And the theory predicts what should happen in the next season: As far as these two teams were concerned, the Mets should have excelled and the Cardinals should have deteriorated, relative to 1985.</p>
<p class="indent">This is just what happened. In 1986, the Mets were a wonder team. Their win percentage went up to .667 (from .605), they won the division pennant and the playoffs, and they came from behind in a historic finish to steal the World Series from the Boston Red Sox. Their overall batting average in 1986 was a respectable .263, but under late-inning pressure it went up to a superb .277.</p>
<p class="indent">The Cardinals fell apart in 1986. They won only 49 percent of their games, finishing nowhere. In spite of massive talent, they batted only .236 overall and deteriorated to a miserable .231 under pressure.</p>
<p class="indent">Using their quotes, we computed the 1985 explanatory style for the twelve National League teams. Statistically, in 1986, optimistic teams bettered their 1985 win-loss records, and pessimistic teams did worse than they had in 1985. Teams optimistic in 1985 hit well under pressure in 1986, whereas the hitting of teams pessimistic in 1985 fell apart under pressure in 1986, compared to how well both kinds of teams normally hit.</p>
<p class="indent">In general I do not become convinced of my own work’s validity until I have repeated it. We repeated the whole study the next year to see if explanatory style could again predict how the National League teams would do, taking all the quotes for 1986 in order to predict 1987 performance. The results were basically the same. The optimistic teams do better the next year than their previous win-loss records would suggest, and the pessimistic teams do worse. Under pressure, the optimistic teams hit well and the pessimistic teams hit poorly.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c09-s03"><a id="page161"/>The National Basketball Association</h2>
<p class="nonindent">B<span class="small">ASKETBALL</span> does two things for us that baseball doesn’t. First, there are fewer players, so “CAVEing” becomes a little less labor-intensive. Second, and most important, basketball is exquisitely handicapped. For each and every game, handicappers predict not only who should win but by how much. The “how much” is called the point spread. So, if the New Jersey Nets were playing the Boston Celtics on any evening in the mid-1980s, Boston would have been favored to win. But you couldn’t bet on the Celtics just to win, since they were so likely to win that no one was willing to bet against them. So Boston would, in addition, be predicted to win by, say, nine points, and you could bet on the Celtics to “cover” the spread—that is, to win by nine or more points. If the Celtics did so, you doubled your money, but if they won by fewer than nine points (or, freakishly, lost) you lost your money. So exquisitely skilled are the handicappers that half the bettors will pick the Celtics to cover and half will pick the Nets.</p>
<p class="indent">I don’t bet on sports—in fact, I have made only one substantial bet in my life (you’ll read about it in chapter eleven)—so it’s not the betting that interests me. Rather, the spread is a terrific scientific convenience because it equates the two teams for all known factors, such as skill, home-court advantage, who is injured, recent slumps, and so on. Explanatory-style theory claims that there is an additional factor which no one takes into account, the optimism of the team, and that this will determine how a team fares under pressure—above and beyond all the known factors. The more optimistic team should do better than handicapping predicts, and the less optimistic team worse. This should only happen under adverse circumstances, however; for example, after a loss in the previous game. This means that the optimistic teams should tend to cover the point spread in the game following a loss while pessimistic teams should tend to fail to cover the point spread after a loss.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c09-s04">The Boston Celtics and the New Jersey Nets</h2>
<p class="nonindent">I<span class="small">N THE SECOND</span> most labor-intensive study I ever did, we read the hometown sports pages for the NBA Atlantic Division teams for all of <a id="page162"/>1982–83, computed the explanatory style for each team, and used the optimism level to predict how the teams would fare under pressure in 1983–84. We then repeated the study, using 1983–84 sports-page explanatory style to predict the 1984–85 season. All in all we read over ten thousand sports pages, and we assembled about a hundred event-explanation quotes for each team.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s look at the two extremes. First, some representative quotes from the Boston Celtics explaining bad events:</p>
<p class="indent">A loss: “The fans [at the opponents’ home court] are by far the noisiest and most outrageous crowd in the NBA” (9).</p>
<p class="indent">Another loss: “Strange things just happen to us there [opponents’ home court]” (8).</p>
<p class="indent">A low-scoring quarter: “The crowd was very dead” (6).</p>
<p class="indent">Loss of a playoff game: “They were making good, quick cuts to the basket” (6).</p>
<p class="indent">Loss of the first game in the finals: “That’s the best I’ve ever seen a team run” (8) and “They [the opponents] threw caution to the winds” (4).</p>
<p class="indent">An opponent’s scoring forty points: “The way he played tonight, he was going to get his forty points regardless of who was on him. We were draped on him. We held him. We punched him, kicked him down, the guy was unreal” (5).</p>
<p class="indent">The Celtics sound like manic patients. Bad events were always explained away as temporary, specific, and not their fault. The Celtics beat the point spread in 68.4 percent of the games following a loss in 1983–84 and in an amazing 81.3 percent of such games in 1984–85. (Remember that on average a team beats the point spread 50 percent of the time. The Celtics beat the spread in 51.8 percent and 47.3 percent of games following a win in 1983–84 and 1984–85 respectively.) They were an almost uncanny comeback team.</p>
<p class="indent">Now listen to the 1982–83 New Jersey Nets explaining bad events:</p>
<p class="indent">Loss of a playoff game: “We are all missing everything” (18) and “We botched up things ourselves and blew all our opportunities” (16).</p>
<p class="indent">Other losses: “This is one of the physically weakest teams I’ve ever coached” (18); “Our intelligence was at an all-time low” (15); and “We’re passing up shots. We have no confidence at all” (17).</p>
<p class="indent">The Nets were not physically a bad team in 1983–84. They won 51.8 percent of their games. But mentally they were shipwrecked. As you heard, they explained losses as permanent, pervasive, and their own fault. How did they do after a loss in 1983–84? They beat the spread a dismal 37.8 percent of the time in games after losses. After wins, however, they beat the spread 48.7 percent of the time. The Nets improved their explanatory <a id="page163"/>style during 1983–8, largely because of personnel changes, and during 1984–85 they went on to beat the point spread after a loss 62.2 percent of the time.</p>
<p class="indent">Overall, here is what we found. A team’s explanatory style for bad events strongly predicts how they do against the point spread after a loss in the next season. The optimistic teams cover the spread more often than the pessimistic teams do. This effect of optimism works above and beyond the “quality” of the team. We know this since the point spread itself holds quality constant (teams should beat it, on average, 50 percent of the time regardless of how good or bad they are) and because we partial out the win-loss record from both the current and the previous seasons, as well as how often the team beat the spread after a win.</p>
<p class="indent">We also found the same trend we saw in baseball’s National League: A team’s overall win-loss record in the next season is predicted by their explanatory style in this season, equating for their win-loss record in this season.</p>
<p class="indent">Consider the basketball and baseball studies together. They show:</p>
<div class="hanging1">
<p class="hanging">• Teams, and not just individuals, have a meaningful and measurable explanatory style.</p>
<p class="hanging">• Explanatory style predicts how teams will do above and beyond how</p>
<p class="hanging">• “good” a team is.</p>
<p class="hanging">• Success on the playing field is predicted by optimism.</p>
<p class="hanging">• Failure on the playing field is predicted by pessimism.</p>
<p class="hanging">• Explanatory style works by means of how a team does under pressure—after a loss or in the late innings of close games.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="section" id="c09-s05">The Berkeley Swimmers</h2>
<p class="nonindent">T<span class="small">HERE WAS A</span> lot of hype in the press about Berkeley swimming star Matt Biondi’s chances in the 1988 Seoul Olympics. He was scheduled to swim seven events, and the American press made it sound likely that he would win seven gold medals, duplicating Mark Spitz’s unparalleled performance in the 1972 Olympics. To insiders <em>any</em> seven medals—gold, silver, or bronze—Biondi won against the competition in Seoul would represent superb swimming.</p>
<p class="indent">The first event Biondi swam was the two-hundred-meter freestyle. He finished a disappointing third. The second event was the one-hundred-meter butterfly, not his premier event. Overpowering the field, he led all <a id="page164"/>the way. But in the last two meters, rather than taking one extra stroke and crashing into the finish wall, he appeared to relax and coast the final meter. You could hear the groan in Seoul, and imagine it across America, as he was inched (centimetered?) out by Anthony Nesty of Surinam, who took the extra stroke to win Surinam’s first medal ever. The “agony of defeat” interviewers hammered Biondi on the disappointment of a bronze and a silver medal and speculated that he might not be able to rebound. Would Biondi carry home gold in his five remaining events after this embarrassing start?</p>
<p class="indent">I sat in my living room confident that he would. I had reason to believe this, because we had tested Matt Biondi in Berkeley four months before to determine his capacity to do just what he had to do now—come back from defeat.</p>
<p class="indent">Along with all his teammates, he had taken the Attributional Style Questionnaire, and he had come out in the top quarter of optimism of an optimistic bunch. We had then simulated defeat under controlled conditions in the pool. Nort Thornton, Biondi’s coach, had him swim the one-hundred-yard butterfly all out. Biondi swam it in 50.2 seconds, a very respectable time. But Thornton told him that he had swum 51.7, a very slow time for Biondi. Biondi looked disappointed and surprised. Thornton told him to rest up for a few minutes and then swim it again—all out. Biondi did. His actual time got even faster, 50.0. Because his explanatory style was highly optimistic and he had shown us that he got faster—not slower—after defeat, I felt he would bring back gold from Seoul.</p>
<p class="indent">In his last five events in Seoul, Biondi won five gold medals.</p>
<p class="indent">Our baseball and basketball studies show that teams have an explanatory style that predicts athletic success. But do the explanatory styles of individual athletes predict how they will do, particularly under pressure? This is the question that Biondi and his teammates helped us answer.</p>
<p class="indent">I’ve never met Nort Thornton. I’ve only seen him on television. But Nort and his wife, Karen Moe Thornton, respectively the men’s and women’s swimming coaches at the University of California at Berkeley, are two of my most valued collaborators. And collaborators like the Thorntons are among the most precious assets a scientist can have. I’ve talked to Nort only on the phone, and his first call came in March 1987.</p>
<p class="indent">“I’ve read about your studies on insurance salesmen,” he said, “and I wonder if the same thing might work in swimming. Let me tell you why I think it would work.”</p>
<p class="indent">I did everything I could to restrain myself and not shout back “Yes! Yes! Yes!” before Nort had finished telling me his line of reasoning. “It sounds like you measure something—deeply held positive beliefs—that <a id="page165"/>we, as coaches, can’t quite get hold of,” Nort continued. “We know attitude is important, but kids can fake attitude and fall flat when it matters. We also don’t know how to change a bad attitude very well.”</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="c09-nts2a"/>In October 1988, before the season started, all fifty of the men’s and women’s varsity swimmers took the ASQ. In addition, Nort and Karen rated each of the swimmers on how they thought the swimmers were likely to do over the season, particularly under pressure. We did this because we wanted to see if the ASQ told the Thorntons anything they didn’t already know as coaches intimately familiar with their athletes.</p>
<p class="indent">I found right away that I knew something the coaches didn’t. The optimism scores from the ASQ were totally unrelated to the coaches’ ratings of how the swimmers would do under pressure. But did these scores predict actual success in swimming?</p>
<p class="indent">To find this out, Nort and Karen rated each swim for each swimmer for the entire season as “worse than expected” or “better than expected.” The swimmers also rated themselves for the same thing, and it was clear that the coaches and the swimmers were on the same wavelength, since the ratings coincided perfectly. I merely totaled up the number of “worse than expected” swims for the season. The pessimists on the ASQ had about twice as many unexpectedly poor swims as the optimists did. The optimists lived up to their swimming potential, and the pessimists fell below theirs.</p>
<p class="indent">Would explanatory style work once again to predict the way people responded to defeat, as it had in baseball, basketball, and sales?</p>
<p class="indent">To test this, we simulated defeat under controlled conditions. At the end of the season, we had each athlete swim one of his or her best events all out. Nort or Karen then told the swimmer that his time was between 1.5 and 5 seconds (depending on the distance) worse than it actually was. So Biondi was told that he swam the one-hundred butterfly in 51.7 seconds, when he actually swam it in 50.2. We chose the amount of “failure” because we knew it would be very disappointing (one swimmer sat and rocked like a baby in a corner for twenty minutes afterwards), but undetectable as false. Each swimmer then rested and swam the event again as fast as he or she could. As we expected, the pessimists got worse. The performance of two stars who are also pessimists deteriorated in their hundred-yard events by a full two seconds, the difference between winning their event and finishing dead last. The optimists either held on or, like Biondi, got even faster. Several of the optimists got faster by between two and five seconds, again enough to be the difference between a lousy race and a win. The swimmers were, of course, debriefed afterwards.</p>
<p class="indent">So the Berkeley swimmers make it clear that explanatory style can work to produce success or failure at an individual level, just as the professional-sports <a id="page166"/>data show this at a team level. Moreover, explanatory style works by the same means for both individuals and teams. It makes athletes do better under pressure. If they are optimists, they try harder and come back from defeat.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c09-s06">What Every Coach Should Know</h2>
<p class="nonindent">I<span class="small">F YOU ARE</span> a coach or a serious athlete, you must take these findings seriously. They have several immediate, practical implications for you.</p>
<div class="hanging1">
<p class="hanging">• Optimism is not something you know about intuitively. The ASQ measures something you can’t. It predicts success beyond experienced coaches’ judgments and handicappers’ expertise.</p>
<p class="hanging">• Optimism tells you when to use certain players rather than others. Consider a crucial relay race. You have a fast athlete, but he’s a pessimist who lost his last individual race. Substitute. Use pessimists only after they have done well.</p>
<p class="hanging">• Optimism tells you who to select and recruit. If two prospects are close in raw talent, recruit the optimist. He’ll do better in the long run.</p>
<p class="hanging">• You can train your pessimists to become optimists.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">I didn’t tell you what else the Thorntons wanted. They asked if I could take their pessimistic swimmers and make them optimists. I told them I wasn’t yet sure, but our programs for change were just being developed, and they looked promising. As a way of thanking them I agreed to give them first crack in sports at our training program.
