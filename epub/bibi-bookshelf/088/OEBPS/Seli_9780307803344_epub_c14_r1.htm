<h1 class="chapter" id="c14"><a id="page253"/>14<br/><em>The Optimistic Organization</em></h1>
<p class="nonindent">T<span class="small">HINK ABOUT</span> the most difficult thing you encounter at work, that time when your job gets really discouraging and you feel you have run up against a brick wall. What do you do when you hit that wall?</p>
<p class="indent">Steve Prosper is a life-insurance salesman, and between five-thirty and nine-thirty most evenings he has to make cold calls—phone calls to people he has never met. He hates this part of his job. He gets the names of the people to call from a list of all the couples in Chicago who have had babies recently. A typical evening goes like this:</p>
<p class="indent">The first prospect hangs up on him after fifteen seconds. The second one tells him she already has all the insurance she needs. The third one is lonely: He lets Steve talk and gets Steve to listen at length to his version of last night’s Cubs game. After thirty minutes, Steve finds out the man is on welfare and has no interest in buying insurance. The fourth hangs up with “Stop bothering me, you creep.” At this point, Steve hits the wall. He stares gloomily at the phone, at the list, at the phone. He pages through the newspaper. He stares at the phone some more. He pours himself a Coors and flips on the TV.</p>
<p class="indent">Unfortunately for Steve, he has been in direct competition with Naomi Sargent. She has the same list of calls and the same tough job, for another company. But when she meets the wall she doesn’t get discouraged. She is able to make the fifth and sixth and tenth calls briskly. On the twelfth call, she gets an appointment. When Steve finally reaches this client three nights later, the man politely tells Steve that his insurance needs have already been taken care of.</p>
<p class="indent">Naomi is a success and Steve is courting failure, so it should be no surprise</p>
<p class="center"><a id="page254"/>• • •</p>
<p class="nonindent">D<span class="small">ISPUTING YOUR OWN</span> negative thoughts is a life skill that any child can learn. Like any acquired skill, it will seem a little awkward when first employed. Remember how unnatural the backhand grip felt when you first learned it in tennis. Disputing your own thoughts is like that. But with practice the backhand became natural, and so will disputing your own thoughts. The earlier in life this skill is learned the more grief will be avoided.</p>
<p class="indent">When the skills of optimism are learned early, they become fundamental. Like habits of cleanliness and kindness, they are so rewarding in themselves that practice is automatic rather than a burden. But optimism is a habit much more important than cleanliness, particularly if your child scored poorly on the depression test or the CASQ, or if you and your spouse are not getting along. In these cases, a child is at high risk for depression and lowered achievement in school if he does not acquire these skills. If he does acquire them, he may become all but immune from the protracted feelings of hopelessness and helplessness that otherwise could afflict him. <a id="page255"/>that Naomi is optimistic and enthusiastic about her job, and that Steve is pessimistic and depressed about his. Common sense tells us that success makes people optimistic. But in this book we have seen repeatedly that the arrow goes in the opposite direction as well. Optimistic people become successes. In school, on the playing field, and at work, the optimistic individual makes the most of his talent.</p>
<p class="indent">And we now know why. The optimistic individual perseveres. In the face of routine setbacks, and even of major failures, he persists. When he comes to the wall at work, he keeps going, particularly at the crucial juncture when his competition is also hitting the wall and starting to wilt.</p>
<p class="indent">Naomi operates on this principle. She knows that in her business only one call out of ten—on the average—results in a face-to-face appointment, and that in turn only one out of three of these appointments results in a sale. Her whole psychology is geared to getting herself over the cold-calling wall, and she has some optimism-supporting techniques she uses on herself to maintain that psychology. These are techniques Steve does not have.</p>
<p class="indent">Optimism helps at work, and not just in competitive jobs. It can help every time your work gets very hard. It can make the difference between getting the job done well or poorly or not at all. Take a job that is not at all competitive—writing. Writing this chapter, for example.</p>
<p class="indent">Unlike Naomi Sargent, I was not born an optimist. I’ve had to learn (and sometimes invent) techniques for getting over the wall. The hardest part of writing, for me, is supplying examples, juicy examples that put flesh on the abstract principles I write about. Writing about the principles has always come easily, since I’ve spent twenty-five years doing research on them. But for many years, when I got to the parts that needed examples, I would get a headache, which told me I’d hit the wall. I’d fidget. I’d do anything other than write: make phone calls; analyze data sheets. If the wall was really high, I’d go out and play bridge. This pattern could go on for hours, even days. Not only would I not get my work done, but as the hours turned to days I’d be stricken with guilt and depression.</p>
<p class="indent">All this has changed. I still hit the wall more often than I’d like, but I’ve found some techniques that always help me. In this chapter you will learn two of these techniques, which you can use at work: listening in on your own internal dialogue and disputing your negative dialogue.</p>
<p class="indent">Everyone has his own point of discouragement, his own wall. What you do when you hit this wall can spell the difference between helplessness and mastery, between failure and success. Failure, once the wall looms, does not stem from laziness, although not getting over the wall is commonly mistaken for laziness. Nor is it lack of talent, or lack of imagination. It’s simply ignorance of some very important skills not taught in any school.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page256"/>In your work, when do you hit the wall? Bring to mind the recurrent situation in your work that most blocks and discourages you. It could be making phone calls to clients. It could be writing dialogue. It could be arguing with a customer about a bill. It could be closing a deal. It could be doing the careful profit-and-loss calculations before making a purchase. It could be seeing that glazed look of apathy in your students’ eyes. It could be exerting patience when a slow colleague takes longer than you think he should. It could be trying to motivate an unmotivated employee whom you supervise. Hold on to your own example, since much of this chapter will be devoted to getting you over your own personal wall at work.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c14-s01">The Three Edges of Optimism</h2>
<p class="nonindent">L<span class="small">EARNED OPTIMISM</span> gets people over the wall—and not just as individuals. The explanatory style of a whole team, as we saw in chapter nine, can produce victory or defeat. And organizations, large and small, need optimism; they need people with talent and drive who are also optimistic. An organization filled with optimistic individuals—or studded with optimistic individuals in the crucial niches—has an edge. There are three ways an organization can use the optimism edge.</p>
<p class="indent">The first, selection, was the subject of chapter six, “Success at Work.” Your company can select optimistic individuals to fill its ranks, as Metropolitan Life did. Optimistic individuals produce more, particularly under pressure, than do pessimists. Talent and drive alone are not enough. As we have seen, without an unshakable belief that you can succeed, high talent and relentless drive can come to nothing. Over fifty companies now use optimism questionnaires in their selection procedures to identify people who have not just talent and drive but also the optimism needed for success. This ability to select for optimism has been proven especially important in jobs that have high recruitment and training costs and a high turnover rate. Selecting for optimism reduces costly manpower waste and improves the productivity and job satisfaction of the whole team. But the use of optimism does not end here.</p>
<p class="indent">The second way a company can use optimism is placement. Strong optimism is an obvious virtue for “high-defeat” and “high-stress” jobs that require initiative, persistence, and bold dreaming. Just as obviously, extreme pessimism is an asset to no one. But some jobs call for a large dollop of pessimism. As we saw in chapter six, there is considerable evidence that pessimists see reality more accurately than optimists do. Every successful <a id="page257"/>company, every successful life for that matter, requires both accurate appreciation of reality and the ability to dream beyond the present reality. These two qualities of mind, it turns out, do not always come in the same body, and few people have the skills you will learn in this chapter, which allow you to use optimism or pessimism when you need them. In any large company, different individuals will perform different tasks. How can you place the right people in the right jobs?</p>
<p class="indent">In order to decide what psychological profile best fits a particular job, you must ask two questions about the job. First, to what extent does the job require persistence and initiative and bring with it frequent frustration, rejection, and even defeat? These are the fields in which optimistic explanatory style is a must:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>Sales</li>
<li>Brokering</li>
<li>Public relations</li>
<li>Presenting and Acting</li>
<li>Fund-raising</li>
<li>Creative jobs</li>
<li>Highly competitive jobs</li>
<li>High-burnout jobs</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">At the other extreme are the jobs that require a pronounced sense of reality. These are usually “low-defeat” jobs, jobs with low turnover, jobs that call for specific technical skills in low-pressure settings. These jobs call for reflective realists rather than the hard-charging individuals who populate the ranks of the “million dollar-seller” clubs. There are also more senior managerial and professional jobs that require an extremely keen sense of reality, jobs where optimism must be restrained and where mild pessimism can be a virtue. These jobs need people who know when <em>not</em> to charge ahead, and when to err on the side of caution. Mild pessimists do well in these fields:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>Design and safety engineering</li>
<li>Technical and cost estimating</li>
<li>Contract negotiation</li>
<li>Financial control and accounting</li>
<li>Law (but not litigation)</li>
<li>Business administration</li>
<li>Statistics</li>
<li>Technical writing</li>
<li><a id="page258"/>Quality control</li>
<li>Personnel and industrial-relations management</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">So, with the exception of extreme pessimism, the full range of optimism finds its place in an optimistic organization. It is crucial to learn an applicant’s optimism level and fit him into the niche in which he can be most effective.</p>
<p class="indent">But every organization has in its ranks individuals who are too pessimistic for the jobs they hold. These individuals often have the right talent and drive for their jobs, and it would be costly and even inhumane to replace them. Happily, these people can learn optimism.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c14-s02">Learning Optimism</h2>
<p class="nonindent">T<span class="small">HE THIRD EDGE</span> that optimism gives an organization is the main topic of this chapter: learning optimism at work.</p>
<p class="indent">Only two groups of people don’t need to learn optimism in their work settings: those who were lucky enough to be born optimists and those who occupy the low-defeat jobs I just listed. The rest of us can benefit, some of us greatly, from learning optimism.</p>
<p class="indent">Take Steve Prosper. He liked being an insurance agent. He loved the independence: No one looked over his shoulder, he set his own hours, he took time off whenever he wanted. He had excellent aptitude for selling insurance, and he was strongly motivated. Only one thing stood between him and striking success: getting over the wall.</p>
<p class="indent">Steve took a four-day course on optimism. The two leading cognitive therapists I mentioned in chapter twelve, Dr. Steven Hollon of Vanderbilt University and Dr. Arthur Freeman of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, and I developed this course for Foresight, Inc. Foresight is a Falls Church, Virginia, company headed by Dr. Dan Oran; it administers our optimism questionnaires to industry and gives workshops for optimism training at work. Unlike most courses for sales agents, which teach you what to say to your clients, this course and the exercises that follow focus on what you say to yourself when your client says no. That is a radical difference. Steve Prosper, for example, learned a set of skills that has made all the difference to him. This chapter is designed to teach you the most basic of these skills as they apply to your line of work.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c14-s03"><a id="page259"/>Changing Your Internal Dialogue at Work: The ABCDE Model</h2>
<p class="nonindent">W<span class="small">HAT YOU THINK</span> when things go wrong, what you say to yourself when you come to the wall, will determine what happens next: whether you give up or whether you start to make things go right. Our schema for thinking about this is Albert Ellis’s ABCDE model, which will be familiar to you from chapter twelve.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c14-s04">ABC</h2>
<p class="nonindent"><em>A</em> <span class="small">STANDS</span> for adversity. For some people adversity is an end point. They say to themselves, “What’s the use? I can’t go on. Why continue doing this? I’m just screwing up.” And they give up. For others adversity is just the beginning of a challenging sequence that often leads to success. Adversity can be almost anything: pressure to earn more money, feelings of rejection, criticism by your boss, a bored yawn from a student, a spouse who refuses to let you out of his or her sight.</p>
<p class="indent">Encountering adversity always sets off your beliefs, your explanation and interpretation of why things have gone wrong. The first thing we do when we encounter adversity is try to explain it. As we have seen throughout this book, the explanations with which we interpret adversity to ourselves critically affect what we do next.</p>
<p class="indent">What are the consequences of the different beliefs that come into play? When our explanatory beliefs take the form of personal, permanent, and pervasive factors (“It’s my fault … it’s always going to be like this … it’s going to affect everything I do”), we give up and become paralyzed. When our explanations take the opposite form, we become energized. The consequences of our beliefs are not just actions but feelings as well.</p>
<p class="indent">I want you now to identify some ABCs. Some of these examples will apply to your life, others will not. In each of these examples, I’ll provide the adversity, along with either the belief or the consequence. You supply the missing component in a way that fits sensibly with the ABC model.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c14-s04-s01"><a id="page260"/><em>Identifying ABCs</em></h3>
<div class="hanging2">
<p class="hanging2">1. A. Someone cuts you off while you are driving.<br/>B. You think______________<br/>C. You get angry and honk your horn.</p>
<p class="hanging2">2. A. You lose an easy sale.<br/>B. You think, “I’m a lousy sales agent.”<br/>C. You feel (or do)______________</p>
<p class="hanging2">3. A. Your boss criticizes you.<br/>B. You think______________.<br/>C. You’re depressed all day.</p>
<p class="hanging2">4. A. Your boss criticizes you.<br/>B. You think______________<br/>C. You feel pretty good about what happened.</p>
<p class="hanging2">5. A. Your spouse asks that you be home every evening.<br/>B. You think______________.<br/>C. You feel angry and frustrated.</p>
<p class="hanging2">6. A. Your spouse asks that you be home in the evenings.<br/>B. You think______________<br/>C. You feel sad.<br/>For the next three, imagine you’re a sales agent:</p>
<p class="hanging2">7. A. You haven’t gotten an appointment all week.<br/>B. You think, “I never do anything right.”<br/>C. You feel (or do)______________</p>
<p class="hanging2"><a id="page261"/>8. A. You haven’t gotten an appointment all week.<br/>B. You think, “I had a good week last week.”<br/>C. You feel (or do)______________</p>
<p class="hanging2">9. A. You haven’t gotten an appointment all week.<br/>B. You think, “My boss gave me lousy leads this week.”<br/>C. You feel (or do)______________</p>
</div>
<p class="extract2">The point of this exercise is to bring home how the ways you think about adversity change how you then feel and what you then do.</p>
<p class="indent">In the first example, you probably filled in something like “What a jerk,” “What’s he in such a hurry about?” or “What an inconsiderate bastard.” In the fifth example, you might have said “She never thinks about my needs.” When our explanation of adversity is external and when we believe that the adversity is a trespass against our domain, we feel anger.</p>
<p class="indent">In the second example, you should feel sad, deflated, listless. The explanation “I’m a lousy sales agent” is personal, permanent, and pervasive—the recipe for depression. Similarly, in the sixth example, when your spouse’s asking you to stay home every evening made you sad, you probably said something like “I’m inconsiderate” or “I’m a lousy husband.”</p>
<p class="indent">What intervening explanation would get you depressed all day when your boss criticizes you in number 3? Something permanent, pervasive, and personal: “I don’t know how to write well” or “I’m always screwing up.” But how did you change the explanation to come out feeling pretty good after your boss criticized you? What you had to do was, first, to make the reason for the criticism something you could change, something unstable: “I know where I can get help at effective writing” or “I should have proofread it.” Second, you had to make your thinking less pervasive: “It was only this report that was poor.” Third, you had to shift the blame away from yourself: “My boss was in a terrible mood.” “There was too much time pressure on me.” If you can habitually make these three moves at the point of belief, adversity can become a springboard to success.</p>
<p class="indent">In the last three examples, you can see that if you thought, as in number 7, “I never do anything right”—permanent, pervasive, personal—you felt sad and did nothing. If you thought “I had a good week last week,” as in number 8, you held sadness at bay and kept at the job. If you thought, as in number 9, “My boss gave me lousy leads this week”—temporary, local, <a id="page262"/>and external—you would be annoyed at your boss but would also hope that next week would be better.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c14-s04-s02"><em>ABCDE</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">T<span class="small">HE</span> ABC <span class="small">LINK</span>, between what you believe about adversity and what you then feel, should be clear to you. If you still need convincing, do the ABC record exercises in chapter twelve (<a class="hlink" href="Seli_9780307803344_epub_c12_r1.htm#page213">this page</a>–<a class="hlink" href="Seli_9780307803344_epub_c02_r1.htm#page17">this page</a>) using ABCs from your workday. Each time you find yourself suddenly deflated, sad, angry, anxious, or frustrated at work, write down the thought that came right before. You will find these thoughts look much like your answers to the ABC exercises.</p>
<p class="indent">This means that if you can change B, your beliefs and explanations about adversity, C will change too. You can change from a passive, sad, or angry response to adversity to an invigorated, cheerful response. This depends crucially on D.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>D</em> stands for disputing your beliefs.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c14-s05">Disputing Your Beliefs</h2>
<p class="nonindent">L<span class="small">ET ME REUSE</span> an earlier example. If a drunk, reeling in the street, shouted at you, “You always screw up! You have no talent! Quit your job!” how would you react? You wouldn’t take the accusations very seriously. You’d either dismiss them out of hand and go about your business or, if they happened to strike a nerve, you’d dispute them to yourself: “I just wrote a report that turned around our red-ink situation”; “I was just promoted to vice-president”; “Anyway, he doesn’t know the first thing about me. He’s just a drunk.”</p>
<p class="indent">But what happens when you shout equally damning things to yourself? You believe them. You do not dispute them. After all, if <em>you</em> say them about yourself, you reason, they must be indisputably true.</p>
<p class="indent">That is a bad mistake.</p>
<p class="indent">As we saw in previous chapters, the things we say to ourselves when trouble strikes can be just as baseless as the ravings of a drunk on the street. Our reflexive explanations are usually not based on reality. They are bad habits that emerge from the mists of the past, from ancient conflicts, from parental strictures, from an influential teacher’s unquestioned criticisms, <a id="page263"/>from a lover’s jealousy. But because they seem to issue from ourselves—could there be a source with higher credibility?—we treat them like royalty. We let them run our lives without even shouting back at them.</p>
<p class="indent">Much of the skill of dealing with setbacks, of getting over the wall, consists of learning how to dispute your own first thoughts in reaction to a setback. So ingrained are these habits of explanation that learning to dispute them effectively takes a good bit of practice. To learn how to dispute your automatic thoughts, you first have to learn to listen to your own internal dialogue at work. Here’s a game that will teach you how.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c14-s05-s01"><em>The Wall-Vaulting Game</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">The focus of this game is your own personal wall, the part of your work that most makes you want to give the whole thing up. In our workshops with insurance-sales agents this part is easy to isolate. It’s cold calling, making calls to total strangers to get personal appointments. You have to keep plugging at the cold calls. Agents who are easily discouraged, who can’t bounce back briskly from rejection, fall by the wayside. Those who can make their twenty calls every evening succeed.</p>
<p class="indent">We use cold calling as a tool to get agents to identify the ABCs in their work. They bring their cold-calling list to the workshop. For homework, the first evening, they make ten cold calls. After each one, they write down the adversity, the belief, and the consequences. Here’s what they hear themselves saying:</p>
<div class="block">
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Adversity:</em> About to start making cold calls.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Belief:</em> I hate doing this. I shouldn’t have to make these calls.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Consequences:</em> I felt angry and tense and had a hard time picking up the receiver.</p>
</div>
<div class="block">
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Adversity:</em> My first call of the night hung up on me.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Belief:</em> That was rude. He didn’t even given me a chance. He shouldn’t treat me like that.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Consequences:</em> I felt sore and had to take a break before making my second call.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><a id="page264"/><em>Adversity:</em> My first call of the night hung up on me.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Belief:</em> Oh well, that’s one no out of the way. It brings me closer to the yes.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Consequences:</em> I felt relaxed and energetic.</p>
</div>
<div class="block">
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Adversity:</em> I kept the woman on the phone for close to ten minutes and then she told me she didn’t want to set an appointment.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Belief:</em> I really blew that one. What’s wrong with me? If I can’t get an appointment from a call like that, I must be really lousy.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Consequences:</em> I felt dejected and frustrated and apprehensive about the next call.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can see that when adversity is followed by permanent, pervasive, and personal explanations (“I must be really lousy”), dejection and giving up follow. When adversity is followed by the opposite kinds of explanations (“That’s one ‘no’ out of the way”), the consequences are energy and good cheer.</p>
<p class="indent">Now it’s your turn to play the wall-vaulting game. Tune in on your internal dialogue when you face your own wall at work, and see how these beliefs can determine what you then feel and what you do next. The game has three variants. Pick the one that fits your work.</p>
<p class="indent">1. If your work involves making phone calls to strangers, take out your list. Make five calls. After each one, write down the adversity, then the thoughts that went through your head and how you felt and what you then did. Record this below, on <a class="hlink" href="#page266">this page</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">2. If your work does not involve cold calling, I want you to identify a wall you face each day at work, so that you can carry out your personal ABCs while you are at work. If you’re stuck, here are a couple of examples to help you do this.</p>
<div class="block">
<p class="bl_indent">One of the walls in teaching is dealing with the apathy of the students; it just feels as if no matter what I do, no matter how creative I try to be, there is a group of kids who just don’t want to learn. I hate the feeling of cramming knowledge down their throats. Knowing that I’m not going to reach these kids makes it harder and harder for me to be creative because in the back of my head I am thinking, “What’s the use?”</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><a id="page265"/>In nursing one of the major things that leads to burnout is the treatment many nurses get from both above and below. Patients are often demanding, hostile, and cranky, and doctors are often demanding, hostile and cranky. This can leave the nurse feeling overworked and underappreciated. A typical complaint is this: “I tell myself at the beginning of each shift that I am not going to let the pressure get to me. Of course the patients are demanding and cranky—they are sick in a hospital. Who wouldn’t be? It’s not so easy to explain away the treatment I get from the doctors. Instead of treating me like a teammate they act as if the work I do isn’t as important and I’m not as intelligent. After a while, no matter how many times I pump myself up in the morning, it gets to me and I start to dread my next shift. I start feeling lethargic and moody, and I’m constantly counting the hours until I’m off.”</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now identify your own daily wall at work. Next week go right up to that wall every day. Except this time, listen to what you are saying to yourself. As soon as you get a couple of free minutes, write down the adversity, your beliefs, and the consequences. Record them in the spaces provided below (<a class="hlink" href="#page266">this page</a>–<a class="hlink" href="Seli_9780307803344_epub_c01_r1.htm#page7">this page</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">3. The third variant is for those of you who face your wall less than once a day. Being unable to get started on major reports or projects is a wall that usually comes up only a few times a year. Another job in which the wall usually looms less than once a day is supervising other people.</p>
<p class="indent">One of the walls managers face is to keep the level of incentive high among the people they supervise. As one manager put it: “Managing people can be very frustrating at times … at least periodically. The hardest part, the part I really dread, is to keep people motivated and productive. I try to be positive, I try to lead by example, but sometimes I just don’t understand what is going through their heads. And then of course, after I have gotten on someone’s case, I end up feeling like such a nag. I don’t want to be too easy on them, I don’t want to be too tough on them, so in the end I feel as if I’m totally ineffectual. As I said, it gets really frustrating.”</p>
<p class="indent">If you’re in this third category, take twenty minutes out this evening at home and go to a quiet room. Imagine as vividly as you can the situation that constitutes your wall. Use props if you have them. If your wall is writing reports, sit down in front of a blank sheet of paper and get into a fantasy about the report’s being due tomorrow. Allow yourself to feel the desperation; work up a sweat. If you’re a manager, conjure up the face of your surliest employee. Play out the dialogue to yourself. Write down the <a id="page266"/>adversity, your beliefs, and the consequences. Do this five times, trying a different twist in the adversity each time. Record it in the blanks provided below.</p>
<p class="extract2"><em>Adversity:</em></p>
<p class="extract2"><em>Belief:</em></p>
<p class="extract2"><em>Consequences:</em></p>
<p class="extract2"><em>Adversity:</em></p>
<p class="extract2"><em>Belief:</em></p>
<p class="extract2"><em>Consequences:</em></p>
<p class="extract2"><em>Adversity:</em></p>
<p class="extract2"><em>Belief:</em></p>
<p class="extract2"><a id="page267"/><em>Consequences:</em></p>
<p class="extract2"><em>Adversity:</em></p>
<p class="extract2"><em>Belief:</em></p>
<p class="extract2"><em>Consequences:</em></p>
<p class="extract2"><em>Adversity:</em></p>
<p class="extract2"><em>Belief:</em></p>
<p class="extract2"><em>Consequences:</em></p>
<p class="extract2">When you have recorded your five ABC episodes, look over your beliefs carefully. You will see that in your own internal dialogue, pessimistic explanations set off passivity and dejection, whereas optimistic explanations set off activity. So the next step is to change those habitual pessimistic explanations that adversity sets off. To do this you must now play the second round of the game: disputation.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c14-s05-s02"><em>Disputation</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">The second round of the wall-vaulting game consists of repeating what you just did, but now disputing your pessimistic explanations each time you <a id="page268"/>make them. Fortunately, mastering the skill of disputing doesn’t take much training. You do this daily, either in reality or in your head, when you disagree with what others say and do. You have had a lifetime of practice disputing other people’s negative beliefs. But what you have missed is treating your own negative beliefs as if they emanated not from yourself but from a jealous coworker or a misguided student or your worst enemy.</p>
<p class="indent">At home tonight, choose the same scenario you used in the first phase—get out your cold-calling list or, in a quiet room, imagine yourself up against your wall at work. Now, for each of the five encounters with adversity, focus on your own negative thoughts and then dispute them. After each single encounter is over, write down the ABC along with your disputation (D) and the energization and feelings that ensue (E). Before you start, read these examples to help your own disputation:</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c14-s05-s03"><em>Cold Calling:</em></h3>
<div class="block">
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Adversity:</em> The person hung up on me after listening to me for a long time.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Belief:</em> He should have let me finish since he let me get that far. I must have done something wrong to blow it so late in the game.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Consequences:</em> I felt angry at the prospect and real disappointed in myself. I wanted to throw in the towel for the evening.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Disputation:</em> Maybe he was in the middle of something and was feeling antsy to get back to it. I must have been doing pretty well if I kept a busy person on the phone for as long as I did. I can’t control what he does. All I can do is present my material as well as I can and hope the person on the other end has an open mind and the time to listen. Obviously, he didn’t. That’s his loss.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Energization:</em> I was ready to go on to the next call. I was happy with my presentation and confident my work would pay off in the long run.</p>
</div>
<div class="block">
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Adversity:</em> The man was interested but he wouldn’t make an appointment until I first talked to his wife.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Belief:</em> What a waste of time. Now I have to take time away from other possibilities to resell this couple. Why can’t he just make a decision for himself?</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Consequences:</em> I felt very impatient and a bit angry also.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Disputation:</em> Hey, at least it wasn’t a no. It wasn’t a waste of time <a id="page269"/>because it may very well turn into an appointment. If I sold him, I can sell his wife. So I’m halfway there.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Energization:</em> I felt confident and optimistic that with a little more work I could have a sale.</p>
</div>
<div class="block">
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Adversity:</em> I made my twentieth call and had only six contacts.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Belief:</em> This is a waste of time. I don’t have the energy to succeed. I’m so disorganized.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Consequences:</em> I felt frustrated, tired, depressed, and overwhelmed.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Disputation:</em> Six contacts in an hour isn’t bad. It’s only seven-thirty and I can still do another hour and a half of calling. I can take ten minutes now to get better organized so I can make more calls this hour than I did in the last hour.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Energization:</em> I felt less overwhelmed and depressed and I had more energy, since I’d planned out a course of action.</p>
</div>
<div class="block">
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Adversity:</em> My husband phoned me when I was right in the middle of doing my calling.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Belief:</em> Why is he calling me now? He’s throwing off my pace and wasting my time.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Consequences:</em> I felt irritated and I was curt with him on the phone.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Disputation:</em> Don’t be so hard on him. He didn’t realize his call would distract me. He probably thought it would be a nice break. It’s sweet that he thinks about me when we’re apart. I’m glad I have such a kind and supportive husband.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Energization:</em> I relaxed and felt good about my husband and our marriage. I called him back and explained why I had been curt.</p>
</div>
<div class="block">
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Adversity:</em> I made forty calls and got no appointments.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Belief:</em> I’m not getting anywhere. This is stupid. I’m not getting any results. It’s a total waste of effort and time.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Consequences:</em> I felt frustrated and angry about having spent my time doing this.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Disputation:</em> It was only one night and only forty calls. Everyone has difficulty with cold calling, and nights like this are going to happen from time to time. Anyway, it was a learning experience: I got to practice my presentation. So tomorrow night I’ll be even better.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Energization:</em> I still felt a little frustrated but not nearly as much, and I didn’t feel angry anymore. Tomorrow night I’ll get some results.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="section" id="c14-s05-s04"><a id="page270"/><em>Teaching:</em></h3>
<div class="block">
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Adversity:</em> I haven’t been able to break through the apathy some of my students feel toward learning.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Belief:</em> Why can’t I reach these kids? If I were more dynamic or more creative or more intelligent, I would be able to excite them about learning. If I can’t reach the kids who need the most help, then I am not doing my job. I must not be cut out for teaching.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Consequences:</em> I don’t feel like being creative. I have little energy and I feel depressed and dejected.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Disputation:</em> It doesn’t make sense to base my worth as a teacher on a small percentage of my students. The truth is that I do excite the majority of my students, and I spend a great deal of time planning lessons that are creative and allow the students as much individualization as possible. At the end of the term, when I have a little more time, I can organize a meeting with other teachers in the school who face this same problem. Maybe as a group we will be able to come up with some ideas that will help us reach the apathetic students.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Energization:</em> I feel better about the work I do as a teacher and hopeful that new ideas can be generated through a discussion with other teachers.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="section" id="c14-s05-s05"><em>Nursing:</em></h3>
<div class="block">
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Adversity:</em> I have six hours left of my shift, we’re short-staffed, and a doctor just told me I was too slow.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Belief:</em> She’s right. I <em>am</em> too slow. I should be able to keep things running smoothly at all times, and I don’t. The other nurses would be able to keep up. I guess I’m just not right for the job.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Consequences;</em> I feel really down on myself, and I feel guilty that I am not doing as good a job as I ought to. I feel like running out of the hospital in the middle of my shift.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Disputation:</em> It would be ideal if things ran smoothly all the time, but that’s not realistic, especially around a hospital. Anyway, it is not my responsibility alone to make sure everything is taken care of. I’m doing just as well as the other nurses on the shift. I may have been a little slower than usual, but we’re short-staffed today so I am taking on extra responsibility, which means things take a little longer. I can <a id="page271"/>feel good about taking on the extra work instead of feeling bad about the slight inconvenience it causes the doctor.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Energization:</em> I feel a lot better about myself and much, much less guilty about any inconvenience to the doctor. The prospect of six more hours doesn’t seem so overwhelming.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="section" id="c14-s05-s06"><em>Management:</em></h3>
<div class="block">
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Adversity:</em> My section is falling behind its production schedules and my boss is beginning to complain about it.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Belief:</em> Why can’t the crew I’ve got do what they’re supposed to do? I’ve shown them all they need to know, but they keep screwing it up. Why can’t I get them to work better? That’s why I was hired. Now my boss is complaining. He thinks it’s all my fault and I’m a lousy manager.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Consequences:</em> I feel really angry and annoyed at my whole section, and I want to call them all into my office and bawl them out. I also feel bad about myself and nervous about my job. I want to avoid my boss until we get back on schedule.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Disputation:</em> First of all, it is true my section is falling behind. But I’ve got several new recruits, and it will take time for them to learn to do it right and work up to speed. I’ve had this before, but never with as many new guys. I’ve given them all the right instruction, but it still takes time. Some are quicker than others, and one is coming along really fast. I haven’t done anything that’s basically wrong. Also, the old hands are performing well, so it’s just a matter of patience, and especially attention to the recruits. I’ve explained all this to my boss, and he knows it’s true—he hasn’t told me to try anything different. I’ll bet he’s under pressure from the production managers. They’re not going to let up, so neither is he. I’ll talk to him again and ask him directly if there’s anything I’ve missed. At the same time, I’ll keep working on the crew, motivating, encouraging, and pushing, and see if there’s any way I can get the old hands to help.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Energization:</em> I no longer feel like bawling them out. In fact, now I can discuss the situation with them calmly and with an open mind. I feel a lot less nervous about my job because I know I have a good record with the company. Also, instead of avoiding my boss, I will meet with him to give him a progress report and answer any questions he may have.</p>

<p class="extract2">You should have found that when you began to dispute your negative beliefs, the consequences changed from dejection and lethargy to invigoration and feeling better.</p>
<p class="indent">At this point, you probably need some practice in disputing your automatic pessimistic thoughts. We will now turn to an exercise that will make you better at quashing them.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c14-s06"><a id="page275"/>Externalization of Voices</h2>
<p class="nonindent">Y<span class="small">OUR BOSS FROWNS</span> at you when you walk into the office. You think, “I must have messed up that report. He might fire me.” Feeling dejected, you slip into your office and stare glumly at your report. You can’t even bring yourself to reread it. You spend the next minutes brooding and your mood gets bleaker.</p>
<p class="indent">When something like this happens to you, you must break off your bleak mood by disputing your pessimistic explanations of the boss’s frown or whatever it was that caused the mood. As we saw in the last two chapters, there are usually four tacks to take in effective disputation with yourself.</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>Evidence?</li>
<li>Alternatives?</li>
<li>Implications?</li>
<li>Usefulness?</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="section" id="c14-s06-s01"><em>Evidence:</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Shift to the role of detective and ask yourself, “What is the evidence both for and against the belief?”</p>
<p class="indent">For example: On what grounds did you think it was your report that made your boss frown? Do you know of anything wrong with your report, something that might have displeased him? Did it take all the obvious factors into account? Did its conclusion follow from the premises? Has your boss even read the report yet, or is it still lying on his secretary’s desk?</p>
<p class="indent">Often you will find you have catastrophized, jumped to the worst possible conclusion in the absence of solid evidence—sometimes just on the thinnest hunch.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c14-s06-s02"><em>Alternatives:</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Is there any other way to look at the adversity?</p>
<p class="indent">For example: What are some alternative explanations for the boss’s frown? These may not come readily to mind, because your automatic pessimistic explanations, unchallenged for years, can be very ingrained. You must consciously search for any plausible alternative explanations. “Is <a id="page276"/>he just in one of his black moods?” “Was he up most of the night preparing for the IRS audit?” “If it <em>was</em> me, was it my report or my wearing a loud bow tie?”</p>
<p class="indent">Once you generate several alternatives, you can go back to the first step and scan the evidence for each one.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c14-s06-s03"><em>Implications:</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">What if your dark explanation is right? Is it the end of the world?</p>
<p class="indent">Suppose it <em>was</em> your report that angered the boss. Does this mean he’s going to fire you? It’s your first slip-up, after all. If he is starting to form a negative impression of your ability, what can you do to turn it around? Again go back to step one: What is the evidence that he would fire you even if he didn’t like your report?</p>
<p class="indent">Just because a situation is unfavorable doesn’t mean it’s necessarily a catastrophe. Master the important skill of decatastrophizing by examining the situation’s most realistic implications.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c14-s06-s04"><em>Usefulness:</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Sometimes the accuracy of your explanation is not what really matters. What matters is whether thinking about the problem <em>now</em> will do any good.</p>
<p class="indent">If you were a tightrope walker, it would be a poor idea, while you were up on the high wire, to focus on what might happen if you fell. It might be very useful to think about this some other time, but not when you need all your wits about you just to keep from falling.</p>
<p class="indent">Will brooding about the worst implications of the boss’s frown just get you into hotter water now? Or will brooding throw off the important presentation you are scheduled to make this afternoon? If so, you should distract yourself from your negative beliefs.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>There are three reliable ways to accomplish that</em>. Each is simplistic but effective:</p>
<p class="indent">• Do something physically distracting, like snapping a rubber band on your wrist, or dashing cold water on your face while saying “Stop!” to yourself.</p>
<p class="indent">• Schedule a specific time for thinking things over. It might be a half hour this evening or any other time that fits into your day. When you find yourself ruminating, you can say to yourself, “Stop! I’ll tackle that at seven-thirty this evening.” The tormenting process of worrisome thoughts going <a id="page277"/>round and round, coming back again and again, has a purpose: to make sure we don’t forget or neglect an issue we should deal with. But if we set aside a specific time for thinking the issue over, we undercut the very reason for brooding now, so the brooding is no longer psychologically necessary.</p>
<p class="indent">• Write the troublesome thoughts down at the moment they occur. Now you can return to them not helplessly but deliberately, when the time is right for you. Like the second technique for distraction, this one also robs brooding of its very reason for existence.</p>
<p class="extract">A<span class="small">RMED WITH THESE</span> four ways of disputing your pessimistic explanations—evidence? alternatives? implications? usefulness?—you now can get some practice at <em>externalizing</em> your disputation: bringing your thoughts out into the open where they can be dealt with. Here’s a technique that has worked well in optimism seminars: Choose a trusted coworker to practice with. If there is no one appropriate from work, your spouse or any patient friend will do fine. Their job is to throw at you the sort of pessimistic criticism that you heap on yourself. Go over your ABCDE record with them, so they can see what kinds of criticisms you routinely attack yourself with. Your job is to sit on the hot seat and dispute the criticisms out loud, to beat them down. Use every argument you can think of. Here are some examples to study before you start.</p>
<div class="block">
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Coworker</em> (attacking you the way you attack yourself): The manager didn’t make eye contact with you when you spoke. She must not think what you have to say is important.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>You</em> (on the hot seat): It’s true that most of the time while I was speaking my manager wasn’t looking at me. It didn’t seem as if she was listening very attentively to my ideas [evidence].</p>
<p class="bl_indent">This doesn’t mean, however, that my ideas aren’t important or that she thinks they’re not important [implications]. Maybe she’s got a lot on her mind right now [alternatives]. I know in the past she has listened to my ideas and has even sought my opinion on a couple of occasions [evidence].</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Coworker</em> (interrupting): You must be stupid.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>You</em> (continuing the dispute): Even if she didn’t like my ideas, that doesn’t mean I’m stupid [implications]. I have a good head on my shoulders and I usually contribute something intelligent to most conversations [evidence]. In the future, I’ll be sure to ask whether it’s a <a id="page278"/>good time to share some ideas with her before I begin speaking [implications]. This way I won’t make the mistake of confusing her distraction for lack of interest in my ideas [alternatives].</p>
</div>
<div class="block">
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Fellow teacher</em> (making criticisms like the ones you usually make of yourself): You aren’t reaching your students. They’d rather shoot spitballs than listen to you.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>You</em> (on the hot seat): The truth is I am not reaching a group of my students [evidence]. But that doesn’t mean I’m not a good teacher [implications]. I’m able to interest most of my students, and I take pride in the creative lesson plans I’ve developed [evidence]. It would be nice if all my students were interested in this subject, but that’s not realistic [alternatives]. I’m continually trying to draw these students into the lesson and to encourage them to get involved in some scholastic activity [evidence].</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Fellow teacher</em> (breaking in): You mustn’t be a very good teacher if you can’t even hold their attention for fifty minutes.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>You</em> (continuing the dispute): Just because I haven’t yet been successful with this small percentage of my students doesn’t erase the fact that I actually am very successful with the majority of the kids I teach [implications].</p>
</div>
<div class="block">
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Coworker:</em> You let her walk all over you. You have no backbone. You must be a real coward.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>You</em> (on the hot seat): Discussing problems with superiors is difficult for a lot of people [alternatives]. I don’t think I was as assertive with her as I am with my colleagues, but I did express my concerns in a clear, nonemotional way [evidence]. Being cautious doesn’t make me a coward. She is my manager and has power over me [alternatives]. It was a delicate situation, and by erring on the side of caution I did not threaten or offend her—which would have closed the door of communication [implications]. This way, before I continue the discussion with her, I can take some time and practice saying what I want to say in an assertive but noncombative style [usefulness].</p>
</div>
<div class="block">
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Coworker:</em> The reason the person you phoned hung up on you is that your presentation is all wrong.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>You</em> (on the hot seat): I may not have made a stellar presentation, but it was good and I spoke clearly and with authority [evidence]. The presentation I made was pretty consistent with others I made today, and this was the first hang-up I’ve had in over twenty cold calls [evidence].</p>
</div>
<div class="block">
<p class="bl_indent"><a id="page279"/>I don’t think my presentation had anything to do with the fact that he hung up on me. He may have been in the middle of something important, or perhaps as a rule he doesn’t listen to soliciting on the phone [alternatives]. Either way, it was unfortunate he hung up on me, but it’s not really a reflection on my ability [implications].</p>
<p class="bl_indent">If you have ideas about phone presentations you’d like to share, I’d be interested in hearing them later today, when I’m taking a break [usefulness].</p>
</div>
<div class="block">
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Fellow nurse:</em> Nothing you do is ever enough. The patients always want your attention, and the doctors are continually criticizing you. If you were a better nurse you could make the patients <em>and</em> the doctors happy.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>You</em> (on the hot seat): It’s true—no matter how hard I work there will still be things that need my attention [evidence]. That’s just part of the job. It doesn’t mean I’m not a good nurse [implications].</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Fellow nurse</em> (interrupting): This is a high-pressure job, and you just don’t have the drive to make it.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>You</em> (responding): It’s not realistic to think I have the responsibility or the power to make either the patients or the doctors happy. I can keep the patients as comfortable as possible, and I can help the doctors manage their workload, but I am not responsible for their happiness [alternatives].</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">It’s a high-pressure job, and I’d like to learn some ways of handling the pressure. I’ll set aside some time to talk to the more experienced nurses about how they manage the pressure [usefulness].</p>
<p class="indent">It’s your turn now. Take twenty minutes and sit on the hot seat while your friend throws criticisms at you of the sort you say to yourself. Dispute them with everything you have. Once you have convinced yourself and your friend that you have a plausible way out, go on to the next criticism. After twenty minutes switch roles.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c14-s07">Review</h2>
<p class="nonindent">T<span class="small">HIS CHAPTER</span> was designed to give you two basic skills to use at work.</p>
<p class="indent">First, you learned to tune into your own negative dialogue by writing down the beliefs you have when adversity strikes. You saw that when these beliefs were pessimistic, dejection and passivity usually followed. If you <a id="page280"/>could change those automatic explanations of adversity, you could change the consequent feelings to invigoration and good cheer.</p>
<p class="indent">To do this, you practiced disputing your pessimistic beliefs. You did this by writing down your disputations when they arose at work and in imagination. Then you used the externalization of voices to give you more practice.</p>
<p class="indent">This is the beginning. The next part is up to you. Now, each time you face adversity listen carefully to your explanations of it. When they are pessimistic, actively dispute them. Use evidence, alternatives, implications, and usefulness as guideposts when you dispute yourself. Use distraction if necessary. Let this become the new habit to supplant the automatic pessimistic explanations you used to make all the time.</p>
