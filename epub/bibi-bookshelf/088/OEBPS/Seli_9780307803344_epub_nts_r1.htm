Modern psychological research, in contrast, highlights the continuity of the two conditions.</p>

Weiner, I. Frieze, A. Kukla, L. Reed, S. Rest, and R.M. Rosenbaum, <em>Perceiving the Causes of Success and Failure</em> (Morristown, N.J.: General Learning Press, 1971) and Julian Rotter’s classic monograph “Generalized Expectancies for Internal Versus External Control of Reinforcement,” <em>Psychological Monographs</em>, 80 (1966) (1, Whole No. 609).</p>

This massive literature has been controversial, but consensus has emerged that pessimistic explanatory style and depression are robustly related, as the theory predicts. P. Sweeney, K. Anderson, and S. Bailey, “Attributional Style in Depression: A Meta-analytic Review,” <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em>, 50 (1986), 974–91, review 104 studies excluding all those from my own laboratory. C. Robins, “Attributions and Depression: Why Is the Literature So Inconsistent?” <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em>, 54 (1988), 880–9, concludes that studies that have not found the predicted pessimism-depression relationship consistently used inappropriately small samples.<br/>   H. Tenen, and S. Herzberger, “Attributional Style Questionnaires,” in J. Keyser and R.C. Sweetland, eds., <em>Test Critiques</em>, Vol. 4 (1986), 20–30, review the history and use of the questionnaire.</p>

How, they ask, is it possible for a depressed person both to believe he is to blame for the tragedies in his life <em>and</em> to believe he is helpless?</p>
<h3 class="section1"><em>Chapter Four</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent2">The most illuminating general reference I know on the psychology of depression is still Aaron T. Beck’s 1967 classic <em>Depression</em> (New York: Hoeber). Two excellent guides to treatment are Albert Ellis, <em>Reason and Emotion in Psychotherapy</em> (New York: Stuart, 1962), and A.T. Beck, A.J. Rush, B.F. Shaw, and G. Emery, <em>Cognitive Therapy of Depression: A Treatment Manual</em> (New York: Guilford, 1979).</p>

The CES-D scale: a self-report depression scale for research in the general population. L. Radloff, <em>Applied Psychological Measurement</em>, 1 (1977), 385–401.</p>
<p class="footnote1" id="c04-nts5"><a class="hlink" href="Seli_9780307803344_epub_c04_r1.htm#c04-nts5a">5.</a> <em>As you took the test:</em> In “The Age of Melancholy?” (<em>Psychology Today</em>, April 1979, 37–42), Gerald Klerman presents some of the alarming statistics on the prevalence of depression and coins the term “Age of Melancholy.” The two major studies that found the epidemic of depression are L. Robins, J. Helzer, M. Weissman, H. Orvaschel, E. Gruenberg, J. Burke and D. Regier, “Lifetime Prevalence of Specific Psychiatric Disorders in Three Sites,” <em>Archives of General Psychiatry</em>, 41 (1984), 949–58, and G. Klerman, P. Lavori, J. Rice, T. Reich, J. Endicott, N. Andreasen, M. Keller and R. Hirschfeld, “Birth Cohort Trends in Rates of Major Depressive Disorder Among Relatives of Patients with Affective Disorder,” <em>Archives of General Psychiatry</em>, 42 (1985), 689–93. Both these studies are gold mines for the serious student of abnormality.<br/>   My one dissent from these important studies is that the biomedically inclined authors speak of them as indicating a “gene-environment interaction over time” in the production of so much depression today. I see no evidence at all in their data for an interaction; rather, the effect appears to be purely environmental. <em>Both</em> those who are genetically vulnerable (the relatives) and the public in general (the ECA population) seem to be getting depressed at much higher rates recently.</p>

Y. Abramson and M. Seligman, “Modeling Psychopathology in the Laboratory: History and Rationale,” in J. Maser and M. Seligman, eds., <em>Psychopathology: Experimental Models</em> (San Francisco: Freeman, 1977), 1–27. The major criterion is the mapping of symptoms from model to pathology. As the reader can see, this criterion is met extraordinarily well in this case.<br/>   The most detailed argument for the close symptom correspondence of learned helplessness and DSM-III-R-diagnosed depression is made by J.M. Weiss, P.G. Simson, M.J. Ambrose, A. Webster, and L.J. Hoffman, “Neurochemical Basis of Behavioral Depression,” <em>Advances in Behavioral Medicine, 1</em> (1985), 253–75. This paper and the important work of Sherman and Petty also lay out the powerful brain-chemistry and pharmacological similarities between learned helplessness and depression (see, for example, A.D. Sherman and F. Petty, “Neurochemical Basis of Antidepressants on Learned Helplessness,” <em>Behavioral and Neurological Biology</em>, 30 [1982], 119–34).</p>

Beck, <em>Cognitive Therapy and the Emotional Disorders</em> (New York: New American Library, 1976). <em>A progenitor:</em> Wolpe’s revolutionary findings were published in J. Wolpe, <em>Psychotherapy by Reciprocal Inhibition</em> (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1958). Freud’s theory of phobia is laid down in the famous 1909 Little Hans case (S. Freud, “The Analysis of a Phobia in a Five-year-old Boy” in <em>Collected Papers of Freud</em>, Vol. III [London: Hogarth Press, 1950], 149–289).<br/>   Wolpe’s therapy has generated a great deal of outcome research, mostly showing that it works very effectively on phobias, without the symptom substitution that Freudian theory predicts. There is still dispute, however, about what its active ingredients are. For a review, see A.E. Kazdin and L.A. Wilcoxon, “Systematic Desensitization and Nonspecific Treatment Effects: A Methodological Evaluation,” <em>Psychological Bulletin</em>, 83 (1976), 729–58.</p>

Sotsky, “Conceptual and Methodological Issues in Comparative Studies of Psychotherapy and Pharmacotherapy,” <em>American Journal of Psychiatry</em>, 145 (1988), 909–17.<br/>   Perhaps even more important, because it also tracked <em>how</em> therapy worked as well as documenting that cognitive therapy worked as well as tricyclic drugs, is S.D. Hollon, R.J. DeRubeis, and M.D. Evans, “Combined Cognitive Therapy and Pharmacotherapy in the Treatment of Depression,” in D. Manning and A. Frances, eds., <em>Combination Drug and Psychotherapy in Depression</em> <a id="page297"/>(Washington, D.C.: American Psychiatric Press, 1990).

Beck, A. J. Rush, B. F. Shaw, and G. Emery, <em>Cognitive Therapy of Depression: A Treatment Manual</em> (New York: Guilford, 1979). The fifth move, assumption challenging, is unique to Ellis (A. Ellis, <em>Reason and Emotion in Psychotherapy</em>, [New York: Stuart, 1979]). The therapies of Beck and Ellis are now very similar and one of the only distinctions concerns assumption challenging. Assumption challenging is typically not much used in the Socratic therapy of Beck, but is a large part of the more counterpropagandistic therapy of Ellis.</p>

Wagoner’s poem, “The Labors of Thor,” in David Wagoner, <em>Collected Poems (1956–76)</em> (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1976), is at the top of my list. The two stanzas quoted are the closing stanzas of what I think is one of the great pieces of modern American verse. I am grateful to Bert Brim for having shown me it.</p>

<h3 class="section1"><em>Chapter Twelve</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent2">The exercises in chapters twelve through fourteen originate first in the seminal work of Aaron Beck and Albert Ellis, referred to in chapters four and five. They formulated the first versions of our techniques in order to alleviate depression among those already afflicted. In 1987 Metropolitan Life asked Foresight, Inc., to adapt these techniques for a normal population and in a preventive mode, so that they could use them with their sales force—a very nondepressed group. I called on the considerable talents of Steve Hollon, professor at Vanderbilt University and editor of <em>Cognitive Research and Therapy</em>, and Art Freeman, professor at the New Jersey College of Medicine and Dentistry and one of the world’s leading teachers of cognitive therapy, to help change basic cognitive therapy techniques in the two ways I have noted. Dan Oran of Foresight, Inc., and Dick Calogero of Metropolitan Life administered the workshop project; Karen Reivich was principal editor of the manuals created.</p>
<p class="indent2">In these three chapters I draw heavily on what we did and what we learned.</p>

<h3 class="section1"><em>Chapter Fourteen</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent2">The techniques outlined in this chapter were developed under the auspices of Foresight, Inc. Steve Hollon, Art Freeman, Dan Oran, Karen Reivich, and I systematized the techniques of cognitive therapy for preventive use by nondepressed sales agents. Foresight developed one-, two-, and four-day workshops for businesses, based on this material. Copies can be obtained from Foresight, Inc., 3516 Duff Drive, Falls Church, Va. 22041 [703–820–8170].</p>
