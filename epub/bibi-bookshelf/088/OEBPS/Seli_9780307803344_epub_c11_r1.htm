<h1 class="chapter" id="c11"><a id="page185"/>11<br/><em>Politics, Religion, and Culture:<br/>      A New Psychohistory</em></h1>
<p class="nonindent">M<span class="small">Y BOYHOOD READING</span> of Sigmund Freud powerfully influenced the questions that have captivated me since. It left me fascinated by “hot” psychology—motivation, emotion, mental illness—and strangely indifferent to “cold” psychology—perception, information processing, hearing, and vision. But another popular writer from my boyhood, usually less esteemed than Freud, left an even deeper mark: Isaac Asimov, prolific science-fiction writer, novelist, and visionary.</p>
<p class="indent">In his impossible-to-put-down <em>Foundation Trilogy</em>—I read it in one thirty-hour burst of adolescent excitement—Asimov invents a great hero for pimply, intellectual kids. Hari Selden is the scientist who creates “psychohistory” in order to predict the future. Individuals, Selden believes, are unpredictable, but a mass of individuals, like a mass of atoms, becomes highly predictable. All you need are Hari Selden’s statistical equations and his behavioral principles (Asimov never divulges these to us) and you can foresee the course of history, even the outcome of crises. “Wow!” thought this impressionable adolescent. “Predicting the future from psychological principles!”</p>
<p class="indent">That “Wow!” has stayed with me all my life. As a young professor in the early 1970s, I was excited to learn that a field called psychohistory actually existed. In due course, with my close friend Alan Kors, then an assistant professor of history at the University of Pennsylvania, I gave a graduate seminar on the topic. The seminar gave us all a chance to look <a id="page186"/>closely at the academic version of Asimov’s vision. What a disappointment.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="c11-nts1a"/>We read Erik Erikson’s attempt to apply the principles of Freudian psychoanalysis to Martin Luther. Luther, said Erikson, got his rebellious attitude toward Catholicism from his toilet training. Professor Erikson had drawn that astounding hypothesis from a few scraps of information about Luther’s childhood. This sort of farfetched extrapolating was definitely not what Hari Selden had in mind. First, its principles wouldn’t accomplish much. They wouldn’t even help a therapist clearly explain the rebelliousness of patients lying on his couch, whose childhood he could hear about in as much detail as he could bear, let alone the rebelliousness of someone hundreds of years dead. Second, what passed for “psychohistory” in those days consisted of single case studies, whereas, as Asimov had stressed, to make valid predictions you need a mass of instances, in order to dampen out unpredictable individual variations. Third, and worst, that kind of psychohistory didn’t <em>predict</em> anything at all. Rather, it took events already long concluded and concocted a story that—with psychoanalytic hindsight—made sense of them.</p>
<p class="indent">When I took up Glen Elder’s challenge, in 1981, to develop a “time machine,” Asimov’s vision was still very much with me, and I planned to use the technique of content analysis—the analysis of written or spoken utterances for what they revealed about explanatory style—to find out the optimism level of people who wouldn’t take questionnaires: mother-daughter pairs, sports heroes, CEOs locked in a hostile takeover challenge, world leaders. But there is another very large group of people who don’t take questionnaires—the dead, the people whose actions make up history. I told Glen that the CAVE technique was the time machine he had been dreaming of. I suggested that it could be used not only on contemporary people who wouldn’t take questionnaires but on people who <em>couldn’t</em>, like dead people. All we needed was their verbatim quotes. As long as we had verbatim quotes, we could CAVE them for explanatory style. I pointed out that we could use an enormous range of material: autobiographies, wills, press-conference transcripts, diaries, therapy transcripts, letters home from the battlefront, nomination-acceptance addresses. “Glen,” I said, “we can do psychohistory.”</p>
<p class="indent">We had, after all, the three essential things that Hari Selden demanded. First, we had a sound psychological principle: Optimistic explanatory style predicts the ability to fight off depression, predicts high achievement, and predicts stick-to-itiveness. Second, we had a valid way of measuring explanatory style in people living or dead. Third, we had large numbers of people to study—numbers large enough to allow us to make statistical predictions.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page187"/><a id="c11-nts2a"/>One morning in spring 1983 I found myself explaining all this to one of the yeastiest twenty-year-old undergraduates I have ever met, Harold Zullow. His ideas, his energy, his originality, and his enthusiasm were remarkable. I explained the CAVE technique to him and described the vistas it might open up, trying to impress him and recruit him for the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p class="indent">“Have you thought about applying this to politics?” he said. “Maybe we could predict elections. I’ll bet the American people want optimists to lead them, people who tell them that their problems will be solved. Not hand-wringers and doubters. You want large numbers? How about the size of the American electorate? You can’t predict how individual voters will vote in an election, but we might be able to predict how they’ll vote as a mass. We could make an optimism profile of the two candidates from what they say and predict who’ll win.”</p>
<p class="indent">I liked his use of <em>we</em>, because it meant Harold was going to come to Penn. Come he did, and what he accomplished over the next five years was unique. With a bit of help from me, he became the first psychologist to predict a major historical event before it happened.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c11-s01">The American Presidential Elections, 1948–1984</h2>
<p class="nonindent">W<span class="small">HAT KIND</span> of president do American voters want? Does optimism make a difference to the American voter?</p>
<p class="indent">Political science was Harold Zullow’s hobby, and he began his graduate research by indulging in his hobby. We reread the nomination-acceptance speeches of the big losers and big winners of recent times. The discrepancies in optimism stuck out. Listen to Adlai Stevenson, twice a big loser, accepting his first nomination before the Democratic convention in 1952:</p>
<div class="block">
<p class="bl_nonindent">When the tumult and the shouting die, when the bands are gone and the lights are dimmed, there is the stark reality of responsibility in an hour of history haunted with those gaunt, grim specters of strife, dissension and materialism at home, and ruthless, inscrutable and hostile power abroad.</p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent">Deathless prose, perhaps, but it also consists of one rumination after another. True to his intellectual reputation, Stevenson was dwelling upon <a id="page188"/>bad events and analyzing them, without proposing action to alter them. Listen to his explanatory style:</p>
<div class="block">
<p class="bl_nonindent"><em>The ordeal of the twentieth century—the bloodiest, most turbulent era of the Christian age—is far from over</em>. Sacrifice, patience, and implacable purpose may be our lot for years to come.…</p>
<p class="bl_indent">I would not seek your nomination for the Presidency, <em>because the burdens of that office stagger the imagination</em>. [italics mine]</p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent">These are two vintage Stevensonian explanations. The italic text is the explanation, the roman text the event it explains. Very permanent: The ordeal to come, many years long, will cause sacrifice. Very pervasive: The awesomeness of the burdens cause him not to seek the nomination. Adlai Stevenson, a man of high intelligence, was an emotional black hole. His explanatory style was depressive and so was his rate of ruminating.</p>
<p class="indent">The speeches of Dwight D. Eisenhower, twice Stevenson’s opponent, were as different from Stevenson’s as they could be—low in rumination, optimistic in explanatory style, and replete with reference to action. Listen to Eisenhower (“I will go to Korea”), accepting the Republican nomination in 1952:</p>
<div class="block">
<p class="bl_indent">Today is the first day of our battle.</p>
<p class="bl_indent">The road that leads to November fourth is a fighting road. In that fight I will keep nothing in reserve.</p>
<p class="bl_indent">I have stood before on the eve of battle. Before every attack it has always been my practice to seek out our men in their camps and along the road and talk with them face to face about their concerns and discuss with them the great mission to which we are all committed.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Eisenhower’s speeches lacked the grace and subtlety of Stevenson’s prose. Nevertheless, Eisenhower won in landslides both in 1952 and 1956. He was of course a great war hero and his opponent’s record by comparison was much more modest. Historians doubt that anyone could have beaten Eisenhower, and indeed the Democrats as well as the Republicans sought him as their nominee. But did Eisenhower’s optimism and Stevenson’s pessimism play a causal role in the outcome of the elections? We think it did.</p>
<p class="indent">What should happen to a presidential candidate who has a more pessimistic and more ruminating style than his opponent? There should be three consequences, all negative.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page189"/>First, the candidate with the darker style should be more passive, making fewer campaign stops and rising less readily to challenge.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, he should be less well liked by the voters; in controlled experiments, depressed people are not as well liked as nondepressed people and are more likely to be avoided. This is not to say that presidential candidates are depressed—usually they are not—but rather that the voter is exquisitely sensitive to the whole dimension of optimism and picks up even small differences between two candidates.</p>
<p class="indent">Third, the more pessimistic candidate should engender less hope in the voters. The permanent and pervasive statements that pessimists make about bad events signal hopelessness. The more the candidate ruminates, the more this hopelessness is conveyed. If voters want a president who makes them believe he will solve the country’s problems, they will choose the optimist.</p>
<p class="indent">These three consequences taken together predict that the more pessimistically ruminating of two candidates is the one who will lose.</p>
<p class="indent">To test whether the optimism of candidates actually affects the outcome of elections, we needed a standard setting in which the speeches of the two candidates are comparable with each other and with their predecessors’ speeches. There exists a perfect setting—the nomination-acceptance speech, in which the nominee outlines his ideas for the nation’s future. Until forty years ago the speech was given to the party faithful assembled in a hall, and did not find its way into most American homes. But since 1948 the speech has reached an enormous audience watching on television. So starting with the year 1948, we extracted every causal statement from every nomination-acceptance speech for the last ten elections, shuffled them randomly, and had raters—blind to who said what—rate them for optimism by the CAVE technique. In addition we rated rumination, by taking the percentage of sentences that evaluate or analyze a bad event without proposing a course of action. We also rated “action-orientation,” the percentage of sentences that talk about what the candidate has done or will do. We added the explanatory-style score to the rumination score to yield a total score, which we called pessrum. The higher the pessrum score, the worse the candidate’s style.</p>
<p class="indent">The first thing we found when we compared the pessrum scores of the two candidates in each election from 1948 to 1984 was that the candidate with the lower score—the more optimistic candidate—won nine of the ten elections. We did better than the polls did, simply by looking at the content of speeches.</p>
<p class="indent">We missed one—the Nixon-Humphrey election in 1968. Hubert Humphrey was slightly more optimistic than Richard Nixon in his acceptance <a id="page190"/>speech, and so we picked Humphrey. But something happened on the Happy Warrior’s march to what should have been victory at the polls. Humphrey’s speech to the Chicago convention was accompanied by riots in the streets of Chicago, featuring police beating hippies. Humphrey’s popularity plummeted immediately and he began the campaign—the shortest in modern history—15 percent behind in the polls. But the story did not end there. Humphrey steadily gained ground and on Election Day lost the popular vote by less than 1 percent. If the campaign had lasted another three days, pollsters tell us, the optimistic Humphrey would have won.</p>
<p class="indent">How did the size of the victory relate to the difference in the candidates’ pessrum? Very strongly. The candidates who were much more optimistic than their opponents won in landslides: Eisenhower (twice) over Stevenson, LBJ over Goldwater, Nixon over McGovern, and Reagan over Carter. The candidates who were just a bit more optimistic than their opponents wound up winning the popular vote by a nose: for example, Carter over Ford.</p>
<p class="indent">Wait a minute. What comes first, optimism or being ahead? Does the greater optimism of the winner-to-be make voters vote for him or does it just reflect the fact that he is optimistic because he is already leading? Is optimism causal or is it a mere epiphenomenon of being the favorite?</p>
<p class="indent">A good way to look at this is to follow the underdogs who came from behind to win. By definition all of them start behind in the polls, in some cases way behind. Leading cannot be making them more optimistic, because they are not leading. In 1948 Truman began 13 percent behind Thomas E. Dewey, but his pessrum was much more optimistic than Dewey’s. Truman won by 4.6 percent, confounding all the pollsters. In 1960 John Kennedy began 6.4 percent behind Richard Nixon. Kennedy’s pessrum was considerably more optimistic than Nixon’s, and he squeaked through by 0.2 percent, the closest modern election. In 1980 Ronald Reagan started 1.2 percent behind incumbent Jimmy Carter. Reagan’s pessrum was more optimistic, and he wound up winning by over 10 percent.</p>
<p class="indent">It is possible to control statistically for being ahead in the early polls and also for being an incumbent, two factors that would inflate optimism. When these factors are controlled, optimism still has an effect—in fact, the major effect—on the size of victory, with the differences in pessrum predicting the difference in popular vote much more exactly than any other known factor.</p>
<p class="indent">There are three possible reasons why optimism works on voters: more energetic campaigning by the optimist; more voter dislike of the pessimist; and more hope engendered by the optimist. We have no direct measure of the second or the third factor, but in seven of the ten elections we could <a id="page191"/>count the number of campaign stops each candidate made every day—a measure of vigor of campaigning. As predicted, the more optimistic candidate made more campaign stops: he was the more vigorous campaigner.</p>
<p class="indent">The nomination-acceptance speech is usually ghosted and highly rewritten. Does it reflect the real optimism level of the candidate, or does it reflect the speechwriter’s optimism, or what the candidate thinks the public wants to hear? From one point of view it doesn’t matter. This analysis of optimism predicts what voters will do based on the <em>impression</em> they have of the candidate, whether that impression is valid or manipulated. But from another point of view it is important to know what the candidate <em>really</em> is like. One way to get at this is to compare press conferences and debates, which are more off-the-cuff, with set speeches. We did this in the four elections in which debates took place. In each of them, the candidate whose pessrum was better at nomination was also better in the debates.</p>
<p class="indent">Then I rated the set speeches and press conferences of half a dozen world leaders (to whose identity I was kept blind) for explanatory style. Remarkably, I found a “fingerprint,” which remains constant from vetted speeches to impromptu remarks at press conferences. The scores for permanence and for pervasiveness are identical across vetted and unvetted speeches, and each leader I looked at had a distinct profile. (I suspect this technique could be used to determine whether a written message really came from the person in question—say, from a hostage or from the group holding him.) The personalization score changed by a constant from speeches to press conferences: In other words, personal explanations, such as taking the blame, are laundered out of formal speeches, but are a bit more frequent in off-the-cuff remarks.</p>
<p class="indent">My conclusion is that, ghostwritten or not, the set speech usually reflects the underlying personality of the speaker. Either he rewrites the speech to his level of optimism or he picks ghostwriters who match him on this important trait. But there has been at least one exception—Michael Dukakis.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c11-s02">1900–1944</h2>
<p class="nonindent">W<span class="small">E DECIDED</span> to see if our prediction of nine of the ten postwar elections was a fluke, or if, perhaps, voting for optimists is just a phenomenon of the television era. We read all the nomination-acceptance speeches going back to the McKinley-Bryan campaign of 1900. We analyzed them blindly <a id="page192"/>for explanatory style and rumination. This added twelve more elections to our portfolio.</p>
<p class="indent">The same thing happened. In nine of the twelve elections, the candidate with the better pessrum score won. The margin of victory was again strongly related to how <em>much</em> better the pessrum score of the victor was. The three exceptions—like the Nixon-Humphrey “exception”—were interesting. We missed on all three Franklin D. Roosevelt reelections. In each, FDR won by a healthy margin, even though his pessrum was more downbeat than Alfred M. Landon’s, Wendell L. Willkie’s, or Thomas E. Dewey’s. But we suspect that in these elections the votes were influenced more by FDR’s proven record in crisis rather than the hopefulness of his opponent’s speeches.</p>
<p class="indent">In the twenty-two presidential elections from 1900 through 1984, Americans chose the more optimistic-sounding candidate eighteen times. In all elections in which an underdog pulled off an upset, he was the more optimistic candidate. The margin of victory was very strongly related to the margin in pessrum, with landslides won by candidates who were much more optimistic than their opponents.</p>
<p class="indent">Having successfully predicted the past, Harold Zullow and I decided it was time to try to predict the future.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c11-s03">The 1988 Election</h2>
<p class="nonindent">P<span class="small">SYCHOHISTORY AS</span> practiced in academia attempts to “postdict” events—to predict the past by studying the even earlier past. So in the notorious <em>Young Man Luther</em>, Erik Erikson takes what he can glean about Luther’s toilet training and “predicts” that Luther will become a religious revolutionary, bent on the destruction of authority. Not so astonishingly, that’s just what Luther becomes. There seems to be lots of room for peeking when the outcome is already known.</p>
<p class="indent">So too with our “postdiction” of the last twenty-two presidential elections. We knew who won, and although we tried to keep the analysis pure and the raters blind—they did not know who said what—a skeptical reader would be within bounds to say “Predict something!” Psychohistory becomes practically interesting, and methodologically above suspicion, if it goes on actually to predict the future, as Hari Selden urged.</p>
<p class="indent">By the end of 1987, after two years of work, Harold Zullow had completed his analyses of the 1900–1984 elections.</p>
<p class="indent">We at last were ready to try to predict what would happen in 1988. No <a id="page193"/>social scientist had ever predicted major historical events before the fact. Economists were forever predicting booms and busts, but when the opposite of what they predicted took place, they never seem to be around to ’fess up. Our findings from the past looked so strong I felt we could stick our necks out.</p>
<p class="indent">We decided to predict in three arenas. First, the presidential primaries: Who would be the nominee of each party? Second, who would win the presidental election itself. And third, there would be thirty-three Senate races to predict. We would begin immediately and gather the speeches from as many candidates as we could.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c11-s04">The Presidential Primaries of 1988</h2>
<p class="nonindent">I<span class="small">N</span> J<span class="small">ANUARY</span> 1988, thirteen contenders were out on the hustings, speaking day after day in New Hampshire, Iowa, and elsewhere. Six Republicans were slugging it out, with Robert Dole and George Bush neck and neck in the polls. Smart money thought Bush would lose; Dole was tough and Bush a wimp. But the evangelist Pat Robertson, the conservative Jack Kemp, and the general Alexander Haig could not be counted out.</p>
<p class="indent">The Democratic race was completely up for grabs. Gary Hart seemed to be making a comeback from sexual scandals and was once again leading the polls. Senator Paul Simon, Governor Michael Dukakis, Senator Albert Gore, and Representative Richard Gephardt were all rated as having a chance. The Reverend Jesse Jackson, it was thought, would get only the black vote.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>The New York Times</em> published the stump speeches—the basic speeches the candidates gave several times per day with minor variations. We “CAVEd” all thirteen and analyzed them for pessrum. We made our predictions. The weekend before the Iowa caucuses in February, Harold—worried that no one would believe we had predicted the future if we turned out to be correct—insisted we put our predictions in sealed envelopes and send them to <em>The New York Times</em> and the administrator of Penn’s psychology department. “If we’re right,” Harold asserted plaintively, “I want to be sure no one says we peeked.”</p>
<p class="indent">The predictions were unequivocal. Among Democrats, there was a clear winner: the still obscure governor of Massachusetts, Michael Dukakis. In pessrum he was head and shoulders better than the pack. There was a clear loser: Gary Hart, the besmirched senator from Colorado, was at the bottom in pessrum, sounding in fact like a depressed patient. Jesse Jackson was <a id="page194"/>quite good in pessrum, high enough to suggest hidden strength and surprise the pundits. Dukakis, of course, won, and Hart finished last, quitting the race without a delegate. Jackson surprised the world and made a tussle of it.</p>
<p class="indent">Among Republicans, there was also a clear winner: George Bush, far and away the most optimistic, with a better pessrum score even than Dukakis. Robert Dole was far down the list, with an even larger gap in pessrum than that betwen Dukakis and Hart. Dole would fade fast by our predictions. Even farther down the list was Robertson and at the bottom, Haig, with the darkest pessrum. Robertson would go nowhere, we predicted, and Haig would bust completely.</p>
<p class="indent">Bush, as it turned out, bested Dole more easily than anyone had thought. Robertson’s candidacy never took off, to the great distress of the Moral Majority. Haig was the biggest loser, quitting without a delegate won.</p>
<p class="indent">I couldn’t believe it when Harold and I sat down in early May to review how the predictions he’d sealed into envelopes in early February had fared. Virtually perfect.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c11-s05">The 1988 Presidential Campaign</h2>
<p class="nonindent">O<span class="small">NLY HALF THE</span> primaries were over when we got a call from <em>The New York Times</em>. The reporter we had sent our predictions to (it was he who actually first suggested we CAVE the stump speeches), seeing how well they were working out, had written a story about it. “We’re going to run it on the front page,” he said, and asked who would win the election. We tried to be evasive. In the stump speeches, we determined, Bush was noticeably more optimistic than Dukakis. Bush would win the election by 6 percent. But we were unwilling to make a prediction on the basis of just the stump speeches. Not only were there few event-explanation quotes in Bush’s speech, but all our previous presidential-election data were based on the nomination-acceptance speech, not on primary speeches.</p>
<p class="indent">Harold was worried, but for a different reason. Both campaigns, Republican and Democratic, had contacted us promptly, wanting us to divulge our scoring method. Harold said he didn’t mind all the reporters’ questions—and I could tell he enjoyed them—but was concerned about the candidates themselves. What if they used our principles to rewrite their speeches to give the voters what they wanted to hear? It would invalidate our predictions for the upcoming elections.</p>
<p class="indent">I told him, a bit uneasily, not to worry. American politicians, I said, <a id="page195"/>were too hardheaded to take our research seriously yet. I could barely believe the findings myself, I said, so I thought it unlikely a campaign staff would rely on them to rewrite speeches. I suggested we send both the Republicans and the Democrats the material; our research belonged to the public. The campaigners were just as entitled to it as anyone else.</p>
<p class="indent">Late on a sultry evening in July, Harold and I sat in my living room and listened to the live nomination-acceptance speech of Governor Michael Dukakis. It was rumored that Dukakis placed enormous weight on this speech and that Theodore Sorenson—the great speechwriter for John F. Kennedy—had been exhumed to draft it. We sat there with our pencils poised, counting the ruminations and explanations as Dukakis uttered them. I was doing the explanations and Harold was doing the ruminations.</p>
<p class="indent">In the middle of it I whispered to Harold, “This is a lulu! If he keeps this up, no one can beat him.”</p>
<div class="block">
<p class="bl_nonindent">It’s time to rekindle the American spirit of invention and of daring; to exchange voodoo economics for can-do economics; to build the best America by bringing out the best in every American.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">It <em>was</em> a lulu. The pessrum was terrifically optimistic. It was one of the most optimistic of any modern nomination-acceptance speech—exceeded only by Eisenhower’s in 1952 and Humphrey’s in 1968. It was much better in pessrum than Dukakis’s stump speech had been. His optimism seemed to have gone way up since the primaries.</p>
<p class="indent">The public liked it too. Dukakis emerged from the convention with a very healthy lead in the polls.</p>
<p class="indent">Could George Bush top this performance?</p>
<p class="indent">We could hardly wait until the end of August and Bush’s speech to the Republican convention in New Orleans. It too was a real roof-raiser. Bush’s explanations of our problems were couched in highly specific and highly temporary terms:</p>
<div class="block">
<p class="bl_nonindent">There’s graft in City Hall; the greed on Wall Street; there’s influence peddling in Washington, and the small corruptions of everyday ambition.</p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent">From his pessrum numbers, Bush’s speech would, in most elections of modern times, have bested the other candidate’s. But not against Dukakis’s July speech. Bush’s address was somewhat more ruminative and somewhat less optimistic than Dukakis’s. We put the pessrum for the speeches into our equations (which factor in the effect of incumbency and the influence <a id="page196"/>of the polls) and turned the crank. From the nomination-acceptance speeches we predicted a narrow victory for Dukakis—3 percent.</p>
<p class="indent">I have never placed a bet on an event—sporting or otherwise. But this looked like an almost sure thing. I called the gaming parlors of Las Vegas. They refused to quote odds. It is illegal, they told me, to bet on an American presidential election in America. This is to discourage anybody from trying to fix an election. “Try England,” I was advised.</p>
<p class="indent">It so happened that I was speaking in Scotland in early September. I had saved up some British pounds and was prepared to lay them all on Dukakis. A friend took me to one betting shop after another. Because Bush had overtaken Dukakis in the polls since his convention speech, I was able to negotiate 6 to 5 odds. The bet was made.</p>
<p class="indent">When I got back to Philadelphia, I told Harold about my bet and offered him a piece of the action. Harold said he wasn’t sure he would take it; his voice climbed an octave, sending a shiver of fear down my spine. He wasn’t convinced, he said, that what we heard in July was the real Dukakis. Harold had been reading Dukakis’s speeches since Labor Day, and they didn’t sound like his convention speech. Neither did the stump speech he used in the primaries. Harold had begun to wonder if the nomination speech was more Sorenson than Dukakis or, worse, if it had been doctored to present very low pessrum. He said he’d like to wait until the first debate before he bet his graduate stipend.</p>
<p class="indent">In the other four elections in which the candidates had debated on television, the person who’d had the better pessrum in the nomination speeches also had the better pessrum in each debate. But this time was different. It looked as if Harold’s caution was well founded. Dukakis had dropped sharply from his convention pessrum, back down to his stump-speech level. Bush had stayed steady and was once again showing a more optimistic style than Dukakis.</p>
<p class="indent">The morning after the first Bush-Dukakis television debate Harold said he still wasn’t ready to take a piece of my bet. His hunch was growing stronger: Bush’s campaign performance and his acceptance speech were the real Bush—highly optimistic. But Dukakis no longer looked that optimistic, and Harold couldn’t help thinking that the July speech was not Dukakis. The polls seemed to reflect this. Bush had pulled ahead, and the gap was widening.</p>
<p class="indent">The second debate was a pessrum disaster for Dukakis. When asked about why he couldn’t promise a balanced budget, Dukakis said, “I don’t think either one of us can; really, there’s no way of anticipating what may happen.” This suggestion that the problem was permanent and uncontrollable had a much more pessimistic tone than Dukakis’s statements in <a id="page197"/>July or even in September. The tone was becoming typical of him. Meanwhile, Bush was steadily optimistic.</p>
<p class="indent">The rest of the campaign displayed the same discrepancy in pessrum: Bush’s stump speech was consistently more optimistic than Dukakis’s. To Harold and me, as we followed the campaign, it seemed that, sometime in early October, in his heart, Dukakis gave up. In late October, we plugged the values of the debates and the fall stump speech into our equation and produced our final prediction: a Bush victory by 9.2 percent.</p>
<p class="indent">In November George Bush beat Michael Dukakis by 8.2 percent.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c11-s06">The Senate Elections of 1988</h2>
<p class="nonindent">T<span class="small">HIRTY-THREE</span> Senate seats were being contested, too, and for twenty-nine of them we were able to obtain speeches both candidates had given earlier in the year, mostly in the summer and the spring. Most of these were the speeches the would-be senators made when they announced their candidacy—that is, well before the close of the campaign. So pessrum differences—unlike those in the final Bush-Dukakis debate—could hardly stem from being ahead or behind in the polls. The day before the election, Harold ran his final pessrum analysis of the twenty-nine and committed himself, with sealed envelopes sent to various unimpeachable witnesses.</p>
<p class="indent">The presidential results were in early, but for us the suspense continued all night long. Not only had we predicted twenty-five of the twenty-nine Senate races correctly; when all the votes were counted, it turned out we had predicted all the upsets and all the close races correctly, save one.</p>
<p class="indent">We predicted that in Connecticut Joe Lieberman would upset favorite incumbent Lowell Weicker in a squeaker. Lieberman did, by .5 percent.</p>
<p class="indent">We predicted that Connie Mack would upset Buddy MacKay in Florida. An optimistic Connie Mack had explained in this external, temporary, and specific fashion why taxes had been raised: “Lawton Chiles [the former senator] went along with the big spenders and voted himself a pay raise.” (Harold scored that explanation a 4.) Mack’s opponent, Buddy MacKay, had pessimistically attributed the problems of Florida’s development to “Florida’s self-perception.” (Harold gave that permanent, pervasive, and personalized explanation a 14.) Though he’d started from way behind, Connie Mack won, by less than 1 percent.</p>
<p class="indent">But we missed Montana’s surprising upset of the incumbent John Melcher by Conrad Burns.</p>
<p class="indent">So there we were. Using only the explanatory style of speeches and the <a id="page198"/><a id="c11-nts3a"/>degree of rumination they revealed, we had attempted to predict the presidential primary results, the presidential election, and twenty-nine Senate elections. We succeeded completely for the primaries, predicting the winners and the losers for each party long before the polls named a winner. The prediction for the presidential election was mixed. I had lost my bet, but Harold believed that the Dukakis nomination-acceptance speech was not authentic Dukakis. The fall speeches predicted a Bush victory. But so did everyone else. We called 86 percent of the Senate races right, including all but one of the upsets and squeakers. Nobody else did this well.</p>
<p class="indent">This then is the first instance I know of in which social scientists have predicted major historical events—before the fact.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c11-s07">Explanatory Style Across Frontiers</h2>
<p class="nonindent">I<span class="small">N</span> 1983 I <span class="small">WENT</span> to Munich to attend the Congress of the International Society for the Study of Behavioral Development, and on the second day I fell into conversation with an intense young German graduate student who introduced herself simply as Ele. “Let me tell you the idea I had when you were talking this morning about the CAVE technique,” she said. “But first let me ask a question. Do you think that the benefits of optimism and the dangers of pessimism and helplessness and passivity reflect universal laws of human nature, or do they hold true only in our kind of society—Westernized, I mean, like America and West Germany?”</p>
<p class="indent">That was a good question. I told her I sometimes wondered myself whether or not our concern with control and with optimism was conditioned by advertising on the one hand and the Puritan ethic on the other. Depression, I said, doesn’t seem to occur in non-Western cultures at anything like the epidemic rate it does in Westernized ones. Perhaps cultures that aren’t obsessed with achievement don’t suffer the effects of helplessness and pessimism the way we do.</p>
<p class="indent">Perhaps, I suggested, lessons from the animal kingdom were relevant. It isn’t just Westernized men and women who show the signs of depression when they experience loss and helplessness. Both in nature and in the laboratory, animals respond to helplessness with symptoms amazingly parallel to those of Westernized human beings. Chimpanzees reacting to the death of other chimpanzees; rats reacting to inescapable shock; goldfish, dogs, even cockroaches act very much like we do when we fail. I suspect, I said, that when human cultures don’t respond to loss and helplessness with depression, it’s because the punishment of endless poverty, of thousands <a id="page199"/>of years of having two out of three children die young, has beaten the natural response of depression out of the culture.</p>
<p class="indent">“I don’t believe that Westernized human beings have been propagandized into depression, brainwashed into the ethic of control,” I said. “But to say that the desire for control and the devastating response to helplessness are natural is not to say that optimism works universally.” Consider success at work and in politics, for example, I said. Optimism works well for American life-insurance salesmen and for candidates who want to be president of the United States. But it’s hard to imagine the understated Englishman reacting well to the never-give-up salesman. Or the dour Swedish voter electing an Eisenhower. Or the Japanese taking kindly to someone who always blames others for his failures.</p>
<p class="indent">I said I thought the learned-optimism approach probably would, in fact, provide relief from the torment of depression in these cultures but that optimism would have to be adapted to other styles in the workplace or in politics. The trouble was, though, that not much work had been done yet on examining how optimism works from one culture to the next.</p>
<p class="indent">“But tell me,” I asked, “what was that idea you had while I was lecturing on the CAVE technique?”</p>
<p class="indent">“I think I have found a way,” said Ele, “to discover how much hope and despair there is across cultures and across history. For instance, is there such a thing as a <em>national</em> explanatory style, one that predicts how a nation or a people will behave in crisis? Does one particular form of government engender more hope than another?”</p>
<p class="indent">Ele’s questions were great, I replied, but almost unanswerable. Let’s say we learned, by “CAVEing” things they wrote or said or sang, that Bulgarians have a better explanatory style than Navajos do. That result would be uninterpretable. It might be more macho to say optimistic things in one culture than in the other. The peoples experience different weather, have different histories and gene pools, live on different continents. Any difference in explanatory style between Bulgarians and Navajos could be explained in a thousand ways other than a difference in the underlying amount of hope or despair.</p>
<p class="indent">“If you do the wrong sort of comparison,” Ele said, “yes. But I wasn’t thinking of Navajos and Bulgarians. I was thinking of a much more similar pair of cultures—East and West Berlin. They are in the same place, they have the same weather, they speak the same dialect, emotional words and gestures mean the same thing, they have the same history up until 1945. They differ only in political system since then. They are like identical twins reared apart for forty years. They seem a perfect way of asking if despair is different across political systems—with everything else held constant.”</p>
<p class="indent">The next day at the congress, I told a professor from Zurich about this <a id="page200"/>creative graduate student I’d met the day before. After I described her and mentioned that she called herself Ele, he told me she was the Princess Gabriele zu Oettingen-Oettingen und Oettingen-Spielberg, one of Bavaria’s most promising young scientists.</p>
<p class="indent">My conversation with Gabriele continued the next day over tea. I said I agreed that East versus West Berlin differences in explanatory style—if found—could be meaningfully interpreted as stemming only from communism versus capitalism. But how, I asked, could she actually get the material to compare? She couldn’t just cross the Wall and hand out optimism questionnaires to a random sample of East Berliners.</p>
<p class="indent">“Not in the present political climate,” she agreed. (Andropov was then premier of the Soviet Union.) “But all I need is writings from both cities, writings that are exactly comparable. They have to be about the same events, occurring at the same time. And they should be neutral events—not politics or economics or mental health. And I’ve thought of just the thing,” she said. “In about four months, the winter Olympics will take place in Yugoslavia. They will be reported in great detail in both East and West Berlin newspapers. Like most sports reporting, they will be filled with causal statements from athletes and reporters, about victories and about defeats. I want to CAVE them in their entirety and see which culture is more pessimistic. This will be a demonstration that the quantity of hope can be compared across cultures.”</p>
<p class="indent">I asked what her predictions were. She expected that East German explanatory style, at least in the sports pages, would be more optimistic. The East Germans, after all, were an outstanding Olympic nation, and the newspapers were emphatically organs of the state. Part of their job was to keep morale up.</p>
<p class="indent">This wasn’t my prediction, but I kept my silence.</p>
<p class="indent">Over the next three months I had several trans-Atlantic phone conversations with Gabriele and received a number of letters from her. She was worried about the mechanics of getting the newspapers from East Berlin, since it was sometimes difficult to take written material across the Wall. She had arranged to have a mechanic friend in East Berlin send her worthless kitchen objects, broken cups and bent forks, by mail—wrapped in newspaper, the sports pages of course. But this proved to be unnecessary. During the Olympics, she was able to walk through the Berlin checkpoints unchallenged, carrying as many East Berlin newspapers as she wanted.</p>
<p class="indent">Next came the labor, combing through the three West Berlin and three East Berlin newspapers for the entire duration of the Olympics, extracting and rating the event-explanation quotes. Gabriele found 381 quotes. Here are some of the athletes’ and reporters’ optimistic explanations.</p>
<p class="indent">An ice racer could not stand the pace because “on this day there was <a id="page201"/>no morning sun to cover the ice with a mirrorlike ice film” Negative event (4); a skier fell because “an avalanche of snow from nearby trees covered the visor of her helmet” Negative event (4); athletes were not afraid because “we just know that we will be stronger than our competitors” Positive event (16).</p>
<p class="indent">These were among the pessimistic explanations: A disaster came because “she is in such bad shape” Negative event (17); “He had to hold back tears. His hope for a medal had gone” Negative event (17); an athlete succeeded because “our competitors had been drinking all night before” Positive event (3).</p>
<p class="indent">But who made the optimistic statements and who made the pessimistic ones? The answers were a complete surprise to Gabriele. The East German statements were much more pessimistic than the West German ones. What made this finding even more remarkable was how well the East Germans did in the games. The East Germans won twenty-four medals and the West Germans only four. So the East Berlin papers had many more good events to report: Indeed, 61 percent of the East’s explanations were about good events for the East and only 47 percent of the West’s were about good events for the West. Nevertheless, the tone of East Berlin’s reportage was much bleaker than that of West Berlin’s.</p>
<p class="indent">“I’m astonished by my results,” Gabriele told me. “As strong as they are, I’m not going to believe them until I find some other way to see if East Berliners are more pessimistic and depressed than West Berliners. I’ve tried getting accurate suicide and hospital statistics from East Berlin to compare to West Berlin, but of course, I can’t get them.”</p>
<p class="indent">Gabriele’s Ph.D. was not in psychology but in human ethology, a branch of biology that deals with observing people in the natural environment and noting in great detail what they do. It started with Konrad Lorenz’s observations of ducklings that had “imprinted” on him and then followed him around—they had formed the conviction that he was their mother. His careful observations of nature soon branched out to systematic people-watching. Gabriele had earned her degree under the two leading successors of Lorenz. I knew Gabriele had done a lot of minute observations in classrooms full of kids, but I was apprehensive when she told me what she was going to do in the bars of East and West Berlin.</p>
<p class="indent">“The only way I can think of to get converging support for my CAVE findings,” she wrote, “is to go to East Berlin and rigorously count the signs of despair and then compare them to the same settings in West Berlin. I don’t want to arouse police suspicions, so I’m going to do it in bars.”</p>
<p class="indent">This is exactly what she did. In the winter of 1985, she went to thirty-one bars in industrial areas. She chose fourteen in West Berlin and seventeen in East Berlin. These bars, called <em>Kneipen</em>, are where workmen go <a id="page202"/>to drink after work. They were located near each other, separated only by the Wall. She did all the observations in the five weekdays of one week.</p>
<p class="indent">She would enter a bar and take a seat in a far corner, as inconspicuously as she could. She then focused on groups of patrons and counted what they were doing in five-minute blocks. She counted everything observable that the literature considers related to depression: smiles, laughs, posture, vigorous hand movements, small movements like biting one’s nails.</p>
<p class="indent">Measured this way, the East Berliners were once again much more depressed than the West Berliners. Sixty-nine percent of West Berliners smiled, but only 23 percent of East Berliners. Fifty percent of West Berliners sat or stood upright, but only 4 percent (!) of East Berliners. Eighty percent of West Berlin workmen had their bodies in an open posture—turned toward others—but only 7 percent (!) of the East Berliners did. West Berliners laughed two and a half times as often as East Berliners.</p>
<p class="indent">These large effects show that East Berliners display much more despair—as measured both by words and by body language—than West Berliners do. The findings do not show, however, exactly what causes this difference. Clearly, since the two cultures were one until 1945, the findings say something about the amount of hope engendered by two different political systems. But they do not isolate which aspect of the two systems is responsible for increased or decreased hope. It could be the difference in standard of living, or the difference in freedom of expression or of travel. It could even be the difference in books, music, or food.</p>
<p class="indent">These findings also fail to tell us whether East Berliners became less hopeful with the advent of the Communist regime and the building of the Wall, or West Berliners have become more hopeful since 1945. All we know is that there is now a difference, with the East showing more despair than the West. But we are working on “CAVEing” the newspaper reporting of every winter Olympics since World War II. That will tell us how hope in East and West Berlin has changed over time.<a class="hlink" href="#c11-ftn6" id="c11-ftn6a"><sup class="frac">*</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">These findings also show us something else: that there exists a new method for measuring the quantity of hope and despair across cultures. This method allowed Gabriele Oettingen to compare what other scientists thought were incomparable.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c11-s08"><a id="page203"/>Religion and Optimism</h2>
<p class="nonindent">I<span class="small">T IS OFTEN</span> thought that religion produces hope and allows troubled people to better face the trials of this world. Organized religion provides a belief that there is more good to life than meets the eye. Failures of individuals are buffered by belief in being part of a much larger whole: Buffering takes place whether the hope is as concrete as a golden afterlife or as abstract as being part of God’s plan or just part of the continuity of evolution. Findings on depression bear this out. Conducting studies in the Outer Hebrides, George Brown, the London sociologist who has made a life’s work out of interviewing depressed housewives, has shown that staunch churchgoers experience less depression than nonchurchgoers.</p>
<p class="indent">But do certain religions provide more hope than others? This question arose in 1986, when Gabriele came to the University of Pennsylvania as a postdoctoral fellow of the MacArthur Foundation and of the German National Science Foundation. Comparing two religions should in principle be just like comparing hope and despair across two cultures, Gabriele argued. The trick would be to find two religions as closely related in time and place as East and West Berlin.</p>
<p class="indent">This is where the question hung until we encountered the fiery Eva Morawska, a young sociologist-historian. I invited her to speak to my graduate seminar on the topic of helplessness among Russian Jews and Russian Slavs in the nineteenth century. Eva presented evidence that the Jews were much less helpless in the face of oppression than the Slavs were. She posed the question of why, when things got intolerable, the Jews got up and left and the Slavs did not. “Both groups,” Eva contended, were terribly oppressed. “The peasant Slavs lived under unrelieved, crushing poverty, poverty of a degree unknown in this country. The Jews lived in poverty and under religious persecution and the threat of pogroms: Yet the Jews emigrated and the Slavs stayed.</p>
<p class="indent">“Perhaps the Russian Orthodox Slavs felt more helpless and hopeless than the Jews,” said Eva. “Maybe the two religions inculcated different levels of optimism. Could it be that Russian Orthodoxy is a more pessimistic religion than Judaism?”</p>
<p class="indent">The two cultures sat side by side in many villages in Russia, so it is possible directly to compare the explanatory style of their prayers, their fairy tales, and the stories they told. Do the materials that the Slavs and the Jews heard every day differ in tone?</p>
<p class="indent">Soon Gabriele and Eva were collaborating. With the help of Russian Orthodox priests Eva picked out large samples of religious and secular <a id="page204"/>material from the two cultures: the daily liturgy, the high-holy-day liturgy, religious stories, folk stories and songs, and proverbs. These were narrated, sung, and spontaneously uttered in the daily life of each culture. They should have been powerful shapers of explanatory style. Gabriele then “CAVEd” all this material. The secular material did not distinguish the two cultures, but the religious material did. The religious material of the Russian Jews was noticeably more optimistic than the Russian Orthodox material, particularly in the permanence dimension. In Jewish material positive events were projected further in time—nice things would last longer—and negative events were more curtailed.</p>
<p class="indent">Eva and Gabriele showed that Russian Judaism was more optimistic than Russian Orthodoxy in its stories and prayers. It remains speculation to claim that the cause of the Jews’ emigrating and the Slavic peasants’ staying stemmed from the greater hopefulness absorbed drop by drop from the religious messages they heard every day. The causes of a people’s emigration are highly complex. But Judaism’s relative optimism is a plausible cause, and one never before proposed. Testing the theory will require ingenious historical and psychological investigation. But at least in the process of their investigation Gabriele and Eva created a new method for comparing the degree of hope that two religions engender.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c11-s09">Psychohistory Revisited</h2>
<p class="nonindent">W<span class="small">HAT USED TO PASS</span> for psychohistory was a far cry from anything Hari Selden would have respected. It didn’t predict, it “postdicted,” and in doing so it peeked. It reconstructed single lives, not the actions of groups of humans. It used questionable psychological principles and no statistical tools.</p>
<p class="indent">In our hands, this has changed. We try to predict events—major ones—before they occur. When we postdict, we don’t peek. We do it blindly. We try to predict the actions of large groups—the votes of an electorate, the emigration of a people. We have built on sound psychological principles, and we use well-validated statistical tools.</p>
<p class="indent">But it is only a beginning. It does suggest that psychologists of the future need not confine themselves to questionable laboratory studies or expensive studies of groups over time to test their theories. Historical documents can provide a rich testing ground, and predicting the future can offer an even more convincing test of theories.</p>
<p class="indent">Hari Selden, we like to think, would have been proud.</p>
<div class="footnote">
<p class="footnote11" id="c11-ftn6"><a class="hlink" href="#c11-ftn6a">*</a> As I edit this manuscript (April 1990), I find myself wondering to what extent the explanatory style of the East Germans over the last few momentous months has changed. The theory asserts that rebuilding and prosperity will depend in part on explanatory style. If it has now become optimistic, the future of East Germany will be bright. If it has remained as dark as it was in 1984, economic and spiritual recovery will be much slower than generally expected. A forecast: the changes in explanatory style of East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Poland, Hungary, and Bulgaria should predict how successfully these nations will exploit their newly won freedom.</p>
