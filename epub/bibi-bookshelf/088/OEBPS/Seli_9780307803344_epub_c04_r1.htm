<h1 class="chapter" id="c04"><a id="page54"/>4<br/><em>Ultimate Pessimism</em></h1>
<p class="nonindent"><a id="c04-nts1a"/>W<span class="small">HEN IN A</span> pessimistic, melancholy state, we are going through a mild version of a major mental disorder: depression. Depression is pessimism writ large, and to understand pessimism, a subtle phenomenon, it helps to look at the expanded, exaggerated form. This is the technique used by author and illustrator David Macaulay to show us how small everyday devices work. In one of his best-selling books, for example, he shows us how a wristwatch functions by drawing the mechanisms of an immense, vastly expanded watch, all of whose parts are big and easily distinguishable, and walking us through the insides. A study of depression similarly illuminates pessimism. Depression is worth studying in its own right, but it also has a great deal to reveal to people who are concerned merely with the mindset we call pessimism.</p>
<p class="indent">Almost all of us have gone through depression and know how it poisons daily life. For some it is a rare experience, descending on us only when several of our best hopes all collapse at once. For many of us, it is more familiar, a state that afflicts us every time we are defeated. For still others, it is a constant companion, draining the joy from even our best times and darkening the grayer times to an unrelieved black.</p>
<p class="indent">Until recently, depression was a mystery. Who was most at risk, where it came from, how to make it lift—all were enigmas. Today, thanks to twenty-five years of intensive scientific research on the part of hundreds of psychologists and psychiatrists around the world, the shape of the answers to these questions is known.</p>
<p class="indent">Depression comes in three kinds. The first is called normal depression, and it is the type each of us knows well. It springs from the pain and loss <a id="page55"/>that are inevitable parts of being members of a sapient species, creatures who think about the future. We don’t get the jobs we want. Our stocks go down. We get rejected by people we love; our spouses die. We give bad lectures and write bad books. We age. When such losses occur, what happens next is regular and predictable: We feel sad and helpless. We become passive and lethargic. We absolutely believe that our prospects are bleak and that we lack the talent to make them brighter. We don’t do our work well, and we may be absent from it frequently. The zest goes out of activities we used to enjoy, and we lose our interest in food, company, sex. We can’t sleep.</p>
<p class="indent">But after a while, by one of nature’s benevolent mysteries, we start to get better. Normal depression is extremely common—it’s the common cold of mental illness. I have repeatedly found that at any moment approximately 25 percent of us are going through an episode of normal depression, at least in mild form.</p>
<p class="indent">The two other kinds of depression are called depressive disorders: unipolar and bipolar depression. These provide everyday work for clinical psychologists and psychiatrists. What determines the difference between them is whether or not mania is involved. Mania is a psychological condition with a set of symptoms that look like the opposite of depression: unwarranted euphoria, grandiosity, frenetic talk and action, and inflated self-esteem.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="c04-nts2a"/>Bipolar depression always involves manic episodes; it is also called manic-depression (with mania as one pole and depression as the other). Unipolar depressives never have manic episodes. Another difference between the two is that bipolar depression is much more heritable. If one of two identical twins has bipolar depression, there is a 72 percent chance the other also has it. (This is true of only 14 percent of fraternal twins. Fraternal twins are no more closely related than any other full siblings, but they are born at the same time and raised together by the same parents, so a comparison between the two types of twins helps us separate what is learned from what is genetically inherited.) Bipolar depression is exquisitely responsive to a “wonder drug,” lithium carbonate. In more than 80 percent of cases of bipolar depression, lithium will relieve the mania to a marked extent and, to a lesser extent, the depression. Unlike normal and unipolar depression, manic-depression is an illness, appropriately viewed as a disorder of the body and treated medically.</p>
<p class="indent">The question arises whether unipolar depression, also a certified disorder, and normal depression are related. I believe they are the same thing, differing only in the number of symptoms and their severity. One person may be diagnosed as having unipolar depression and be labeled a patient, <a id="page56"/>while another, held to be suffering from acute symptoms of normal depression, may not be considered a patient. The distinction between these two is shallow. It may be a distinction in how readily two people will seek therapy, or in whether their insurance policies cover unipolar depression, or in how comfortably they can bear the stigma of being labeled a patient.</p>
<p class="indent">My view radically differs from the prevailing medical opinion, which holds that unipolar depression is an illness and normal depression just a passing demoralization of no clinical interest. This view is the dominant one in spite of a complete absence of evidence that unipolar depression is anything more than just severe normal depression. No one has established the kind of distinction between them that has been established between dwarfs, for instance, and short normal people—a qualitative distinction.</p>
<p class="indent">The clincher, I feel, is that normal depression and unipolar depression are recognized in exactly the same way. Both involve the same four types of negative change: in thought, mood, behavior, and physical responses.</p>
<p class="indent">I remember a certain student of mine, whom I’ll call Sophie. She’d entered the University of Pennsylvania with a superb high school record. She had been president of her class, its salutatorian, and a popular, pretty cheerleader. Everything she wanted fell into her lap. Good grades came with no effort and boys competed for her affections. She was an only child, doted on by her parents, both of them professionals; her successes were their triumphs, her failures their agonies. Her friends nicknamed her “Golden Girl.”</p>
<p class="indent">When I first met her, in therapy in her junior year, she was no longer a golden girl. Her romantic life and her academic life were a mess, and she was calamitously depressed. Like most depressives, she had sought therapy not after one traumatic event but after a series of discontents that had been accumulating over several months. She said she felt “empty.” She felt there was no hope for her because she was “unlovable” and “untalented,” and “a washout.” Her classes were boring, the whole academic system a “conspiracy to stifle” her creativity, and her feminist activity a “pointless fraud.” In her last semester, she’d gotten two F’s. She couldn’t get started on any of her projects. When she sat down at her desk to start her homework, she couldn’t decide which of the growing piles to tackle first. She would stare at the piles for about fifteen minutes, then give up in despair and switch on the TV. She was currently living with a dropout. She felt exploited and worthless whenever they had sex, and the sexual activity that used to bring her ecstasy was little better than disgusting to her now.</p>
<p class="indent">Her major was philosophy, and she’d become particularly attracted to existentialism. She accepted the doctrine that life was absurd, and this too filled her with despair.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page57"/>I reminded her she was a talented student and an attractive woman, and she burst into tears. “I fooled you too!” she cried.</p>
<p class="extract">A<span class="small">S</span> I <span class="small">HAVE SAID</span>, one of the four criteria of depression is a negative change in thought. The way you think when you are depressed differs from the way you think when you are not depressed. When you are depressed you have a dour picture of yourself, the world, and the future. Sophie’s future looked hopeless to her, and she attributed this to her lack of talent.</p>
<p class="indent">When you’re depressed, small obstacles seem like insurmountable barriers. You believe everything you touch turns to ashes. You have an endless supply of reasons why each of your successes is really a failure. The stack of papers on Sophie’s desk looked like a mountain to her.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="c04-nts3a"/>Aaron Beck, one of the world’s leading therapists, had a patient who, in the middle of a deep depression, had managed to wallpaper a kitchen. The patient saw this achievement as a failure:</p>
<div class="block">
<p class="bl_hanging"><em>Therapist:</em> Why didn’t you rate wallpapering the kitchen as a mastery experience?</p>
<p class="bl_hanging"><em>Patient:</em> Because the flowers didn’t line up.</p>
<p class="bl_hanging"><em>Therapist:</em> You did in fact complete the job?</p>
<p class="bl_hanging"><em>Patient:</em> Yes.</p>
<p class="bl_hanging"><em>Therapist:</em> Your kitchen?</p>
<p class="bl_hanging"><em>Patient:</em> No, I helped a neighbor do his kitchen.</p>
<p class="bl_hanging"><em>Therapist:</em> Did he do most of the work?</p>
<p class="bl_hanging"><em>Patient:</em> No, I really did almost all of it. He hadn’t wallpapered before.</p>
<p class="bl_hanging"><em>Therapist:</em> Did anything else go wrong? Did you spill paste all over? Ruin a lot of wallpaper? Leave a big mess?</p>
<p class="bl_hanging"><em>Patient:</em> No, the only problem was that the flowers didn’t line up.</p>
<p class="bl_hanging"><em>Therapist:</em> Just how far off was the alignment of the flowers?</p>
<p class="bl_hanging"><em>Patient</em> (holding his fingers about an eighth of an inch apart): About this much.</p>
<p class="bl_hanging"><em>Therapist:</em> On each strip of paper?</p>
<p class="bl_hanging"><em>Patient:</em> No … on two or three pieces.</p>
<p class="bl_hanging"><em>Therapist:</em> Out of how many?</p>
<p class="bl_hanging"><em>Patient:</em> About twenty or twenty-five.</p>
<p class="bl_hanging"><em>Therapist:</em> Did anyone else notice it?</p>
<p class="bl_hanging"><em>Patient:</em> No. In fact my neighbor thought it was great.</p>
<p class="bl_hanging"><em>Therapist:</em> Could you see the defect when you stood back and looked at the whole wall?</p>
<p class="bl_hanging"><em>Patient:</em> Well, not really.</p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent"><a id="page58"/>The patient considered the well-done job a failure because in his view, he just couldn’t get anything right.</p>
<p class="indent">A pessimistic explanatory style is at the core of depressed thinking. A negative concept of the future, the self, and the world stems from seeing the causes of bad events as permanent, pervasive, and personal, and seeing the causes of good events in the opposite way. My depressed student Sophie, for example, blamed her troubles on her lack of talent, her unattractiveness, and the purposelessness of existence. The wallpaperer saw the minor alignment problem as an indication of his whole being.</p>
<p class="indent">The second way we recognize both unipolar and normal depression is a negative change in mood. When you are depressed, you feel awful: sad, discouraged, sunk in a pit of despair. You may cry a lot, or you may be beyond tears; on her worst days Sophie would stay in bed sobbing until lunchtime. Life goes sour. Formerly enjoyable activities become savorless mockeries. Jokes are no longer funny but unbearably ironic.</p>
<p class="indent">A depressed mood is not usually unbroken. It changes with time of day. Typically it is near its worst just when you wake up. Thoughts of your past defeats and of the losses the new day is sure to bring may overwhelm you while you are lying in bed. If you stay in bed, your mood will lie upon you like a clammy sheet. Getting up and beginning the day lightens the mood, which usually improves as the day goes on, although it will worsen again a bit during the low time of your basic rest and activity cycle (BRAC), usually from three to six <span class="small">P.M</span>. Evening is likely to be the least depressed time of day. Three to five <span class="small">A.M</span>., if you are awake, is the worst.</p>
<p class="indent">Sadness is not the only mood of depression; anxiety and irritability are often present. But when depression gets very intense, anxiety and hostility drop away and the sufferer becomes numb and blank.</p>
<p class="indent">The third symptom of depression concerns behavior. The depressive shows three behavioral symptoms: passivity, indecisiveness, and suicidal action.</p>
<p class="indent">Depressed people often cannot get started on any but the most routine tasks, and they give up easily when impeded. A novelist can’t get the first word written. When he finally does manage to get going, he quits writing when the screen on his word processor flickers, and he doesn’t go back for a month.</p>
<p class="indent">Depressed people cannot decide among alternatives. A depressed student phones for a pizza and, when asked if he wants it plain or with a topping, stares paralyzed at the receiver. After fifteen seconds of silence, he hangs up. Sophie couldn’t get started on her homework; she couldn’t even decide what subject to study first.</p>
<p class="indent">Many depressed people think about and attempt suicide. They generally <a id="page59"/>have one or both of two motives. The first is surcease: The prospect of going on as they are is intolerable, and they want to end it all. The other is manipulation: They want to get love back, or get revenge, or have the last word in an argument.</p>
<p class="indent">The final symptom of depression has to do with the physical self. Depression is often accompanied by undesirable physical symptoms; the more severe the depression, the more symptoms. The appetites diminish. You can’t eat. You can’t make love. Sophie found sex, formerly the high point of her relationship with the young man she lived with, repugnant. Even sleep is affected: You wake up too early and toss and turn, trying unsuccessfully to get back to sleep. Finally the alarm clock goes off, and you begin the new day not just depressed but exhausted.</p>
<p class="indent">These four symptoms—negative changes in thought, mood, behavior, and physical response—diagnose depression, whether unipolar or normal. To be considered depressed, you don’t need to have all four symptoms, and it’s not necessary that any particular symptom be present. The more symptoms you have, however, and the more intense each is, the more certain you can be the problem is depression.</p>
<h3 class="section"><em>Test Your Depression</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent"><a id="c04-nts4a"/>How depressed are you right now?</p>
<p class="indent">I want you now to take a widely used test for depression, developed by Lenore Radloff at the Center for Epidemiological Studies of the National Institute of Mental Health. This test, called the CES–D (Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression), covers all the symptoms of depression. Circle the answer which best describes how you have felt <em>over the past week</em>.</p>

<p class="indent">This test is easy to score. Add up the numbers you circled for the questions. If you couldn’t decide and circled two numbers for the same question, count only the higher of the two. Your score will be between 0 and 60.</p>
<p class="indent">Before interpreting your score, you should know that getting a high score is not equivalent to a diagnosis of depression. A diagnosis depends on other factors, such as how long your symptoms have lasted, and it can <a id="page63"/>be made only after a thorough interview with a qualified psychologist or psychiatrist. Rather, this test gives an accurate indication of your level of depressive symptoms right now.</p>
<p class="indent">If you scored from 0 to 9, you are in the nondepressed range, below the mean of American adults. A score of 10 to 15 puts you in the mildly depressed range; and 16 to 24 in the moderately depressed range. If you scored over 24, you may be severely depressed.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>If you scored in the severely depressed range or, whatever the range you scored in, and in addition you believe that you would kill yourself if you had a chance, I urge you to see a mental-health professional right away</em>. If you scored in the moderately depressed range <em>and</em> in addition you would like to kill yourself, you should see a professional right away. If you scored in the moderate range, take the test again in two weeks. If you still score in that range, make an appointment with a mental-health professional.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="c04-nts5a"/>As you took the test you probably realized you or someone you love suffers recurrently from this all-too-common malady. It is by no means surprising that almost everyone, even if he is not depressed, knows someone who is, for the United States is experiencing an unparalleled epidemic of depression. Dr. Gerald Klerman, when he was the director of the U.S. government’s Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Agency, coined the apt term “The Age of Melancholy” to describe our era.</p>
<p class="indent">In the late 1970s, Klerman sponsored two major studies of the rate of mental illness in America, and the findings were startling. The first, called the ECA (epidemiological catchment area) Study, was designed to find out how much mental illness, of every kind, there is in the United States. Researchers visited and interviewed 9,500 people who were randomly picked to be a cross section of adult Americans. They were all given the same diagnostic interview that a troubled patient who walks into a knowledgeable psychologist’s or psychiatrist’s office would get.</p>
<p class="indent">Because such an unusually large number or adults of different ages were interviewed, and asked <em>if and when</em> they had experienced major symptoms, the study gave an unprecedented picture of mental illness over many years and made it possible to trace the changes that had taken place over the course of the twentieth century. One of the most striking changes was in the so-called lifetime prevalence of depression—that is, in the percentage of the population that has been depressed at least once in their lifetime. (Obviously, the older you are the more chance you have had to get any given disorder. The lifetime prevalence of broken legs, for instance, goes up with age, since the older you are, the more opportunities you have had to break a leg.)</p>
<p class="indent">What everyone who was interested in depression expected was that the <a id="page64"/>earlier in the century a person was born, the higher would be the person’s lifetime prevalence of depression—that is, the more episodes of depression he would have had. If you’d been born in 1920, you’d have had more chances to suffer depression than if you’d been born in 1960. Before they saw the findings, medical statisticians would have stated that if you were twenty-five years old at the time you were interviewed for the study—if, that is, you were born around 1955—there was about a 6 percent chance you’d had at least one instance of severe depression, and if you were between twenty-five and forty-four years old, your risk of acute depression would have climbed—say, to about 9 percent—as any sensible cumulative statistic should.</p>
<p class="indent">When the statisticians looked at the findings, they saw something very odd. The people born around 1925—who, since they were older, had had more chance to get the disorder—hadn’t suffered much depression at all. Not 9 percent but only 4 percent of them had had an episode. And when the statisticians looked at the findings for people born even earlier—before World War I—they found something even more astounding. Again, the lifetime prevalence had not climbed, as one would have thought; it nosedived to a mere 1 percent.</p>
<p class="indent">These findings were probably not artifacts of forgetting or reporting biases. So this suggests that people born in the middle third of the century are ten times likelier to suffer depression than people born in the first third.</p>
<p class="indent">One study, however—even one done as well as the ECA Study—does not entitle scientists to shout “Epidemic.” Fortunately, the National Institute of Mental Health had done another study, called the Relatives Study, at the same time. It was similar to the ECA Study in design, and it too covered a considerable number of people. This time the people weren’t randomly selected; they were chosen because they had close relatives who had been hospitalized for severe depression. The questioners started with 523 people who had already been severely depressed. Almost all the readily available first-degree relatives of these people—a total of 2,289 fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, sons, and daughters—received an identical diagnostic interview. The aim was to find out if these relatives had ever been seriously depressed too, to see if relatives of seriously depressed people are at greater risk of depression than the population at large. Knowing this would help untangle the genetic from the environmental contribution to depression.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, as in the ECA Study, the findings turned expectations upside down. They showed a greater than tenfold increase in depression over the course of the century.</p>
<p class="indent">Consider just the women. Those studied who had been born during the <a id="page65"/>Korean War period (which means they were about thirty years old at the time of the ECA Study) were ten times likelier to have had an episode of depression than women born around World War I were, even though the older women (in their seventies at the time of the study) had had much more opportunity to become depressed.</p>
<p class="indent">Back when the women of the World War I generation were thirty (the age the Korean War women now were), only 3 percent of them had had a severe depression. Contrast this with the fate of the women of the Korean War period: By the time they were thirty, 60 percent of them had been severely depressed—a twentyfold difference.</p>
<p class="indent">The statistics on the males in the study showed the same surprising reversal. Though the men suffered only about half as much depression as the women (a crucial fact I’ll discuss in the next chapter), the percentage of men who had been depressed displayed the same strong increase over the course of the century.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="c04-nts6a"/>Not only is severe depression much more common now; it also attacks its victims much younger. If you were born in the 1930s and later had a depressed relative, your own first depression, if you had one, would likely strike between the ages of thirty and thirty-five. If you were born in 1956, your first depression would probably strike when you were between twenty and twenty-five—ten years sooner. Since severe depression recurs in about half of those who have had it once, the extra ten years of vulnerability to depression add up to an ocean of tears.</p>
<p class="indent">And there may be other oceans, for these studies are concerned only with severe depression. Milder depression, which so many of us have experienced, may show just the same trend: There may be a great deal more of it than there used to be. Americans, on average, may be more depressed, and at a younger age, than they have ever been: unprecedented psychological misery in a nation with unprecedented prosperity and material well-being.</p>
<p class="indent">In any case, there is more than enough to warrant shouting “Epidemic.”</p>
<p class="extract">I <span class="small">HAVE</span> spent the last twenty years trying to learn what causes depression. Here is what I think.</p>
<p class="indent">Bipolar depression (manic-depression) is an illness of the body, biological in origin and containable by drugs.</p>
<p class="indent">Some unipolar depressions, too, are partly biological, particularly the fiercest ones. Some unipolar depression is inherited. If one of two identical twins is depressed, the other is somewhat more likely to be depressed than if they’d been fraternal twins. This kind of unipolar depression can often <a id="page66"/>be contained with drugs, although not nearly as successfully as bipolar depression can be, and its symptoms can often be relieved by electroconvulsive therapy.</p>
<p class="indent">But inherited unipolar depressions are in the minority. This raises the question of where the great number of depressions making up the epidemic in this country come from. I ask myself if human beings have undergone physical changes over the century that have made them more vulnerable to depression. Probably not. It is very doubtful that our brain chemistry or our genes have changed radically over the last two generations. So a tenfold increase in depression is not likely to be explained on biological grounds.</p>
<p class="indent">I suspect that the epidemic depression so familiar to all of us is best viewed as psychological. My guess is that most depression starts with problems in living and with specific ways of thinking about these problems. Those were my suppositions when I began my research on depression twenty years ago, but I wondered how we could prove that the cause of most depression is psychological.</p>
<p class="indent">By what psychological process do people become depressed? An analogy: How do birds fly? From the time of the ancient Greeks through the end of the nineteenth century, there had been controversies about that astounding and wonderful process. It was easy enough to watch birds fly and then concoct a theory, yet there was simply no way to know which theory was right. The question was settled once and for all in 1903, and the solution came from unexpected quarters.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="c04-nts7a"/>Wilbur and Orville Wright built an airplane and it flew. So physicists resorted to modeling, a time-honored means of settling scientific disputes. Modeling involves creating a “logical model” having the properties of the phenomenon that is mysterious—flying, for the Wrights, and depression, for us. If the logical model has all the properties of the real thing, the process by which the model works will tell you how the real thing works.</p>
<p class="indent">The Wrights’ airplane—the logical model of bird flight—took off and, <em>mirabile dictu</em>, flew. So physicists concluded birds must fly by the same process.</p>
<p class="indent">My challenge was to construct a logical model displaying all the properties of depression. This task had two parts: first, to build the model and, second, to show that it fit depression. I could see some similarities right off, but proving that they were the same thing, and that learned helplessness was a laboratory model of the real-world phenomenon called depression, was another matter.</p>
<p class="indent">Across the next twenty years, well over three hundred studies, done in many universities around the world, built the learned-helplessness model. The very first studies were done with dogs; rats soon replaced the dogs, <a id="page67"/>and finally people replaced the rats. All the studies had the same form: They were experiments with three groups of subjects. One group was allowed to bring some event or item—noise, shock, money, food—under its voluntary control. For example, a rat controlled shock by pressing a bar; each time it pressed the bar, the shock stopped. A second group—the helpless group—was “yoked” to the first and got exactly the same shock, but nothing it did mattered. Shock stopped for a rat in this group whenever the first rat pressed the bar. A third group was left entirely alone.</p>
<p class="indent">The results were consistent. The helpless group gave up. They became so passive that even in new situations, they didn’t try. Rats just sat there, not even trying to escape. People gazed at easy anagrams and made no attempt to solve them. (A sizable number of other symptoms also ensued, and I’ll discuss them later.) The group able to control events remained active and chipper, as did the group that was left alone. The rats ran briskly out of shock, and the people unscrambled the anagrams in a few seconds.</p>
<p class="indent">These simple results directly identified the source of learned helplessness. It was caused by experience in which subjects learned that nothing they did mattered and that their responses didn’t work to bring them what they wanted. This experience taught them to expect that, in the future and in new situations, their actions would once again be futile.</p>
<p class="indent">The symptoms of learned helplessness could be produced in several ways. Defeat and failure generated the same symptoms as uncontrollable events did. Being defeated in a fight by another rat produced symptoms identical to those caused by inescapable shock. Being told your job was to control noise, and then failing to do so, produced the same symptoms as unsolvable problems or inescapable noise did. So learned helplessness seemed to be at the core of defeat and failure.</p>
<p class="indent">Learned helplessness could be cured by showing the subject his own actions would now work. It could also be cured by teaching the subject to think differently about what caused him to fail. It could be prevented if, before the experience with helplessness occurred, the subject learned that his actions made a difference. The earlier in life such mastery was learned, the more effective the immunization against helplessness.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="c04-nts8a"/>Thus was the learned-helplessness theory developed, tested, and perfected. But did it serve as a model for depression? Did the laboratory model fit the real-world phenomenon? The stakes in achieving a fit were large, for when a model exists, a disorder can be deliberately created in the laboratory, which means there is a good chance its hidden mechanisms can be identified and treatments devised. If it turned out we had discovered a laboratory model for one of mankind’s oldest tormentors, depression, that would be scientific progress of a high order.</p>
<p class="indent">There was little to do to show that the principles of the Wright brothers’ <a id="page68"/>airplane flight matched those of bird flight. Their “symptoms” were patently the same: Both took off, flew, and landed. In the case of learned helplessness there was much more to do to show that the experiment reflected, point for point, all the symptoms of depression. A convincing fit is the crucial step for all laboratory models of mental illness. We needed to know whether the symptoms of learned helplessness produced in all those laboratories were the same as the symptoms depressed people had. The closer the parallel, the better the model.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s start with the toughest case: full-blown unipolar depression, like that of Sophie, the young patient I spoke of earlier in this chapter.</p>
<p class="indent">If you walk into a psychiatrist’s or psychologist’s office for help, he will soon attempt a diagnosis, and to help him do that he’ll pull out a copy of something called <em>DSM-III-R</em> (which stands for <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association</em>, third edition, revised). It is the official bible of the profession, a codification of what we know about how to diagnose mental illness. In your first interview the therapist will try to see if your symptoms let him place you in any of the categories of mental disorder.</p>
<p class="indent">Making a diagnosis by <em>DSM-III-R</em> is a little like ordering dinner from a Chinese menu. To be diagnosed as suffering a “major depressive episode” you must have five of the following nine symptoms:<br/><br/></p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li>Depressed mood</li>
<li>Loss of interest in usual activities</li>
<li>Loss of appetite</li>
<li>Insomnia</li>
<li>Psychomotor retardation (slow thought or movement)</li>
<li>Loss of energy</li>
<li>Feelings of worthlessness and guilt</li>
<li>Diminished ability to think and poor concentration</li>
<li>Suicidal thought or action<br/><br/></li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">Sophie was a good example of someone suffering a major depressive episode. She had six of the nine symptoms, lacking only suicidal thoughts, psychomotor retardation, and insomnia.</p>
<p class="indent">When we took the list of symptoms from <em>DSM-III-R</em> and applied them to the people and animals that had taken part in the learned-helplessness experiments, we found that the groups allowed to control events had none of the nine critical symptoms, but the groups not permitted to control these very same events showed no less than eight of the nine—two more than the seriously depressed Sophie had had.</p>
<div class="hanging1">
<p class="hanging"><a id="page69"/>1. People given inescapable noise or unsolvable problems reported that a <em>depressed mood</em> descended on them.</p>
<p class="hanging">2. Animals that suffered inescapable shock <em>lost interest in their usual activities</em>. They no longer competed with each other, fought back when attacked, or cared for their young.</p>
<p class="hanging">3. Animals that suffered inescapable shock <em>lost their appetites</em>. They ate less, drank less water (and more alcohol when offered it), and lost weight. They lost interest in copulation.</p>
<p class="hanging">4. Helpless animals had <em>insomnia</em>, particularly the early-morning awakening that depressed people have.</p>
<p class="hanging">5. and 6. Helpless people and animals <em>showed psychomotor retardation and lost energy</em>. They didn’t try to escape shock, get food, or solve problems. They didn’t fight back when attacked or insulted. They readily gave up on new tasks. They wouldn’t explore new environments.</p>
<p class="hanging">7. Helpless people blamed their failure to solve problems on their <em>lack of ability and worthlessness</em>. The more depressed they got, the worse was this aspect of their pessimistic explanatory style.</p>
<p class="hanging">8. Helpless people and animals <em>didn’t think very well</em> and were <em>inattentive</em>. They had extraordinary difficulty learning anything new and had trouble paying attention to the crucial cues that signal rewards or safety.</p>
</div>
<p class="extract">The only symptom we didn’t see was suicidal thought and action, and this was probably only because the laboratory failures were so minor: e.g., failure to turn off noise or solve anagrams.</p>
<p class="indent">So the fit between the model and the real-life phenomenon was exceedingly close. Inescapable noise, unsolvable problems, and inescapable shock produced eight of the nine symptoms which contribute to the diagnosis of major depression.</p>
<p class="indent">The closeness of this fit inspired researchers to test the theory still another way. A number of drugs can break up depression in people; the researchers gave all of them to the helpless animals. Again the results were dramatic: Each of the antidepressant drugs (and electroconvulsive therapy as well) cured learned helplessness in animals. They probably did so by raising the amount of crucial neurotransmitters available in the brain. The researchers also found that drugs that do not break up depression in people, like caffeine, Valium, and amphetamines, do not break up learned helplessness either.</p>
<p class="indent">The fit, then, seemed almost perfect. In its symptoms, learned helplessness produced in the laboratory seemed almost identical to depression.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page70"/>When we now looked at the upsurge of depression, we could view it as an epidemic of learned helplessness. We knew the cause of learned helplessness, and now we could see it as the cause of depression: <em>the belief that your actions will be futile</em>. This belief was engendered by defeat and failure as well as by uncontrollable situations. Depression could be caused by defeat, failure, and loss and the consequent belief that any actions taken will be futile.</p>
<p class="indent">I think this belief is at the heart of our national epidemic of depression. The modern self must be more susceptible to learned helplessness, to an ever-growing conviction that nothing one does matters. I think I know why, and I’ll discuss it in the final chapter.</p>
<p class="indent">This all sounds pretty bleak. Yet there is also a hopeful side, and this is where explanatory style becomes important.</p>
