<h1 class="chapter" id="c07"><a id="page116"/>7<br/><em>Children and Parents:<br/>      The Origins of Optimism</em></h1>
<p class="nonindent">E<span class="small">XPLANATORY STYLE</span> has a sweeping effect on the lives of adults. It can produce depression in response to everyday setbacks, or produce resilience even in the face of tragedy. It can numb a person to the pleasures of life, or allow him to live fully. It can prevent him from achieving his goals, or help him exceed them. As we will see, a person’s explanatory style influences the way other people perceive him, disposing them to work against him or with him. And it affects physical health.</p>
<p class="indent">Explanatory style develops in childhood. The optimism or pessimism developed then is fundamental. New setbacks and victories are filtered through it, and it becomes an entrenched habit of thinking. In this chapter we will ask what explanatory style’s source is, what its consequences are for children, and how it can be changed.</p>
<h3 class="section"><em>Test Your Child’s Optimism</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">If your child is over seven, he has probably developed an explanatory style, which is in the process of crystallizing. <a id="c07-nts1a"/>You can measure your child’s explanatory style with a test called the Children’s Attributional Style Questionnaire, or CASQ, which has been taken by thousands of children. The CASQ is very much like the test you took in chapter three. It takes a child <a id="page117"/>between the ages of eight and thirteen about twenty minutes to finish. If your child is older, give him the test from chapter three. For children under eight, there is no wholly reliable paper-and-pencil test, but there is another way of measuring their explanatory style, which I’ll tell you about later in this chapter.</p>
<p class="indent">To give your child the test, set aside twenty minutes, sit down at a table with him, and say something like:</p>
<div class="block">
<p class="bl_indent">“Different kids think in different ways. I’ve been reading a book about this, and I’ve been wondering how you think about some things that might happen to you.</p>
<p class="bl_indent">“Look at this. It’s really interesting. It asks you a bunch of questions about what you think. Each question is like a little story, and for each story, there are two ways you might react. You’re supposed to choose one way or the other, the one that’s closest to the way you’d really feel if that particular thing happened to you.</p>
<p class="bl_indent">“So here’s a pencil. I want you to give it a try. Imagine that each of these little stories happened to you, even if they never have. And then check either the ‘A’ answer or the ‘B’ answer—the one that best describes the way you would feel. But the great thing about this test is that there are no wrong answers! Isn’t that terrific? Now, here, let’s take a look at number one.”</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Once you get him going, your child can probably take it without any assistance. But for younger children who are not skilled readers, you should read each item aloud at the same time the child is reading it to himself.</p>

<p class="indent">You can score the test now. You can share your child’s scores with him if you like. If you do tell him what his scores are, also explain what they mean.</p>
<p class="indent">Start with the PmB (Permanent Bad) score. Total the numbers in the right-hand margin that follow the answers your child chose to questions 13, 18, 24, 28, 31, 33, 35, and 36. Enter that total in the scoring key above, next to “PmB.”</p>
<p class="indent">Then add the PmG scores—questions 5, 9, 23, 39, 40, 41, 42, and 43—and enter the total in the scoring key.</p>
<p class="indent">Then do the pervasiveness scores and note them in the key. The PvB questions are 12, 15, 20, 21, 27, 46, 47, and 48. The PvG questions are 1, 3, 17, 25, 30, 32, 34, and 37.</p>
<p class="indent">Total the PmB and PvB scores to get the hope (HoB) score. Record it.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page125"/>Now score personalization. The PsB questions are 6, 7, 10, 11, 14, 26, 29, and 38.</p>
<p class="indent">The PsG questions are 2, 4, 8, 16, 19, 22, 44, and 45.</p>
<p class="indent">Compute the total scores for bad events (PmB + PvB S + PsB) and record the Total B; then total the scores for good events (PmG + PvG + PsG) and record it.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, compute the overall scale score, G–B, by subtracting the Total B from the Total G. Write it on the bottom line of the key.</p>
<p class="indent">Here’s what your child’s scores mean and how your child compares to the thousands of children who have taken this test.</p>
<p class="indent">First, girls and boys score differently. Girls, at least up to puberty, are noticeably more optimistic than boys. The average nine-to-twelve-year-old girl has a G–B score of 7.0. The average nine-to-twelve-year-old boy has a score of 5.0. If your girl scores less than 4.5, she is somewhat pessimistic. If she scores less than 2, she is very pessimistic and at risk for depression. If your boy scores less than 2.5, he is somewhat pessimistic; less than 1, he is very pessimistic and at risk for depression.</p>
<p class="indent">As for Total B score, the average nine-to-twelve-year-old girl’s is 7.0, and the average boy’s is 8.5. Scores of three points <em>higher</em> than the average are very pessimistic.</p>
<p class="indent">The average Total G score for nine-to-twelve-year-old girls and boys is 13.5. Scores three points lower are very pessimistic. The individual good dimensions (PmG, PsG, and PvG) each average about 4.5, with scores of 3 or below being very pessimistic. The individual bad dimensions (PmB, PvB, PsG) average about 2.5 for girls and 2.8 for boys, with scores of 4 or <em>higher</em> being risk markers for depression.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c07-s01">Why Children Can’t Be Hopeless</h2>
<p class="nonindent">Y<span class="small">OU MAY HAVE</span> been surprised about the norms and what the scores mean, particularly compared to your own scores. On the whole, prepubescent children are extremely optimistic, with a capacity for hope and an immunity to hopelessness they will never again possess after puberty, when they lose much of their optimism.</p>
<p class="indent">When my son, David, was five, my wife and I divorced. Explaining it to him in euphemisms did not seem to work. He kept asking me, every weekend, if Kerry and I would get married again. The time had come for straight talk. I told him at length that people fall out of love, and that it can be final. Trying to make the point, I asked him: “Did you ever have <a id="page126"/>a friend that you used to like a lot and then stopped liking so much?”</p>
<p class="indent">“Yes,” he agreed reluctantly, searching his memory.</p>
<p class="indent">“Well, that’s the way your mother and I feel about each other. We don’t love each other anymore, and we never will again. We’ll never get married to each other again.”</p>
<p class="indent">He looked up at me, nodding agreement, and then, having the last word, concluded the discussion: “You might!”</p>
<p class="indent">Children’s explanatory style is enormously lopsided, much more so than adults’. Good events are going to last forever, are going to help in all ways, and are the child’s doing. Bad events just happen along, melt away quickly, and are someone else’s fault. So lopsided is the average child that his scores look on average like those of a successful insurance-sales agent for Metropolitan Life. A depressed child’s lopsided scores look like those of the average <em>nondepressed</em> adult’s. No one seems to have the capacity for hope that a young child does, and it is just this fact that makes severe depression in a young child stand out so tragically.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="c07-nts2a"/>Children do get depressed, and they get depressed as frequently and as profoundly as adults do, but their depression differs from adolescents’ and from adults’ in one very striking way. They do not become hopeless, and they do not commit suicide. There are between 20,000 and 50,000 suicides among adult Americans each year, almost all of which follow depression. One particular component of depression, hopelessness, is the most accurate predictor of suicide. Potential suicides strongly believe that their present misery is going to last forever and pervade all that they do, and that only death will end their suffering. Childhood suicide is tragic and on the rise now, but the approximately two hundred such suicides a year are hardly a major epidemiological problem. Children below the age of seven <em>never</em> commit suicide, even though there are well-documented homicides committed by children as young as five. Children of this age can understand death, they can understand its finality, and they can intend to kill someone; but what they cannot do is sustain a state of hopelessness for very long.</p>
<p class="indent">Evolution, I believe, has ensured this. The child carries the seed of the future, and nature’s primary interest in children is that they reach puberty safely and produce the next generation of children. Nature has buffered our children not only physically—prepubescent children have the lowest death rate from all causes—but psychologically as well, by endowing them with hope, abundant and irrational.</p>
<p class="indent">But for all this buffering against hopelessness, some children are much more predisposed to pessimism and depression than others. The CASQ is a good indicator of who is vulnerable and who is protected. Children who score in the optimistic half—boys above 5.5 and girls above 7.5—will tend <a id="page127"/>to become optimistic teenagers and adults. They will, on average, have less depression, achieve more, and be healthier over their lives than children who score below these averages.</p>
<p class="indent">Explanatory style sets in early. We see it in quite crystallized form in children as young as eight. If your child already has an optimistic or pessimistic stance about the world by the third grade, and if it is going to be so important to his future, his health and success, you may wonder where it came from and what you can do to change it.</p>
<p class="indent">There are three major hypotheses about the origins of explanatory style. The first concerns the child’s mother.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c07-s01-s01"><em>(1) Mother’s Explanatory Style:</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">L<span class="small">ISTEN IN</span> as Sylvia reacts to a bad event in the presence of her eight-year-old daughter Marjorie. The scene begins as they get into a car at a shopping-center parking lot. As you listen, try to discern Sylvia’s explanatory style.</p>
<div class="block">
<p class="bl_hanging">Marjorie: Mommy, there’s a dent on my side of the car.</p>
<p class="bl_hanging">Sylvia: Damn, Bob will kill me!</p>
<p class="bl_hanging">Marjorie: Daddy told you to always park his new car far away from the other cars.</p>
<p class="bl_hanging">Sylvia: Damn, things like this always happen to me. I’m so lazy, I just want to carry groceries a few feet, not a hundred yards. I’m so stupid.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Sylvia is saying some pretty disheartening things about herself, and Marjorie is listening very carefully. It’s not only the content that’s disheartening but the form. In content, Marjorie hears that Sylvia is in big trouble, and that she’s stupid, lazy, and chronically unlucky. Bad enough. But the form of what Sylvia says is even worse.</p>
<p class="indent">Marjorie can hear that it’s a bad event that is being explained. Sylvia gives Marjorie (quite inadvertently) four explanations:</p>
<p class="indent">1. <em>“Things like this always happen to me.”</em> That explanation is permanent: Sylvia uses <em>always</em>. Pervasive, too: “Things like this,” not “car dents”; Sylvia doesn’t qualify the misfortune or set any boundaries for the troubles that always happen to her. And personal: They “happen to <em>me,”</em> not to everyone. Sylvia singles herself out as a victim.</p>
<p class="indent">2. <em>“I’m so lazy.”</em> Laziness, as Sylvia has cast it, is a permanent character trait. (Contrast Sylvia’s explanation with this one: “I was feeling lazy.”) <a id="page128"/>Laziness hurts in many circumstances, and thus is pervasive. And Sylvia has personalized it.</p>
<p class="indent">3. <em>“I want to carry groceries a few feet”</em>—personal, permanent (not “I wanted”), but not particularly pervasive since it’s just about physical labor.</p>
<p class="indent">4. <em>“I’m so stupid”</em>—permanent, pervasive, personal.</p>
<p class="indent">You weren’t the only one who did an analysis of what Sylvia was saying. Marjorie did, too. Marjorie has heard her mother explain a crisis by giving four highly pessimistic causes. She has heard her mother’s view that bad events are permanent, pervasive, and her own fault. Marjorie is learning that this is the way the world is.</p>
<p class="indent">Every day Marjorie hears her mother make permanent, pervasive, and personal analyses of the untoward events that happen around the house. Marjorie is in the process of learning from the most influential person in her life that bad events are going to last, are going to hurt everything, and are appropriately blamed on the person to whom they happen. Marjorie is forming a theory of the world in which bad events have permanent, pervasive, and personal causes.</p>
<p class="indent">Children’s antennae are constantly tuned to the way their parents, particularly their mothers, talk about causes of emotionally loaded events. It is no accident that “Why?” is one of the first and most repeated questions that young children ask. Getting explanations for the world around them, particularly the social world, is the prime intellectual task of growing up. Once the parents get impatient and stop answering the never-ending <em>why</em> questions, children get their answers in other ways. Mostly they listen closely when you spontaneously explain why things happen—which you do, on average, about once a minute during speech. Your children hang on every word of the explanations you give, particularly when something goes wrong. Not only do they listen for the particulars of what you say, but they listen keenly to its formal properties: whether the cause you cite is permanent or temporary, specific or pervasive, your fault or someone else’s.</p>
<p class="indent">The way your mother talked about the world to you when you were a child had a marked influence on your explanatory style. We found out about this by giving explanatory-style questionnaires to one hundred children and their parents. The mother’s level of optimism and the child’s level were very similar. This was true of both sons and daughters. We were surprised to find that neither the children’s style nor the mother’s style bore any resemblance to the father’s style. This tells us that young children listen to what their primary caretaker (usually their mother) says about causes, and they tend to make this style their own. If the child has an optimistic mother, this is great, but it can be a disaster for the child if the child has a pessimistic mother.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page129"/>These findings raise a question: Is explanatory style genetic? Can we inherit it from our parents, as we seem to inherit a disconcertingly large portion of our intelligence, our politics, and our religious outlook? (Studies of identical twins reared separately show that they both grow up to have uncannily similar political outlooks, belief in God or lack of it, and IQs.) Unlike these psychological traits, the pattern of explanatory style that we find in families suggests that it is <em>not</em> heritable: The mother’s is similar to both the sons’ and the daughters’; the father’s is similar to no one’s. This is a pattern of results that does not fit any ordinary genetic model.</p>
<p class="indent">To be sure, we are now trying to ask the genetic question less indirectly. We will measure the optimism of both the biological and the adoptive parents of children who were adopted when very young. If the children’s level of optimism is similar to that of the adoptive parents and dissimilar to that of the biological parents, this will confirm our view that the origins of optimism are learned. If the children’s level of optimism resembles the level of the biological parents, whom the children have never met, this would show that optimism can be at least partly inherited.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c07-s01-s02"><em>(2) Adult Criticism: Teachers and Parents</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">W<span class="small">HEN YOUR CHILDREN</span> do something wrong, what do you say to them? What do their teachers say to them? As noted, children listen carefully not just to content but to form, not just to what adults say to them but <em>how</em> adults say it. This is particularly true of criticisms. Children believe the criticisms they get, and use them to form their explanatory style.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="c07-nts3a"/>Let’s look for a minute into a typical third-grade classroom, as Carol Dweck, one of the world’s leading researchers into emotional development, has done. Carol’s work has illuminated how optimism develops. It may also give us clues about what happens during the childhood of women that makes them far more susceptible to depression than men are.</p>
<p class="indent">Once the class gets used to your presence and settles down, the first thing you notice is a striking difference between the demeanor of the girls and that of the boys. The girls are for the most part a pleasure for the teacher: They sit quietly, even fold their hands, and they appear to listen attentively. When they act up, they whisper and giggle, but basically they obey the rules. The boys are a pain. They fidget even when trying to sit still—which they don’t try all that often. They don’t appear to listen, they don’t obey the rules as scrupulously as the girls do. When they act up—which is a lot of the time—they shout and run around.</p>
<p class="indent">The class buckles down and takes a test on fractions. What does the teacher say to the children who do badly on the test? What kind of criticisms <a id="page130"/>do boys and girls hear from their teachers in the third grade when they fail?</p>
<p class="indent">The boys who fail are typically told: “You weren’t paying attention,” “You didn’t try hard enough,” “You were being rowdy when I was teaching fractions.” What kinds of explanations are not paying attention, little effort, and rowdiness? They are temporary and specific, not pervasive. Temporary because you can change how much effort you put out, and you can pay attention if you want, and you can stop being rowdy. Boys hear temporary and specific causes invoked to explain why their school performance wasn’t up to par.</p>
<p class="indent">The girls, Dweck’s studies reveal, routinely hear quite a different sort of condemnation. Since they aren’t rowdy and they look as if they are paying attention, they can’t be criticized on those grounds. For the teacher correcting them, this leaves “You’re not very good at arithmetic,” “You always hand in sloppy papers,” “You never check your work.” Most of the temporary causes, such as inattention, not trying, and misbehaving, are ruled out, so girls are barraged with permanent and pervasive criticisms of their failure. What do they distill out of their third-grade experience?</p>
<p class="indent">Carol Dweck found out by taking fourth-grade girls and giving them impossible problems to solve. Then she looked at how they explained their failures.</p>
<p class="indent">They all got scrambled words to find anagrams for—“ZOLT,” “IEOF,” “MAPE,” and so on—but their effort was in vain, because it was impossible to rearrange the letters to form a real word. All the children tried hard, but before they could exhaust the possible combinations, they were told, “Time’s up.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Why didn’t you solve those?” the experimenter asked.</p>
<p class="indent">The girls said things like “I’m not very good at word games” and “I guess I’m not very bright.”</p>
<p class="indent">The boys, when they were given the same test, said things like “I wasn’t paying attention”; and “I didn’t try very hard”; “Who cares about your lousy puzzles anyway?”</p>
<p class="indent">In this test, the girls gave permanent and pervasive explanations for their failures; the boys, on the other hand, gave much more hopeful explanations—temporary, specific, and changeable. What we see here is the impact of the second influence on your child’s explanatory style: the criticisms that adults make when the child fails. Again, the child listens attentively, and if what he hears is permanent and pervasive—“You’re stupid”; “You’re no good”—this finds its way into his theory of himself. If what he hears is temporary and specific—“You didn’t try hard enough”; “These puzzles are for sixth-graders”—he sees problems as solvable and local.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c07-s01-s03"><a id="page131"/><em>(3) Children’s Life Crises</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent"><a id="c07-nts4a"/>I<span class="small">N</span> H<span class="small">EIDELBERG</span> in 1981, I heard Glen Elder, the world’s leading sociologist of the family, give a talk to a group of researchers interested in how children grow up under tremendous adversity. He told us about a fascinating study he had been working on his whole adult life. Two generations ago, he said, before the Great Depression, a group of visionary scientists, Glen’s predecessors, launched a study about growing up that has gone on for almost sixty years. A group of children from two California cities, Berkeley and Oakland, were interviewed and tested thoroughly for their psychological strengths and weaknesses. These test subjects are now in their seventies and eighties. They have continued to cooperate with this landmark study of life-span development. Not only that but their children, and now their grandchildren, have participated as well.</p>
<p class="indent">Glen then talked about who survived the Great Depression intact and who never recovered. He told the spellbound group that middle-class girls whose families lost all their money recovered psychologically by early middle age and then aged well both physically and psychologically. Lower-class girls who were equally deprived during the 1930s never recovered. They fell apart in late middle age, and their old age was tragic, both physically and psychologically.</p>
<p class="indent">Glen speculated about the cause.</p>
<p class="indent">“I believe that the women who aged well,” he said, “learned during their childhood in the Great Depression that adversity would be overcome. After all, most of their families recovered economically during the late 1930s and early 1940s. That recovery taught them optimism, and this crisis and its resolution shaped their explanatory style for bad events, making it temporary, specific, and external. This means that in old age, when their best friend died, they thought, ‘I will find friendship elsewhere.’ This optimistic outlook … helped their health and their aging.</p>
<p class="indent">“Contrast the girls from lower-class families. By and large, their families did not recover after the Great Depression. They were poor before it, during it, and after it. They learned pessimism. They learned that when troubles strike, hard times remain forever. Their explanatory style became hopeless. Much later, when their best friend died, they thought, ‘I’ll never find friendship again.’ This pessimism, learned in childhood from the reality of their situation, got imposed on every new crisis, and undermined their health, their achievement, and their sense of well-being.</p>
<p class="indent">“These are wild speculations, though,” Glen said in closing. “Nobody had thought of the notion of explanatory style fifty years ago, so it wasn’t <a id="page132"/>measured. It’s too bad we don’t have a time machine, so we could go back to 1930 and find out if my speculations are right.”</p>
<p class="indent">I couldn’t sleep that night. “It’s too bad we don’t have a time machine” kept running through my head. At five in the morning, I was pounding on Glen’s door.</p>
<p class="indent">“Wake up, Glen, we have to talk. I <em>do</em> have a time machine!”</p>
<p class="indent">Glen dragged himself out of bed and we went for a walk.</p>
<p class="indent">“Last year,” I said to Glen, “I got a letter from a remarkable young social psychologist named Chris Peterson. It read like an academic fortune cookie. ‘Help,’ it said, ‘I am trapped at a small college teaching eight courses a year. Have creative ideas, will travel.’ I invited him to spend a couple of years working with me at Penn, and he did, indeed, have creative ideas.”</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="c07-nts5a"/><a id="link100"/>The most creative idea Chris had concerned how to determine the explanatory style of people who wouldn’t take explanatory-style questionnaires—people like sports heroes, presidents, and movie stars. Chris read the sports pages indefatigably, and every time he found a causal statement made by a football player, he treated it as if it was an item on an explanatory-style questionnaire filled out by the player. So, if a kicker said that he missed the field goal because “The wind was against me,” Chris rated that quote for its permanent, pervasive, and personal qualities, on a 1-to-7 scale. “The wind was against me” would get only a <em>1</em> for permanent, since nothing is less permanent than wind; about a <em>1</em> for pervasive, since the wind being against you only hurts kicking and not your love life; and a 1 for personal, since the wind is not the kicker’s fault. “The wind was against me” is a very optimistic explanation of a bad event.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="link900"/>Chris then averaged the ratings over all the causal statements the kicker made and got the kicker’s explanatory style, without using a questionnaire. Next we showed that such a profile roughly matches what would have happened if the questionnaire had been taken by the kicker. We called this the CAVE—for content analysis of verbatim explanations—technique.</p>
<p class="indent">“Glen,” I went on, “the CAVE technique <em>is</em> the time machine. We can use it not only on contemporary people who won’t take questionnaires, but on people who <em>can’t</em> take questionnaires, like the dead.</p>
<p class="indent">“This brings me to why I woke you up. Did your predecessors save the original interviews with the Berkeley-Oakland children from the 1930s?”</p>
<p class="indent">Glen thought for a bit. “That was before the tape recorder was in wide use, but I seem to recall that the interviewers took shorthand notes. I can check it when I get back to my archives.”</p>
<p class="indent">“If we still have authentic quotes,” I said, “we can use the CAVE technique on them. Every time one of the children made a causal statement, <a id="page133"/>we can treat it as an item from an explanatory style questionnaire, and we can have raters—who are blind to the source of the quotes—score them for optimism. At the end of the process, we’d know what each child’s explanatory style was fifty years ago. We can travel back in time and test your speculations.”</p>
<p class="indent">When he got back to the Berkeley archives, Glen checked. There did indeed exist verbatim notes from the early interviews, and complete interviews done at various points later in life, as the young girls became mothers and then grandmothers. We used these notes and interviews to create explanatory-style profiles for these women. We extracted every causal statement from the interviews, gave each statement to raters who did not know its source, and had them rate it on the 1-to-7 scale for pervasiveness, permanence, and personalization.</p>
<p class="indent">Glen’s speculation was largely correct. The middle-class women, who aged well, tended to be optimists. The lower-class women, who aged badly, tended to be pessimists.</p>
<p class="indent">This first use of the time machine accomplished three things.</p>
<p class="indent">First, the time machine provided us with an extremely powerful tool. We could now use this tool to ask about the optimism of people who would not take questionnaires, as long as we had verbatim quotes from them. We could “CAVE” an enormous range of material for explanatory style: press conferences, diaries, therapy transcripts, letters home from the battlefront, wills. We could find out the explanatory style of children too young to take the CASQ by listening to them talk, extracting their causal statements and rating them as if they were questionnaire items. We might be able to find out how optimistic long-dead presidents of the United States had been, whether the level of optimism has increased or decreased over historical time in America, and whether some cultures and religions are more pessimistic than others.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, the time machine gave us additional evidence that we learn our explanatory style from our mothers. In 1970 the Berkeley-Oakland children, now grandmothers, were interviewed. In addition their children, now mothers themselves, were also interviewed. We “CAVEd” these interviews and found the same results that our questionnaire studies showed. There was marked resemblance between the level of pessimism of the mothers and their daughters. As noted above, this is one of the ways we learn optimism, by listening to our mothers explain the everyday events that happen to them.</p>
<p class="indent">Third, the time machine provided our first evidence that the reality of the crises we go through as children shapes our optimism: Girls who went through economic crises that were resolved came to look at bad events as <a id="page134"/>temporary and changeable. But children who experienced the privations of the Great Depression and remained poor afterward came to look at bad events as fixed and immutable. So our major childhood crises may give us a pattern, like a cookie cutter, with which, for the rest of our lives, we produce explanations for new crises.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="c07-nts6a"/>In addition to the findings of the work with Glen Elder, there is another line of evidence for the proposition that children distill their explanatory style out of major crises in their lives. This evidence has been painstakingly gathered by British professor George Brown. When I first met him, George had spent the last ten years walking around the most poverty-stricken areas of South London, interviewing housewives at great length. He had interviewed more than four hundred, looking for the key to the prevention of depression. The sheer amount of severe depression he uncovered was shocking—over 20 percent of the housewives were depressed, half of those psychotically so. What, he was determined to find out, separated those women who got severely depressed in that trying environment from those who were invulnerable?</p>
<p class="indent">He had isolated three protective factors. If any single one of the three was present, depression would not occur, even in the face of severe loss and privation. The first protective factor was an intimate relationship with a spouse or a lover. Such women could fight depression off well. The second was a job outside the home. The third was not having three or more children under the age of fourteen at home to take care of.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to invulnerability factors, Brown had isolated two major risk factors for depression: recent loss (husband dying, son emigrating) and, more important, <em>death of their own mothers before the women had reached their teens</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">“If your mother dies when you are young,” George explained, “you think about later losses in the most hopeless ways. When your son emigrates to New Zealand, you don’t say to yourself that he’s gone off to make his fortune and he’ll be coming back. You see him as dead. All adult losses seem to you to be deaths.”</p>
<p class="indent">The death of the mother of a young girl is a permanent and pervasive loss. So much of what a girl does depends on her mother. This is true particularly before puberty—before boys and the daughter’s teenage crowd become partial substitutes. If the reality of our first major loss shapes how we think about the causes of future losses, George’s findings make sense. These unfortunate children learn—just as the lower-class children did during the Great Depression—that loss is permanent and pervasive. Their mother leaves and never comes back, and their whole life is now impoverished. Losses later in life get interpreted this way: He’s dead, he’s never coming back, I can’t go on.</p>
<p class="center"><a id="page135"/>• • •</p>
<p class="nonindent">S<span class="small">O WE HAVE</span> evidence for three kinds of influences on your child’s explanatory style. First, the form of the everyday causal analyses he hears from you—especially if you are his mother: If yours are optimistic, his will be too. Second, the form of the criticisms he hears when he fails: If they are permanent and pervasive, his view of himself will turn toward pessimism. Third, the reality of his early losses and traumas: If they remit, he will develop the theory that bad events can be changed and conquered. But if they are, in fact, permanent and pervasive, the seeds of hopelessness have been deeply planted.</p>
