<h1 class="chapter" id="itr"><em>Introduction to the Second Edition</em></h1>
<h1 class="subchapter">by Martin E. P. Seligman</h1>
<p class="nonindent">I have spent my entire professional life working on helplessness and ways to enlarge personal control. <em>Learned Optimism</em> was the first of a quartet of books to explore this theme for the general reader.<a class="hlink" href="#itr-ftn1" id="itr-ftn1a"><sup class="frac">1</sup></a> Six years have passed since the first paperback edition of this book was published, so I wanted to bring my new readers up to date with news about a crucial development since the first edition—the prevention of depression by programs of learned optimism.</p>
<p class="indent">As you will see in <a class="hlink" href="Seli_9780307803344_epub_c04_r1.htm">Chapters 4</a> and <a class="hlink" href="Seli_9780307803344_epub_c05_r1.htm">5</a>, our nation, and most of the developed world, is experiencing an unprecedented epidemic of depression—particularly among young people. Why is it that in a nation that has more money, more power, more records, more books, and more education, that depression should be so much more prevalent than it was when the nation was less prosperous and less powerful?</p>
<p class="indent">Three forces have now converged, and I want to emphasize the third because it is the most surprising and least congenial. The first two forces are discussed in the concluding chapter of this book: briefly, the first is that, in general, depression is a disorder of the “I,” failing in your own eyes relative to your goals. In a society in which individualism is becoming rampant, people more and more believe that they are the center of the world. Such a belief system makes individual failure almost inconsolable.</p>
<p class="indent">Individual failure used to be buffered by the second force, the large “we.” When our grandparents failed, they had comfortable spiritual furniture to rest in. They had, for the most part, their relationship to God, their relationship to a nation they loved, their relationship to a community and a large extended family. Faith in God, community, nation, and the large extended family have all eroded in the last forty years, and the spiritual furniture that we used to sit in has become threadbare.</p>
<p class="indent">But it is the third force, the self-esteem movement, that I want to emphasize. I have five children who range in age from four to twenty-eight. So I have had the privilege of reading children’s books every night for a whole generation, and I have seen a sea change in children’s books over the last twenty-five years. Twenty-five years ago (as it was during the time of the Great Depression), the emblematic children’s book was <em>The Little Engine That Could</em>. It is about doing well in the world, about persisting and therefore overcoming obstacles. Now many children’s books are about feeling good, having high self-esteem, and exuding confidence.</p>
<p class="indent">This is a manifestation of the self-esteem movement, a movement which started, not surprisingly, in California in the 1960s. In 1990, the California legislature sponsored a report that suggested that self-esteem be taught in every classroom as a “vaccine” against social ills, such as drug addiction, suicide, welfare dependency, teenage pregnancy, and depression (Toward a State of Esteem, 1990).<a class="hlink" href="#itr-ftn2" id="itr-ftn2a"><sup class="frac">2</sup></a> The self-esteem movement is a movement with teeth; this is the movement underlying the demise of IQ testing, lest children who score low feel badly about themselves. This is the movement underlying the end of tracking in our public schools, lest kids of lower tracks feel badly about themselves. This is the movement that has made <em>competition</em> a dirty word. This is a movement that has led to less plain old hard work. Shirley McLaine suggested to President Clinton that he create a cabinet-level Secretary of Self-Esteem.</p>
<p class="indent">I am not against self-esteem, but I believe that self-esteem is just a meter that reads out the state of the system. It is not an end in itself. When you are doing well in school or work, when you are doing well with the people you love, when you are doing well in play, the meter will register high. When you are doing badly, it will register low. I have scoured the self-esteem literature looking for the causality as opposed to correlation, looking for any evidence that high self-esteem among youngsters <em>causes</em> better grades, more popularity, less teenage pregnancy, less dependence on welfare, as the California report contends. There is a simple experimental design which perfectly separates cause from correlation: Take a group of children in September, all the B students, for instance; measure their self-esteem and then come back in June. If self-esteem <em>causes</em> grades to change, the B students with high self-esteem will tend to go up toward A’s, and the B students with low self-esteem will go down toward C’s. There is nothing of this sort to be found in the literature. Self-esteem seems only to be a symptom, a correlate, of how well a person is doing in the world.</p>
<p class="indent">Until January 1996, I believed that self-esteem was merely a meter with little, if any, causal efficacy. The lead article in the <em>Psychological Review</em> convinced me that I was wrong, and that self-esteem is causal: Roy Baumeister and his colleagues (1996)<a class="hlink" href="#itr-ftn3" id="itr-ftn3a"><sup class="frac">3</sup></a> reviewed the literature on genocidal killers, on hit men, on gang leaders, and on violent criminals. They argued that these perpetrators have high self-esteem, and that their unwarranted self-esteem causes violence. Baumeister’s work suggests that if you teach unwarrantedly high self-esteem to children, problems will ensue. A sub-group of these children will also have a mean streak in them. When these children confront the real world, and it tells them they are not as great as they have been taught, they will lash out with violence. So it is possible that the twin epidemics among young people in the United States today, depression and violence, both come from this misbegotten concern: valuing how our young people feel about themselves more highly than how we value how well they are doing in the world.</p>
<p class="indent">If boosting self-esteem is not the answer to curbing the epidemic of depression, what can be done? Since the first edition of <em>Learned Optimism</em> was published, my colleagues<a class="hlink" href="#itr-ftn4" id="itr-ftn4a"><sup class="frac">4</sup></a> and I have been doing two sets of projects at the University of Pennsylvania: one with young adults, Penn freshman; and the second with children right before puberty.</p>
<p class="indent">Our logic is to take young people at risk for depression, teach them the skills of learned optimism that you will read about in <a class="hlink" href="Seli_9780307803344_epub_c11_r1.htm">Chapters 11</a>–<a class="hlink" href="Seli_9780307803344_epub_c13_r1.htm">13</a> of this book, and ask if we can thereby prevent depressive and anxiety disorders. Starting in the spring of 1991, when students accepted their admissions to the University of Pennsylvania, they then got a letter from me by return mail. It asked them to take a questionnaire, a version of which is included in <a class="hlink" href="Seli_9780307803344_epub_c03_r1.htm">Chapter 3</a>. Most of them sent the questionnaire back filled out. We scored it, and then students in the bottom quarter of pessimism got another letter from me saying that when they arrived in September, we were going to be running workshops about how to cope with this unfamiliar new environment; if they were willing, they would be randomized either into a control group or into one of these workshops. So for the last several years, the most pessimistic quarter of Penn’s freshman class has been in these workshops, or has been in our assessment-only control group.</p>
<p class="indent">We teach two sets of skills in the workshop, conducted in groups of ten by Penn’s talented clinical psychology graduate students: We teach people the skills detailed in <a class="hlink" href="Seli_9780307803344_epub_c11_r1.htm">Chapters 11</a>–<a class="hlink" href="Seli_9780307803344_epub_c13_r1.htm">13</a>, and an additional set of behavioral skills, including assertive training, graded task assignment, and stress management.</p>
<p class="indent">After eighteen months of follow-up, I can report our first results with 119 people in the control group, and 106 who took the 16-hour learned-optimism workshop. Every six months each person had a complete diagnostic interview, and we looked at moderate and severe episodes of depression and anxiety. Thirty-two percent of the students in the control group had a moderate to severe episode of depression, in contrast to 22 percent of the group that was in the preventive workshop. Similar results were obtained for generalized anxiety disorder: 15 percent of the controls had an episode of generalized anxiety disorder, versus only 7 percent of people who took the workshop. We also found that it was the change from pessimism to optimism that caused the prevention of depression and anxiety.</p>
<p class="indent">My colleagues and I have recently launched the parallel learned-optimism program with schoolchildren of various ages.<a class="hlink" href="#itr-ftn5" id="itr-ftn5a"><sup class="frac">5</sup></a> Five studies teach ten- to twelve-year-old children the cognitive and behavioral anti-depression skills from <a class="hlink" href="Seli_9780307803344_epub_c11_r1.htm">Chapters 11</a>–<a class="hlink" href="Seli_9780307803344_epub_c13_r1.htm">13</a> in this book. In these studies we select children for two risk factors: one is mild symptoms of depression, and the other is their parents’ fighting a lot. Each of these factors predicts depression in young children. If a child scores high on either of these, the child is then eligible for our training program. Anti-depression skills are taught to groups of ten children after school, using skits, cartoons, role playing, and lots of refreshments. (You will find the methods outlined in <a class="hlink" href="Seli_9780307803344_epub_c13_r1.htm">Chapter 13</a>, and detailed in <em>The Optimistic Child.)</em></p>
<p class="indent">I will tell you about only one study here, the one with longest follow-up. It was done in Abington Township, near Philadelphia (Jaycox, Reivich, Gillham and Seligman, 1994; Gillham, Reivich, Jaycox, and Seligman, 1996).<a class="hlink" href="#itr-ftn6" id="itr-ftn6a"><sup class="frac">6</sup></a> The findings of the Abington study revealed the following:</p>
<div class="block">
<p class="bl_indent">1. Over the two-year follow-up, the overall percentage of children who show symptoms in the moderate to severe range of depression is shockingly high (between 20 percent and 45 percent).</p>
<p class="bl_indent">2. The children who took the optimism workshop had only about half the rate of moderate or severe depressive symptoms as the control group.</p>
<p class="bl_indent">3. Immediately after the workshop, the untreated group had significantly more depressive symptoms than the group that took the optimism workshop.</p>
<p class="bl_indent">4. The benefits of learned optimism grow over time. As the children in the control group went through puberty, got their first social and sexual rejections, and moved from top dog in middle school to the bottom of the heap in high school, they got more and more depressed when compared to children in the optimism group. At twenty-four months forty-four percent of them had moderate to severe depressive symptoms, whereas only twenty two percent of the optimism group have moderate or severe symptoms.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Teaching children learned optimism before puberty, but late enough in childhood so that they are metacognitive (capable of thinking about thinking), is a fruitful strategy. When the immunized children use these skills to cope with the first rejections of puberty, they get better and better at using these skills. Our analysis shows that the change from pessimism to optimism is at least partly responsible for the prevention of depressive symptoms.</p>
<p class="indent">As you read this book, you will see that there is an epidemic of depression among adults and among children in the United States today. As <a class="hlink" href="Seli_9780307803344_epub_c06_r1.htm">Chapters 6</a>–<a class="hlink" href="Seli_9780307803344_epub_c10_r1.htm">10</a> document, depression is not just about mental suffering; it is also about lowered productivity and worsened physical health. If this epidemic continues, I believe that America’s place in the world will be in jeopardy. America will lose its economic place to less pessimistic nations than ours, and this pessimism will sap our will to bring about social justice in our own country.</p>
<p class="indent">This problem will not be ended by Prozac. We are not going to give anti-depressant drugs to an entire generation. Anti-depressant drugs are ineffective before puberty, and there are grave moral dangers to making an entire generation dependent on drugs for their mood and their productivity. We are also not going to do therapy with an entire generation, because there are simply not enough good therapists to go around.</p>
<p class="indent">What we can do is to take the skills that you will learn in this book and translate them into an educative mode. In the schools and homes of America, we can teach them to all young people at risk for depression, thereby overcoming depression in our own lives, and in the lives of our children.</p>
