<h1 class="chapter" id="c05"><a id="page71"/>5<br/><em>How You Think, How You Feel</em></h1>
<p class="nonindent">I<span class="small">F</span> S<span class="small">OPHIE</span> had suffered her depression twenty years ago, she would have been out of luck. She would have had to wait until the depression ran its course—months, even a year or more. But because she became depressed within the last decade, she stood a much better chance, for in the last ten years a treatment has been developed that works quickly and well. Its discoverers were a psychologist, Albert Ellis, and a psychiatrist, Aaron T. Beck. When the history of modern psychotherapy is written, I believe their names will appear on the short list with Freud and Jung. Together they took the mystery out of depression. They showed us it was much simpler and more curable than it was thought to be.</p>
<p class="indent">Before Ellis and Beck spun their theories, it was dogma that all depression was manic-depressive illness. There were two opposing theories of manic-depression illness: The biomedical school held that it was a disease of the body; the alternative was Freud’s notion that depression was anger turned upon the self. Dutifully incorporating this insidious bit of nonsense into their treatment of patients, the Freudians urged depressives to let all their emotions hang out—with the common result of increased depression and even suicide.</p>
<p class="indent">Ellis was a very different apostle of letting it all hang out. After getting his Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1947, Ellis undertook a private practice in psychotherapy, specializing in marriage and family therapy. Perhaps stirred by his patients’ disclosures, he soon launched what became a lifelong campaign against sexual repression. He began writing book after book with titles like <em>If This Be Sexual Heresy, The Case for Sexual Liberty</em>, and <em>The Civilized Couple’s Guide to Extramarital Adventure</em>. Quite naturally <a id="page72"/>Ellis became a charter member of, and guru to, the Kerouac generation, providing its rationale. I first came across his work in the early 1960s when, as a Princeton sophomore, I helped organize a student program on sexuality. Ellis, invited to speak, proposed some such title as “Masturbate Now” for his presentation. The president of Princeton, usually a man of unflappable fairness, had him disinvited.</p>
<p class="indent">Many colleagues viewed Ellis as an embarrassment, but others recognized that he was endowed with an extraordinary clinical sense. When his patients were talking, he was listening acutely and thinking hard and iconoclastically. By the 1970s he had taken his charisma and his directness into the field of depression, an area filled with nearly as much prejudice and misconception as sexuality was. Depression was never the same again.</p>
<p class="indent">Ellis was as outrageous in his new field as he’d been in the old. Gaunt and angular, always in motion, he sounded like a (very effective) vacuum-cleaner salesman. With patients, he pushed and pushed until he had persuaded them to give up the irrational beliefs that sustained their depression. “What do you mean you can’t live without love?” he would cry. “Utter nonsense. Love comes rarely in life, and if you waste your life mooning over its all too ordinary absence, you are bringing on your own depression. You are living under a tyranny of <em>should</em>’s. Stop ‘should-ing’ on yourself!”</p>
<p class="indent">Ellis believed that what others thought of as deep neurotic conflict was simply bad thinking—“stupid behavior on the part of nonstupid people,” he called it—and in a loud, propagandistic way (he called himself a counterpropagandist) he would demand that his patients stop thinking wrong and start thinking right. Surprisingly, most of his patients got better. Ellis successfully challenged the hallowed belief that mental illness is an enormously intricate, even mysterious phenomenon, curable only when deep unconscious conflicts are brought to light or a medical illness is rooted out. In the complexified world of psychology, this stripped-down approach came off as revolutionary.</p>
<p class="indent">Meanwhile, Beck, a Freudian psychiatrist with immense clinical gifts, was also having trouble with the orthodox approach. Beck and Ellis couldn’t have contrasted more sharply. Ellis’s manner was Trotskyite, Beck’s was Socratic. A friendly, folksy man with a cherubic face and the look of a New England country doctor, given to wearing red bow ties, Beck conveyed gentleness and bedrock common sense. Haranguing patients was not his style. He would listen carefully, softly question, mildly persuade.</p>
<p class="indent">Like Ellis, Beck found himself intensely frustrated in the 1960s because of the stranglehold the Freudian and biomedical views had on the treatment of depression. After his medical studies at Yale, he spent years as a conventional <a id="page73"/>analyst, waiting for the lonely figure on the couch to come up with some insight about his depression: how he had been turning his anger on himself instead of expressing it, and how depression had resulted. Beck’s wait was rarely rewarded. He had then tried treating groups of depressives, encouraging them to give vent to their anger and their sadness rather than holding them in. This was worse than unrewarding. Depressives would unravel before his eyes, and he could not easily knit them up again.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1966, when I met Tim Beck (his middle name is Temkin and his friends call him Tim), he was writing his first book about depression. His common sense had asserted itself. He had decided he would merely describe what a depressed person consciously thinks and leave to others the deep theorizing about where these thoughts come from. Depressives think awful things about themselves and their future. Maybe that’s all there is to depression, Tim reasoned. Maybe what looks like a symptom of depression—negative thinking—<em>is</em> the disease. Depression, he argued courageously, is neither bad brain chemistry nor anger turned inward. It is a disorder of conscious thought.</p>
<p class="indent">With this battle cry, Tim lit into the Freudians. “<a id="c05-nts1a"/>The troubled person,” he wrote, “is led to believe that he can’t help himself and must seek out a professional healer when confronted with distress related to everyday problems of living. His confidence in using the ‘obvious’ techniques he has customarily used in solving his problems is eroded because he accepts the view that emotional disturbances arise from forces beyond his grasp. He can’t hope to understand himself through his own efforts, because his own notions are dismissed as shallow and insubstantial. By debasing the value of common sense, this subtle indoctrination inhibits him from using his own judgment in analyzing and solving his problems.”</p>
<p class="indent">Tim liked to quote a remark by the great mathematician and philosopher Alfred North Whitehead: “Science is rooted in … common sense thought. That is the datum from which it starts, and to which it must recur.… You may polish up common sense, you may contradict it in detail, you may surprise it. But ultimately your whole task is to satisfy it.”</p>
<p class="indent">A progenitor of this revolution in psychology, also today in his seventies, was Joseph Wolpe. A psychiatrist in South Africa and a born dissenter (his own brother, a leading South African Communist, had been persecuted and jailed), Wolpe had chosen to confront the psychoanalytic establishment. In South Africa, that was almost like opposing apartheid, such was psychoanalysis’s grip on the profession. In the 1950s Wolpe astounded the therapeutic world, and infuriated his colleagues, by finding a simple cure for phobias. The psychoanalytic establishment held that a phobia—an irrational and intense fear of certain objects, such as cats—was just a surface <a id="page74"/>manifestation of a deeper, underlying disorder. The phobia’s source, it was said, was the buried fear that your father would castrate you in retaliation for your lust for your mother. (No alternative mechanism is suggested for women. Remarkably, Freudians never paid much attention to the fact that the vast majority of phobics are women, and therefore lack the genital configuration required by their theory.) The biomedical theorists, on the other hand, claimed that there must be some, as yet undiscovered, disordered brain chemistry that was the underlying problem. (Even now, forty years later, this malfunction of brain chemistry has not been found.) Both groups insisted that to treat only the patient’s fear of cats would do no more good than it would to put rouge over measles.</p>
<p class="indent">Wolpe, however, reasoned that irrational fear of something isn’t just a symptom of a phobia; it’s the whole phobia. If the fear could be removed (and it could, through various Pavlovian extinction procedures involving punishment and reward), that would extinguish the phobia. If you could get rid of your fear of cats, the problem would be solved. The phobia wouldn’t, as the psychoanalytic and biomedical theorists claimed, reappear in some other form. Wolpe and his followers, who called themselves behavior therapists, routinely cured fears in a month or two, and the phobias didn’t reappear in any other form.</p>
<p class="indent">For this impertinence—for implying there was nothing particularly complex about psychiatric disorders—Wolpe was made exceedingly uncomfortable in South Africa. He exiled himself, going to Maudsley Hospital in London, then the University of Virginia, and finally Temple University in Philadelphia, where he continued to apply behavior therapy to mental illness. Feisty and opinionated, he regularly got into huge fights with everyone. When followers deviated from his ideas even in small ways, he wrote them off. If this trait was reminiscent of the psychoanalytic orthodoxy by which he himself had been persecuted, the other side of the trait was courage.</p>
<p class="indent">By the late 1960s Philadelphia was becoming the Athens of the new psychology. Joseph Wolpe was fulminating up at Temple, and Tim Beck was now at the University of Pennsylvania, gathering an increasing number of adherents. He quietly drew the same conclusion about depression that Wolpe had drawn about phobia. Depression is nothing more than its symptoms. It is caused by conscious negative thoughts. There is no deep underlying disorder to be rooted out: not unresolved childhood conflicts, not our unconscious anger, and not even our brain chemistry. Emotion comes directly from what we think: Think “I am in danger” and you feel anxiety. Think “I am being trespassed against” and you feel anger. Think “Loss” and you feel sadness.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page75"/>I was an early adherent, believing that the same process—conscious thought gone awry—might be at work in both learned helplessness and depression. I had gone to Cornell University to teach in 1967, right after taking my Ph.D. at the University of Pennsylvania. In 1969 Tim asked me to come back to the University of Pennsylvania and spend a year or two with him to learn his new approach to depression. I returned gladly and found myself in the middle of a group excitedly designing a new kind of therapy for depression.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="c05-nts2a"/>Our reasoning was straightforward. Depression results from lifelong habits of conscious thought. If we change these habits of thought, we will cure depression. Let’s make a direct assault on conscious thought, we said, using everything we know to change the way our patients think about bad events. Out of this came the new approach, which Beck called cognitive therapy. It tries to change the way the depressed patient thinks about failure, defeat, loss, and helplessness. The National Institute of Mental Health has spent millions of dollars testing whether the therapy works on depression. It does.</p>
<p class="extract">H<span class="small">OW YOU THINK</span> about your problems, including depression itself, will either relieve depression or aggravate it. A failure or a defeat can teach you that you are now helpless, but learned helplessness will produce only momentary symptoms of depression—unless you have a pessimistic explanatory style. If you do, then failure and defeat can throw you into a full-blown depression. On the other hand, if your explanatory style is optimistic, your depression will be halted.</p>
<p class="indent">Women are twice as likely to suffer depression as men are, because on the average they think about problems in ways that amplify depression. Men tend to act rather than reflect, but women tend to contemplate their depression, mulling it over and over, trying to analyze it and determine its source. Psychologists call this process of obsessive analysis <em>rumination</em>, a word whose first meaning is “chewing the cud.” Ruminant animals, such as cattle, sheep, and goats, chew a cud composed of regurgitated, partially digested food—not a very appealing image of what people who ruminate do with their thoughts, but an exceedingly apt one. Rumination combined with pessimistic explanatory style is the recipe for severe depression.</p>
<p class="indent">This ends the bad news. The good news is that both pessimistic explanatory style and rumination can be changed, and changed permanently. Cognitive therapy can create optimistic explanatory style and curtail rumination. It prevents new depressions by teaching the skills needed to <a id="page76"/>bounce back from defeat. You will see how it works on others, and then you will learn how to use its techniques on yourself.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c05-s01">Learned Helplessness and Explanatory Style</h2>
<p class="nonindent">W<span class="small">E ALL BECOME</span> momentarily helpless when we fail. The psychological wind is knocked out of us. We feel sad, the future looks dismal, and putting out any effort seems overwhelmingly difficult. Some people recover almost at once; all the symptoms of learned helplessness dissipate within hours. Others stay helpless for weeks or, if the failure is important enough, for months or longer.</p>
<p class="indent">This is the critical difference between brief demoralization and an episode of depression. You will recall that eight of the nine symptoms of depression in the DSM-III-R “Chinese menu” (described in chapter four) are produced by learned helplessness. You must have five of the nine to be diagnosed as suffering a major depressive episode. However, one more factor is needed: The symptoms cannot be momentary; they have to last at least two weeks.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="c05-nts3a"/>The difference between people whose learned helplessness disappears swiftly and people who suffer their symptoms for two weeks or more is usually simple: Members of the latter group have a pessimistic explanatory style, and a pessimistic explanatory style changes learned helplessness from brief and local to long-lasting and general. Learned helplessness becomes full-blown depression when the person who fails is a pessimist. In optimists, a failure produces only brief demoralization.</p>
<p class="indent">The key to this process is hope or hopelessness. Pessimistic explanatory style, you will recall, consists of certain kinds of explanations for bad events: personal (“It’s my fault”), permanent (“It’s always going to be like this”), and pervasive (“It’s going to undermine every aspect of my life”). If you explain a failure permanently and pervasively, you project your present failure into the future and into all new situations. For example, if rejected by someone you love, you may tell yourself, “Women [men] hate me” (a pervasive explanation) and “I’m never going to find anybody” (a permanent explanation). Both of these factors, permanence and pervasiveness, create your expectation that you will be rejected again and again—that it is not just this lover who will reject you but all lovers. Explaining romantic setbacks to yourself this way will undercut all your future quests for love. <a id="page77"/>If, in addition, you believe the cause is personal (“I’m unlovable”), your self-esteem will suffer as well.</p>
<p class="indent">Put all this together and you can see there is one particularly self-defeating way to think: <em>making personal, permanent, and pervasive explanations for bad events</em>. People who have this most pessimistic of all styles are likely, once they fail, to have the symptoms of learned helplessness for a long time and across many endeavors, and to lose self-esteem. Such protracted learned helplessness amounts to depression. This is the central prediction from my theory: People who have a pessimistic explanatory style and suffer bad events will probably become depressed, whereas people who have an optimistic explanatory style and suffer bad events will tend to resist depression.</p>
<p class="indent">If this is so, then pessimism is a risk factor for depression in just the same sense as smoking is a risk factor for lung cancer or being a hostile, hard-driving man is a risk factor for heart attack.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c05-s02">Does Pessimism Cause Depression?</h2>
<p class="nonindent">I <span class="small">HAVE SPENT</span> much of the last ten years testing this prediction. The first thing the University of Pennsylvania group did was the simplest. We gave the explanatory-style questionnaire to depressed people, thousands of them, people with all kinds and degrees of depression. We consistently found that when people are depressed they are also pessimistic. The finding was so consistent and was repeated so often that, according to one estimate, it would take over ten thousand negative studies to cast doubt on it.</p>
<p class="indent">This does not show that pessimism causes depression, only that depressed people happen to be pessimistic at the same time they are depressed. You’d get this same coincidence of pessimism and depression if (to reverse things) it were depression that caused pessimism, or if something else (like brain chemistry) caused both conditions. Finally, part of the way we diagnose depression is to listen to what pessimistic people say. If a patient tells us he is worthless, this pessimistic explanation is part of the reason we diagnose him as depressed. So, the association between pessimistic explanatory style and depression could simply be circular.</p>
<p class="indent">To show that pessimism causes depression, we needed to take a group of people who were not depressed and show that, after some catastrophe, the pessimistic ones became depressed more easily than the optimistic ones. The ideal experiment would have been something like this: to test everyone in a small town on the Gulf Coast of Mississippi for depression and explanatory <a id="page78"/>style and then wait for a hurricane to hit. After the hurricane passed, we’d go see who lay there passively in the mud and who got up and rebuilt the town. There were both ethical and funding problems involved in conducting this “experiment of nature.” So we had to find other ways of testing the causal chain.</p>
<p class="indent">One of my most brilliant undergraduates, Amy Semmel, then a sophomore, solved the dilemma by pointing out natural disasters that hit much closer to home—hit my own classes, in fact, twice a semester. Exams. When my classes began in September, we tested all the students both for depression and for their explanatory style. In October, as the midterm approached, we asked them all what would count as a “failure” for them. On average, they said getting a B+ would constitute failure. (You can see what a bunch of high achievers they were.) This was fine for the experiment since the average grade on my exams is C, which meant most of my students would be subjects. One week later, they took the midterm, and the next week they got their midterm grades back, along with a copy of the Beck Depression Inventory.</p>
<p class="indent">Thirty percent of the people who (by their own definition of failure) failed the midterm got very depressed. And 30 percent of the people who were pessimists in September did, too. But 70 percent of the people who both were pessimists in September <em>and</em> failed the exam got depressed. So a recipe for severe depression is preexisting pessimism encountering failure. In fact, those of this group who made the most permanent and pervasive explanations for why they failed were the people who were still depressed when we tested them again in December.</p>
<p class="indent">A much grimmer setting for an “experiment of nature” took place in prison. We measured the depression level and explanatory style of male prisoners before and after incarceration. Because suicide in prison is such a prevalent problem, we wanted to try to predict who was at most risk for becoming depressed. To our surprise, no one was seriously depressed upon entering prison. To our dismay, almost everyone was depressed on leaving. Some might say this means the prisons are doing their job, but it seems to me something deeply demoralizing is happening during imprisonment. At any rate, we once again correctly predicted who became most depressed of all: those who entered as pessimists. This means pessimism is fertile soil in which depression grows, particularly when the environment is hostile.</p>
<p class="indent">These various findings all pointed to pessimism as a cause of depression. We knew we could take a group of normal people and predict, far in advance, who among them were most likely to succumb to depression when bad events struck.</p>
<p class="indent">Another way of finding out if pessimism causes depression was to look <a id="page79"/>at a group of people across time, in the course of their natural lives. This is called conducting a longitudinal study. We followed a group of 400 third-graders right on through the sixth grade (we’re still following them), measuring their explanatory style, their depression, their school achievement, and their popularity twice a year. We found that the children who started out as pessimists were the ones most likely, over the four years, to get depressed and stay depressed. Those children who started out as optimists stayed nondepressed or, if they did get depressed, they recovered rapidly. When major bad events occurred, like parents separating or getting divorced, the pessimists went under most readily. We also studied young adults and found the same pattern.</p>
<p class="indent">Do these studies really prove that pessimism causes depression, or only that pessimism precedes depression and predicts it? Here’s a particularly devilish argument. Let’s assume people have a great deal of insight into how they react to bad events. Some people have repeatedly seen how devastated they become when bad things happen. This knowledge makes them pessimists. Others, those who will become optimists, have seen how promptly they bounce back. These two groups become pessimists or optimists because they have observed their own reaction to bad events. On this account, pessimism is no more a cause of depression than a speedometer’s reading 60 miles an hour causes the car to speed along: The speedometer and the pessimism merely reflect more basic underlying states.</p>
<p class="indent">I know of only one way to dispatch this argument: Study the way therapy works.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c05-s03">Explanatory Style and Cognitive Therapy</h2>
<p class="nonindent">T<span class="small">ANYA CAME</span> into therapy with a marriage going downhill day by day, three children she saw as wild and uncontrollable, and a very severe depression. She agreed to participate in a study of different therapies for depression and was assigned to receive both cognitive therapy and antidepressant drugs. She allowed the investigators to tape-record her therapy sessions. In these quotes, the italics emphasize the sorts of explanations she gave for her problems. I will attach numbers to each quote. These numbers are her pessimism scores (related to the test in chapter three). They range from 3 (completely temporary, specific, and external) to 21 (completely permanent, pervasive, and personalized). Each individual dimension is coded on a 1 to 7 scale, so the three dimensions added together range <a id="page80"/>from 3 to 31. Numbers in the 3 to 8 range are very optimistic. Numbers above 13 are very pessimistic.<a class="hlink" href="#c05-ftn3" id="c05-ftn3a"><sup class="frac">*</sup></a></p>
<div class="block">
<p class="bl_indent">Tanya felt disgusted with herself <em>“because I always yell at my kids and never apologize”</em> (permanent, rather pervasive, and personal: 17).</p>
<p class="bl_indent">She had no hobbies <em>“because I’m no good at anything”</em> (permanent, pervasive, and personal: 21).</p>
<p class="bl_indent">She failed to take her antidepressant medicine “because I can’t handle it, <em>I’m not strong enough”</em> (permanent, pervasive, and personal: 15).</p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent">Tanya’s explanations were uniformly pessimistic. Whatever it was, if it was bad, it was going to last forever, it was going to destroy everything, and it was her fault.</p>
<p class="indent">Like everyone else in her group, she received twelve weeks of treatment. She did beautifully. Her depression began to lift markedly within a month, and by the end of treatment she was free of depression. Her life wasn’t outwardly much better. Her marriage continued to fall apart by inches. Her children still didn’t behave themselves at school or at home. But she looked at the causes of her problems in a much more optimistic way. Here’s the way she now talked:</p>
<div class="block">
<p class="bl_indent">“I had to go to church alone <em>because my husband was being mean and wouldn’t go”</em> (temporary, specific, and external: 8).</p>
<p class="bl_indent">“I run around looking like rags <em>because the kids have to get their school clothes”</em> (quite temporary, specific, and external: 8).</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>“He took all my money out of the savings account and spent it on himself</em>. If I’d had a gun, I would have shot him” (temporary, specific, and external: 9).</p>
<p class="bl_indent">She had been having trouble driving <em>“because my glasses aren’t dark enough”</em> (temporary, specific, and external: 6).</p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent">When bad events occurred, as they did almost daily, Tanya no longer saw them as unchangeable, pervasive, and her fault. She now began to take action to change things.</p>
<p class="indent">What caused Tanya’s remarkable change from pessimistic to optimistic <a id="page81"/>explanatory style? Was it the drugs or was it the cognitive therapy? Was the change just a sign she had gotten less depressed, or was it the cause of her getting less depressed? Because Tanya was one of many patients assigned to different treatments, these questions could be answered.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="c05-nts4a"/>First, both treatments worked very well. Antidepressant drugs alone and cognitive therapy alone broke up depression reliably. The combination worked even better than either alone, but only slightly better.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, the active ingredient in cognitive therapy was a change in explanatory style from pessimistic to optimistic. The more cognitive therapy done and the more expertly it was delivered, the more thorough the change to optimism. In turn, the greater the change toward optimism, the greater the relief from depression. Drugs, on the other hand, even though they relieved the depression fairly effectively, did not make patients more optimistic. It was reasonable to conclude that although drugs and cognitive therapy both relieve depression, they probably work in quite different ways. Drugs seem to be activators; they push the patient up and out, but they do not make the world look any brighter. Cognitive therapy changes the way you look at things, and this new, optimistic style gets you up and around.</p>
<p class="indent">The third and most important set of findings was about relapse. How permanent was the relief of depression? Tanya’s depression did not recur, although those of many of the other patients in this study did. The results showed that the key to permanent relief of depression was a change in explanatory style. Many of the patients in the drug groups relapsed, but patients who got cognitive therapy did not relapse at nearly that rate. Patients whose explanatory style became optimistic were less likely to relapse than patients whose style remained pessimistic.</p>
<p class="indent">This means cognitive therapy specifically works by making patients more optimistic. It prevents relapse because patients acquire a skill they can use again and again without relying on drugs or doctors. Drugs relieve depression, but only temporarily; unlike cognitive therapy, drugs fail to change the underlying pessimism which is at the root of the problem.</p>
<p class="indent">I concluded from these studies that among people who are not now depressed, pessimistic explanatory style predicts who is going to get depressed. It also predicts who will stay depressed, and it predicts who will relapse after therapy. Changing explanatory style from pessimism to optimism relieves depression markedly.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember our concern that pessimism might merely display the fact that you are easily depressed by bad events, but not itself be a cause of depression. The way to test whether pessimism is a cause is to change pessimism to optimism. If pessimism was only an indicator, like a speedometer, <a id="page82"/>changing to optimism shouldn’t affect how you react to bad events any more than changing the speedometer would change the speed of the car. However, if pessimism is a cause of why you get depressed so easily, changing pessimism into optimism should relieve depression. That is, in fact, what happened. This outcome sews up a causal role for pessimism in depression. It is surely not the <em>only</em> cause of depression—genes, bad events, hormones also put people at risk—but that it is one of the major causes now seems undeniable.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c05-s04">Rumination and Depression</h2>
<p class="nonindent">I<span class="small">F YOU WALK</span> around disposed to believe of any problem that “it’s me, it’s going to last forever, it’s going to undermine everything I try,” you are set up for depression. But just because you may be disposed to think this way doesn’t necessarily mean you frequently utter such thoughts to yourself. Some people do, some don’t. <a id="c05-nts5a"/>People who mull over bad events are called ruminators.</p>
<p class="indent">A ruminator can either be an optimist or a pessimist. Ruminators who are pessimists are in trouble. Their belief structure is pessimistic, and they repeatedly tell themselves how bad things are. Other pessimists are action-oriented and do not ruminate: They have pessimistic explanatory style, but they do not talk to themselves much at all. When they do, it is usually about what they plan to do, not about how bad things are.</p>
<p class="indent">When Tanya came into therapy, she was not only a pessimist, she was a ruminator as well. She brooded about her marriage, her children, and most destructively, her depression itself.</p>
<div class="block">
<p class="bl_indent">“But now, I don’t want to do nothing.…”</p>
<p class="bl_indent">“It’s just really bad for me, I’ve got the blues constantly. I’m not a crying person—I don’t cry unless there’s a real good reason—but, jeez, this time when somebody says something I don’t like, I start crying.…”</p>
<p class="bl_indent">“I can’t take this.…”</p>
<p class="bl_indent">“I’m not a very affectionate person.…”</p>
<p class="bl_indent">“My husband won’t leave me alone. He just bugs me. I wish he wouldn’t be like that.”</p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent">Tanya had succumbed to nonstop rumination, an unbroken string of sour musings with no action statements at all. It wasn’t her pessimism alone that was fueling her depression; it was rumination too.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page83"/>Here’s how the pessimism-rumination chain leads to depression: First, there is some threat against which you believe you are helpless. Second, you look for the threat’s cause, and, if you are a pessimist, the cause you arrive at is permanent, pervasive, and personal. Consequently, you expect to be helpless in the future and in many situations, a conscious expectation that is the last link in the chain, the one triggering depression.</p>
<p class="indent">The expectation of helplessness may arise only rarely, or it may arise all the time. The more you are inclined to ruminate, the more it arises. The more it arises, the more depressed you will be. Brooding, thinking about how bad things are, starts the sequence. Ruminators get this chain going all the time. Any reminder of the original threat causes them to run off the whole pessimism-rumination chain, right through to the expectation of failure and into depression.</p>
<p class="indent">People who do not ruminate tend to avoid depression even if they are pessimists. For them the sequence runs itself off infrequently. Optimists who ruminate also avoid depression. Changing either rumination or pessimism helps relieve depression. Changing both helps the most.</p>
<p class="indent">We find, then, that pessimistic ruminators are most at risk for depression. Cognitive therapy limits rumination as well as creating an optimistic explanatory style. Here’s what Tanya sounded like at the end of therapy:</p>
<div class="block">
<p class="bl_indent">“I don’t want a full-time job again, I just want something part-time, four hours a day so I don’t have to sit in the house all day …” (action).</p>
<p class="bl_indent">“I will feel like I am contributing to the income so if we want to go somewhere, we can go” (action).</p>
<p class="bl_indent">“I kind of like to do spur-of-the-moment things every once in a while” (action).</p>

<h2 class="section" id="c05-s05">The Other Side of the Epidemic: Women vs. Men</h2>
<p class="nonindent">T<span class="small">HE CRUCIAL ROLE</span> rumination plays in depression may be responsible for the arresting fact that <a id="c05-nts6a"/>depression is primarily female. Study after study has found that during the twentieth century, depression has struck women more frequently than men. The ratio is now two to one.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page84"/>Why should women suffer so much more?</p>
<p class="indent">Is it because women are more willing to go to therapy than men and thus show up more frequently in the statistics? No. The same preponderance of women shows up in door-to-door surveys.</p>
<p class="indent">Is it because women are more willing to talk openly about their troubles? Probably not. The two-to-one ratio shows up in both public and anonymous conditions.</p>
<p class="indent">Is it because women tend to have worse jobs and less money than men do? No. The ratio stays two-to-one even when groups of women and men are matched for the same jobs and the same income: Rich women have twice as much depression as rich men, and unemployed women twice as much as unemployed men.</p>
<p class="indent">Is it some sort of biological difference that produces more depression? Probably not. Studies of premenstrual and postpartum emotionality show that while hormone fluctuations do tend to affect depression, the effect isn’t nearly big enough to make a two-to-one difference.</p>
<p class="indent">Is it a genetic difference? Careful studies of how much depression occurs among the sons and daughters of male and female depressives show there is substantial depression among the sons of male depressives—too much, considering the way chromosomes are passed from father to son and from mother to daughter, for it to be true that genetics underpins the lopsided sex ratio. There is evidence of a genetic contribution to depression, but there is no evidence that genes contribute more to depression in women than in men.</p>
<p class="indent">Three interesting theories remain.</p>
<p class="indent">The first concerns sex roles—that there is something about a woman’s role in our society that makes her fertile ground for depression.</p>
<p class="indent">One fashionable argument in this category is that women are brought up to invest in love and in social relations, while men are brought up to invest in achievement. A woman’s self-esteem, runs the argument, depends on how love and friendship go; social failure, therefore—from divorce and separation, to children leaving the nest, to a wasted evening with an awful blind date—hits women harder than men. This may be true, but it does not explain why women are twice as likely to be depressed. For the argument can be turned around: By this hypothesis, men take failure at work more seriously. Bad grades, no promotion, the softball team losing—these too deplete a man’s self-esteem. And failure seems just as common in work as in love, so the net effect would be just as much depression in men as in women.</p>
<p class="indent">Another fashionable sex-role argument dwells on role conflict: There are more conflicting demands on women than on men in modern life. A <a id="page85"/>woman not only has the traditional role of mother and wife but now must hold down a job as well. This extra demand produces more pressure than ever before and therefore more depression. The argument sounds plausible; but, like many plausible and ideologically congenial theories, it dashes against the rocks of fact. Working wives are less depressed, on average, than wives who do not work outside the home. So sex-role explanations do not seem to account for the two-to-one female preponderance of depression.</p>
<p class="indent">The second of the remaining theories involves learned helplessness and explanatory style. In our society, it is argued, women receive abundant experience with helplessness over the course of their lives. Boys’ behavior is lauded or criticized by their parents and their teachers, while girls’ is often ignored. Boys are trained for self-reliance and activity, girls for passivity and dependence. When they grow up, women find themselves in a culture that depreciates the role of wife and mother. If a woman turns to the world of work, she finds her achievements are given less credit than men’s. When she speaks in a meeting, she gets more bored nods than a man would. If despite all this she manages to excel and is promoted to a position of power, she is seen as being out of place. Learned helplessness at every turn. If women tend to have a more pessimistic explanatory style than men do, any given helplessness experience will tend to produce more depression in a woman than in a man. And indeed there are data showing that any given stressful factor causes more depression in women than in men.</p>
<p class="indent">This theory is also plausible, but not without its holes. One hole is that no one has ever proven that women are more pessimistic than men. Indeed the only relevant study of randomly sampled males and females is among grade-school children, and it comes out the opposite way. Among third-, fourth-, and fifth-graders, boys are more pessimistic than girls and more depressed. When parents divorce, the boys get more depressed than the girls do. (All this may change at puberty, and indeed it does seem the two-to-one depression ratio begins in the teenage years. Something may happen at puberty that flips young women into depression and young men out of it. More of this later, when we talk about parenting and about school in chapters seven and eight.) Another problem is that no one has ever shown that women see their lives as more uncontrollable than men do.</p>
<p class="indent">The last of the three theories involves rumination. In this view, when trouble strikes, women think and men act. When a woman gets fired from her job, she tries to figure out why; she broods, and she relives the events over and over. A man, upon getting fired, acts: He gets drunk, beats someone up, or otherwise distracts himself from thinking about it. He may <a id="page86"/>even go right out and look for another job, without bothering to think through what went wrong. If depression is a disorder of thinking, pessimism and rumination stoke it. The tendency to analyze feeds right into it; the tendency to act breaks it up.</p>
<p class="indent">In fact, depression itself may set off rumination more in women than men. When we find ourselves depressed, what do we do? Women try to figure out where the depression came from. Men go out to play basketball, or leave for the office to work to distract themselves. Men are more often alcoholic than women are; perhaps the difference is great enough to enable us to say: Men drink, women get depressed. It might be that men drink to forget their troubles while women ruminate. The woman, ruminating away about the source of the depression, will only get more depressed, whereas the man, responding by taking action, may cut depression off.</p>
<p class="indent">The rumination theory just might be able to explain the depression epidemic in general as well as the lopsided sex ratio. If we now live in an age of self-consciousness, in which we are encouraged to take our problems more earnestly and analyze them endlessly rather than act, more depression might well be the result. I’ll talk more about this speculation in chapter fifteen.</p>
<p class="indent">Evidence has poured in recently that supports the role of rumination in producing the sex differences in depression. Susan Nolen-Hoeksema of Stanford University, who originated the rumination theory, has led the way in testing it. When women rate what they actually do (not what they <em>should</em> do) when they are depressed, the majority say, “I tried to analyze my mood” or “I tried to find out why I felt the way I did.” The majority of men, on the other hand, say they did something they enjoyed, like sports or playing a musical instrument, or they say, “I decided not to concern myself with my mood.”</p>
<p class="indent">The same pattern held in a diary study in which men and women wrote down everything they did as bad moods struck: Women thought and analyzed their mood; men distracted themselves. In a study of couples in conflict, each person dictated into a tape recorder what he or she did every time there was marital trouble. In overwhelming proportions the women focused on and expressed their emotion, and the men distracted themselves or decided not to be concerned with their mood. Finally, in a laboratory study, men and women were offered a choice of two tasks when they were sad. They could choose to list the words that best described their mood (a task focusing on the depression) or rank a list of nations in order of their wealth (a distracting task). Seventy percent of the women chose the emotion-focused task, listing the words that described their mood. With men, however, the percentages were reversed.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page87"/>So analyzing and wallowing in emotion when distressed seems a likely explanation for why women are more depressed than men. This implies that men and women experience mild depression at the same rate, but in women, who dwell on the state, the mild depression escalates; men, on the other hand, dissolve the state by distracting themselves, by action or perhaps by drinking it away.</p>
<p class="indent">We are left with two plausible views that have some support. One is that women learn more helplessness and pessimism, and the second is that women’s likelier first reaction to trouble—rumination—leads right into depression.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c05-s06">Depression as Curable</h2>
<p class="nonindent">O<span class="small">NE HUNDRED</span> years ago, the most fashionable explanation for human action, particularly bad human action, was character. Words like <em>mean, stupid, criminal, evil</em>—these were considered satisfactory explanations for bad behavior. <em>Crazy</em> was accepted as an explanation for mental illness. These terms denote traits that can’t be changed easily, if at all. As prophecy, they are also self-fulfilling. People who believe themselves stupid, rather than uneducated, don’t take action to improve their minds. A society that views its criminals as evil and the mentally ill as crazy does not support institutions truly designed for rehabilitation but supports, instead, institutions meant for vengeance or for warehousing human beings to keep them out of sight.</p>
<p class="indent">Toward the end of the nineteenth century, the labels and the concepts behind them began to change. The growing political clout of the massive labor force probably began the transformation. Then came wave after wave of European and Asian immigrants who visibly bettered themselves in less than a generation. Explanations of human failure in terms of abiding bad character gave way to suggestions of bad upbringing or bad environment. Ignorance began to be seen as lack of education, not stupidity, and crime as issuing from poverty, not evil. Poverty itself was now thought of as lack of opportunity, not sloth. Madness began to be seen as consisting of maladaptive habits that could be unlearned. This new ideology, which stressed one’s environment, was the backbone of the behaviorism that dominated American (and Russian) psychology from 1920 to 1965, from Lenin to LBJ.</p>
<p class="indent">Behaviorism’s successor, cognitive psychology, retained the optimistic belief in change and wed it to an expanded view of the self, developing <a id="page88"/>the thesis that the self could improve itself. People who wanted to reduce the amount of human failure in this world could look beyond the difficulties of changing the conditions of upbringing and environment; they could embrace the prospect that the individual could choose to act on himself. For example, curing mental illness no longer rested solely in the hands of therapists, social workers, and asylums. It now passed in part into the hands of the sufferers.</p>
<p class="indent">This belief is the intellectual underpinning of the self-improvement movement, the wellspring of all those diet books, exercise books, and books on changing your personality: your Type A risk for heart attack, your airplane phobia, your depression. What is remarkable is that much of this self-improving ideology is not claptrap. A society that exalts the self to the extent ours does produces an entity that is not a chimera. The self-improving self actually improves itself. You can indeed lose weight, lower your cholesterol level, be physically stronger and more attractive, less compulsively time-urgent and reflexively hostile, less pessimistic.</p>
<p class="indent">The belief in self-improvement is a prophecy just as self-fulfilling as the old belief that character could not be changed. People who believe they don’t have to be sedentary or hostile will try to take the steps that get them jogging or make them think twice when trespassed against; people who don’t believe change is possible will indeed remain incapable of change. A culture believing in self-improvement will support health clubs, Alcoholics Anonymous, and psychotherapy. A culture believing that bad action stems from bad character and is permanent won’t even try.</p>
<p class="indent">Scientists who speak of a self that can act to change the self are not spouting metaphysical boosterism. The computer provides the physical model for such claims. A computer, even a PC, can compare its output to that of a template (an ideal situation), find the places where the fit is imperfect, and move to correct the imperfections. Having done this, it can once again compare what it has done to what it should do and, if still wrong, act to correct itself again. When the match is perfect, it will stop. If a home computer can bring this off, self-improvement should be a breeze for the vastly more complex human brain.</p>
<p class="indent">Human beings have been getting severely depressed ever since failure began—perhaps not in the droves they do today, but depressed nevertheless. And when the medieval swain failed to conquer a fair maiden’s heart, his mother told him not to obsess about it, probably without any more effect than mothers today have on the depressions their children bring home. Then, in the 1980s, along came cognitive therapy, which tries to change the way people think about their failures. Its maxims aren’t terribly different from the wisdom the grandmothers and preachers of yore had <a id="page89"/>tried, without notable success, to impart. But cognitive therapy works.</p>
<p class="indent">What does cognitive therapy do, and why does it work?</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c05-s07">Cognitive Therapy and Depression</h2>
<p class="nonindent">T<span class="small">O AN AUDIENCE</span> that swelled over the 1970s, Aaron Beck and Albert Ellis both argued that what we consciously think is what mainly determines how we feel. From this thesis a therapy developed that sought to change the way the depressed patient consciously thinks about failure, defeat, loss, and helplessness. <a id="c05-nts7a"/>Cognitive therapy uses five tactics.</p>
<p class="indent">First, you learn to recognize the automatic thoughts flitting through your consciousness at the times you feel worst. Automatic thoughts are very quick phrases or sentences, so well practiced as to be almost unnoticed and unchallenged. For example, a mother of three children sometimes screams at them as she sends them off to school. She feels very depressed as a consequence. In cognitive therapy she learns to recognize that right after these screaming incidents she always says to herself, “I’m a terrible mother—even worse than my own mother.” She learns to become aware of these automatic thoughts, and learns that they are her explanations, and that those explanations are permanent, pervasive, and personal.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, you learn to dispute the automatic thoughts by marshaling contrary evidence. The mother is helped to remember and acknowledge that when the kids come home from school, she plays football with them, tutors them in geometry, and talks to them sympathetically about their problems. She focuses on this evidence and sees that it contradicts her automatic thought that she is a bad mother.</p>
<p class="indent">Third, you learn to make different explanations, called reattributions, and use them to dispute your automatic thoughts. The mother might learn to say something like: “I’m fine with the kids in the <span class="small">P.M</span>. and terrible in the <span class="small">A.M</span>. Maybe I’m not a morning person.” That’s a much less permanent and pervasive explanation for screaming at the kids in the morning. As for the chain of negative explanations that goes, “I’m a terrible mother, I’m not fit to have kids, therefore I don’t deserve to live,” she learns to interrupt it by inserting the contrary, new explanation.</p>
<p class="indent">Fourth, you learn how to distract yourself from depressing thoughts. The mother learns that thinking these negative things now is not inevitable. Rumination, particularly when one is under pressure to perform well, makes the situation even worse. Often it is better to put off thinking, in <a id="page90"/>order to do your best. You can learn to control not only what you think but when you think it.</p>
<p class="indent">Fifth, you learn to recognize and question the depression-sowing assumptions governing so much of what you do:</p>
<div class="block">
<p class="bl_nonindent">“I can’t live without love.”</p>
<p class="bl_nonindent">“Unless everything I do is perfect, I’m a failure.”</p>
<p class="bl_nonindent">“Unless everybody likes me, I’m a failure.”</p>
<p class="bl_nonindent">“There is a perfect right solution for every problem. I must find it.”</p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent">Premises like these set you up for depression. If you choose to live by them—as so many of us do—your life will be filled with black days and blue weeks. But just as a person can change his explanatory style from pessimistic to optimistic, he can also choose a new set of more human premises to live by:</p>
<div class="block">
<p class="bl_nonindent">“Love is precious but rare.”</p>
<p class="bl_nonindent">“Success is doing my best.”</p>
<p class="bl_nonindent">“For every person who likes you, one person doesn’t like you.”</p>
<p class="bl_nonindent">“Life consists of putting my fingers in the biggest leaks in the dam.”</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The depression suffered by Sophie—the former “golden girl” who had come to consider herself unlovable, untalented, “a washout”—is typical of the depressions young people are experiencing in unprecedented numbers. Her depression had at its core a pessimistic explanatory style. After she began cognitive therapy, life quickly turned around for her. Her treatment took a total of three months, one hour per week. Her outside world did not change, at least not at first, but the way she thought about it changed mightily.</p>
<p class="indent">First, she was helped to see that she had been conducting an unrelievedly negative dialogue with herself. She remembered that when she’d made a comment in class and had been complimented by the professor, she had immediately thought: “She’s just trying to be nice to all the students.” When she’d read about Indira Gandhi’s assassination, she’d thought: “All women leaders are doomed, one way or another.” When her friend had been impotent late one night, she’d thought: “I’m repulsive to him.”</p>
<p class="indent">I asked her, “If a drunk reeling on the street told you you were repulsive, would you discount it?”</p>
<p class="indent">“Sure.”</p>
<p class="indent">“But when you say equally groundless things to yourself, you believe <a id="page91"/>them. This is because you think the source, yourself, is more credible. It isn’t. Often we distort reality more than drunks do.”</p>
<p class="indent">Sophie soon learned to marshal evidence against her automatic thoughts and thus challenge them: She remembered that the professor who had complimented her did not in fact flatter everyone but had been quite cutting when another student commented in class. She focused on the fact that the lover who’d been impotent had drunk an entire six-pack in the hour before they made love. She learned a crucial skill: how to conduct an optimistic personal dialogue. She learned how to talk to herself when she failed and how not to talk to herself when things went well. She learned that when she expected to fail, failure became more likely. Her explanatory style changed permanently from pessimistic to optimistic.</p>
<p class="indent">Sophie caught fire again academically, and she graduated with high honors. She began a love affair which is now a fulfilling marriage.</p>
<p class="indent">Unlike most people who are prone to depression, Sophie learned how to prevent its return. The difference between Sophie and someone who takes antidepressant drugs is that she learned a set of skills to use whenever she is faced with failure or defeat—skills she always carries with her. Her victory over depression is hers alone, not something she must credit to doctors and the latest medication.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c05-s08">Why Does Cognitive Therapy Work?</h2>
<p class="nonindent">T<span class="small">HERE ARE</span> two kinds of answers to this question. On a mechanical level, cognitive therapy works because it changes explanatory style from pessimistic to optimistic, and the change is permanent. It gives you a set of cognitive skills for talking to yourself when you fail. You can use these skills to stop depression from taking hold when failure strikes.</p>
<p class="indent">At a philosophical level, cognitive therapy works because it takes advantage of newly legitimized powers of the self. In an era when we believe the self can change itself, we are willing to try to change habits of thought which used to seem as inevitable as sunrise. Cognitive therapy works in our era because it gives the self a set of techniques for changing itself. The self chooses to do this work out of self-interest, to make itself feel better.</p>
