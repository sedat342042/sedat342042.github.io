<h1 class="chapter" id="c03"><a id="page31"/>3<br/><em>Explaining Misfortune</em></h1>
<p class="nonindent">O<span class="small">XFORD</span> U<span class="small">NIVERSITY</span> is an intimidating place to give a lecture. It’s not so much the spires and gargoyles, or even the knowledge that for over seven hundred years this place has led the intellectual world. It’s Oxford’s dons. They had turned out in force that day in April 1975 to hear the upstart American psychologist who was on sabbatical at Maudsley Hospital’s Institute of Psychiatry in London and who had traveled to Oxford to talk about his research. As I arranged my speech on the rostrum and looked nervously out into the hall, I could see the ethologist Niko Tinbergen, a 1973 Nobel laureate. I could see Jerome Bruner, a celebrated academic who had recently come to Oxford from Harvard to take the Regius professorship in child development. There too was Donald Broadbent, the founder of modern cognitive psychology and the foremost “applied” social scientist in the world, and Michael Gelder, the dean of British psychiatry. And there was Jeffrey Gray, the renowned expert on anxiety and the brain. These were the greats of my profession. I felt like an actor who has been pushed out onto a stage to do a soliloquy before Guinness, Gielgud, and Olivier.</p>
<p class="indent">I launched into my speech about learned helplessness, and I was relieved to find the dons reasonably responsive, some of them nodding at my conclusions, most of them chuckling at my jokes. But in the middle of the front row was an intimidating stranger. He was not laughing at my jokes, and at several crucial points he conspicuously shook his head no. He seemed to be keeping a running total of mistakes I had unknowingly made.</p>
<p class="indent">At last the speech was finished. The applause was appreciative, and I was relieved, for the occasion was now over except for the polite platitudes <a id="page32"/>traditionally offered by the professor assigned to be the “discussant.” The discussant, however, turned out to be the naysayer from the front row. His name was given as John Teasdale. I had heard the name before but knew almost nothing about him. Teasdale, it proved, was a new lecturer in the psychiatry department, fresh up from the psychology department at Maudsley Hospital in London.</p>
<p class="indent">“You really shouldn’t be carried away by this enchanting story,” he told the audience. “The theory is wholly inadequate. Seligman has glossed over the fact that one-third of his human subjects never become helpless. Why not? And of the ones who did, some bounced back right away; others never recovered. Some were helpless only in the very situation they learned to be helpless about; they no longer tried to escape from noise. Yet others gave up in brand-new situations. Let us ask ourselves why. Some lost self-esteem and blamed themselves for failing to escape the noise, while others blamed the experimenter for giving them unsolvable problems. Why?”</p>
<p class="indent">Baffled looks appeared on many of the dons’ faces. Teasdale’s piercing critique had thrown everything into doubt. Ten years of research, which had looked definitive to me when I began the talk, now seemed full of loose ends.</p>
<p class="indent">I was almost dumbstruck. I thought Teasdale was right, and I was embarrassed I hadn’t thought of these objections myself. I mumbled something about this being the way science progresses and by way of rejoinder asked if Teasdale himself could solve the paradox he had set before me.</p>
<p class="indent">“Yes, I think I can,” he said. “But this is neither the time nor the place.”</p>
<p class="indent">I won’t yet reveal Teasdale’s solution, for I am going to ask you first to take a short test, one that will help you discover whether you are an optimist or a pessimist. Knowing Teasdale’s answer to the question of why some people never become helpless might distort the way you take that test.</p>
<h3 class="section"><em>Test Your Own Optimism</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">Take as much time as you need to answer each of the questions. On average the test takes about fifteen minutes. There are no right or wrong answers. It is important that you take the test <em>before</em> you read the analysis which follows it, in order to assure that your answers will not be biased.</p>
<p class="indent">Read the description of each situation and vividly imagine it happening to you. You have probably not experienced some of the situations, but that doesn’t matter. Perhaps neither response will seem to fit; go ahead anyway and circle either A or B, choosing the cause likelier to apply to <a id="page33"/>you. You may not like the way some of the responses sound, but don’t choose what you think you <em>should</em> say or what would sound right to other people; choose the response you’d be likelier to have.</p>
<p class="indent">Circle only one response for each question. Ignore the letter and number codes for now.</p>

<h2 class="section" id="c03-s01"><a id="page40"/>Explanatory Style</h2>
<p class="nonindent">W<span class="small">HEN</span> J<span class="small">OHN</span> T<span class="small">EASDALE</span> raised his objections after my speech at Oxford, I felt for a moment as if years of work might have been for nothing. I had no way of knowing at the time that the Teasdale challenge would result in the thing I wanted most of all—using our findings to help needful and suffering human beings.</p>
<p class="indent">Yes, Teasdale had granted in his rebuttal, two out of three people became helpless. But, he’d stressed, one out of three resisted: No matter what happened to them to make them helpless, they would not give up. It was a paradox, and until it was resolved, my theory could not be taken seriously.</p>
<p class="indent">Leaving the hall with Teasdale after the address, I asked him if he’d be willing to work with me to see if we could construct an adequate theory. He agreed, and we began meeting regularly. I’d come down from London and we’d take long walks through the manicured Oxford grounds and the tree-lined meadows called The Backs, talking out his objections. I asked for his solution to the problem he had posed, about who is vulnerable to helplessness and who is not. I learned that for Teasdale the solution came down to this: how people explain to themselves the bad things that happen to them. People who made certain kinds of explanations, he believed, are prey to helplessness. Teaching them to change these explanations might prove an effective way to treat their depression.</p>
<p class="indent">Every two months or so during this period in England, I made week-long trips back to the United States. On my first trip I returned to the University of Pennsylvania to find that my theory was being assaulted by challenges almost identical to Teasdale’s. The challengers were two fearless students in my own research group, Lyn Abramson and Judy Garber.</p>
<p class="indent">Lyn and Judy had both been caught up in a vogue—enthusiasm for the work of a man named Bernard Weiner. In the late 1960s Weiner, a young social psychologist at the University of California’s Los Angeles campus, had started to wonder why some people are high achievers and other people are not. He concluded that the way people think about the causes of successes and failures was what really mattered. His approach was called attribution theory. (That is, it asked to what factors people attributed their successes and failures.)</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="c03-nts1a"/>This view ran against the existing belief about achievement, the classic demonstration of which was called PREE—the partial reinforcement extinction effect. PREE is an old chestnut of learning theory. If you give a rat a food pellet every time he presses a bar, this is called “continuous <a id="page41"/>reinforcement”; the ratio of reward to effort is one-to-one, one pellet for one bar-press. If you then stop giving him food for pressing the bar (“extinction”), he’ll press the bar three or four times and then quit completely, because he can see he’s never getting fed anymore, since the contrast is so great. If, on the other hand, instead of one-for-one reinforcement, you give the rat “partial” reinforcement—say, an average of only one pellet for every five or ten times he presses—and then start extinction, he’ll press the bar a hundred times before he gives up.</p>
<p class="indent">PREE had been demonstrated in the 1930s. It was the kind of experiment that made the reputation of B. F. Skinner and established him as the panjandrum of the behaviorists. The PREE principle, however, though it worked with rats and pigeons, didn’t work very well with people. Some would give up as soon as extinction began; others would keep going.</p>
<p class="indent">Weiner had an idea why it didn’t work with people: Those people who thought the cause of extinction was permanent (who concluded, for example, “The experimenter has decided not to reward me anymore”) would give up right away, while those who thought the cause was temporary (“There’s a short circuit in this damned equipment”) would keep on going, because they thought the situation might change and the reward would resume. When Weiner performed this experiment, he found just the results he predicted. It was the explanations people made, and not the schedule of reinforcement they’d been on, which determined their susceptibility to PREE. Attribution theory went on to postulate that human behavior is controlled not just by the “schedule of reinforcement” in the environment but by an internal mental state, the explanations people make for why the environment has scheduled their reinforcements in this way.</p>
<p class="indent">This work had great impact in the field, especially upon younger scholars like Lyn Abramson and Judy Garber. It had shaped their whole outlook, and it was the lens through which they examined the theory of learned helplessness. When, during my first trip home from England, I told my colleagues what John Teasdale had said, Lyn and Judy replied that he was right and I was wrong, and the theory would have to be reformulated.</p>
<p class="indent">Lyn Abramson had shown up at Penn only the year before, as a first-year graduate student. She was immediately recognized as one of the best young psychology scholars anyone had seen in years. Outward signs to the contrary notwithstanding—her unworldly appearance, her patched jeans, her torn cotton shirts—she had a first-class mind. She first set out to discover which drugs produced learned helplessness in animals and which made helplessness less likely. She was trying to show that depression and helplessness were the same by showing they had the same brain-chemical mechanisms.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page42"/>Judy Garber had dropped out of a clinical psychology program at a southern university during a time of personal crisis. Putting her life back together, she had volunteered to work in my lab unpaid for several years. She’d told me she wanted to show the world she could make a real contribution to psychology there, so she could eventually apply to a first-rate graduate program. The people in the lab always did a double take when they saw this fashionably dressed young woman with long, painted fingernails feeding white rats their daily chow. But Judy’s ability, like Lyn’s, soon became manifest, and before long she was involved in more advanced matters. That spring of 1975 Judy too was working on helplessness in animals. When the challenge from Teasdale came along, both Lyn and Judy dropped their own projects and began to work with us on reformulating the theory so it would apply better to people.</p>
<p class="indent">Throughout my career, I’ve never had much use for the tendency among psychologists to shun criticism. It’s a longstanding tradition acquired from the field of psychiatry, with its medical authoritarianism and its reluctance to admit error. Going back at least to Freud, the world of the research psychiatrists has been dominated by a handful of despots who treat dissenters like invading barbarians usurping their domain. One critical word from a young disciple and he was banished.</p>
<p class="indent">I’ve preferred the humanistic tradition. To the scientists of the Renaissance, your critic was really your ally, helping you advance upon reality. Critics in science are not like drama critics, determining flops and successes. Criticism to scientists is just another means of finding out whether they’re wrong, like running another experiment to see if it confirms or refutes a theory. Along with the advocacy principle of the courtroom, It is one of the best ways human beings have evolved to get closer to the truth.</p>
<p class="indent">I had always stressed to my students the importance of welcoming criticism. “I want to be told,” I had always said. “In this lab, the payoff is for originality, not toadyism.” Now Abramson and Garber, not to mention Teasdale, had told me, and I was not about to bristle with hostility. I promptly enlisted the three of them as allies in making the theory better. I argued with my two brilliant students, sometimes for twelve hours without a break, working to make my theory incorporate their objections.</p>
<p class="indent">I launched into two sets of conversations. The first, in Oxford, was with Teasdale. John’s commitment was to therapy, and so, as we discussed how to change the theory, we explored the possibility of treating depression by changing the ways depressive people explained to themselves the causes of bad events. The second, with Abramson and Garber back in Philadelphia, took its character from Lyn’s strong interest in the etiology—the causes—of mental illness.</p>
<p class="indent">Teasdale and I started writing a manuscript together, on how therapy <a id="page43"/>for helplessness and depression should be based on changing people’s explanations. Concurrently, Abramson and I started one on how people’s explanatory style could cause helplessness and depression.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="c03-nts2a"/>At that moment, as it happened, the editor-in-chief of the <em>Journal of Abnormal Psychology</em> contacted me. The learned-helplessness controversy, he said, had generated a great many submissions to the journal, many of them attacks of just the sort John and Lyn and Judy had made. The editor was planning to devote a whole issue of the journal to the battle, and he asked if I would write one of the articles. I agreed and then persuaded Lyn and John to let me merge the two articles we had been working on separately. I felt it important that when the new theory got this very prominent airing, it would already contain our responses to the attacks.</p>
<p class="indent">Our approach drew on Bernard Weiner’s attribution theory, but it differed from Weiner in three ways. First, we were interested in <em>habits</em> of explanation, not just the single explanation a person makes for a single failure. We claimed there was such a thing as a <em>style</em> of explanation: We all had a style of seeing causes, and if given a chance we’d impose this habit on our world. Second, where Weiner had talked about two dimensions of explanation—permanence and personalization—we introduced another—pervasiveness—to make three. (I’ll soon explain these concepts.) Third, while Weiner was interested in achievement, we were focused on mental illness and therapy.</p>
<p class="indent">The special issue of the <em>Journal of Abnormal Psychology</em> was published in February 1978. It contained the article by Lyn, John, and me, answering in advance the main objections to the original learned-helplessness theory. It was well received and itself generated even more research than the original helplessness theory had. We went on to devise the questionnaire you took earlier in this chapter. With the creation of the questionnaire, explanatory style could be easily measured and our approach applied, out in the real world beyond the lab, to actual human problems.</p>
<p class="indent">Each year the American Psychological Association gives the Early Career Award to a psychologist who attains “distinguished scientific achievement” within the first ten years of his career. I had won it in 1976 for the theory of helplessness. Lyn Abramson won it in 1982 for the reformulation of the theory of helplessness.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c03-s02">Who Never Gives Up?</h2>
<p class="nonindent">H<span class="small">OW DO</span> <em>you</em> think about the causes of the misfortunes, small and large, that befall you? Some people, the ones who give up easily, habitually say <a id="page44"/>of their misfortunes: “It’s me, it’s going to last forever, it’s going to undermine everything I do.” Others, those who resist giving in to misfortune, say: “It was just circumstances, it’s going away quickly anyway, and, besides, there’s much more in life.”</p>
<p class="indent">Your habitual way of explaining bad events, your explanatory style, is more than just the words you mouth when you fail. It is a habit of thought, learned in childhood and adolescence. Your explanatory style stems directly from your view of your place in the world—whether you think you are valuable and deserving, or worthless and hopeless. It is the hallmark of whether you are an optimist or a pessimist.</p>
<p class="indent">The test you took earlier in this chapter is designed to reveal your explanatory style.</p>
<p class="extract">T<span class="small">HERE ARE</span> three crucial dimensions to your explanatory style: permanence, pervasiveness, and personalization.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c03-s02-s01"><em>Permanence:</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">P<span class="small">EOPLE WHO</span> give up easily believe the causes of the bad events that happen to them are permanent: The bad events will persist, will always be there to affect their lives. People who resist helplessness believe the causes of bad events are temporary.</p>

<p class="indent">If you think about bad things in <em>always’s</em> and <em>never’s</em> and abiding traits, you have a permanent, pessimistic style. If you think in <em>sometimes’s</em> and <em>lately’s</em>, if you use qualifiers and blame bad events on transient conditions, you have an optimistic style.</p>
<p class="indent">Now turn back to your test. Look at the eight items marked “PmB” (which stands for Permanent <em>Bad)</em>, the questions numbered 5, 13, 20, 21, 29, 33, 42, and 46.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page45"/>These tested how permanent you tend to think the causes of bad events are. Each one with a <em>0</em> after it is optimistic. Each one followed by a 1 is pessimistic. So, for example, if you chose “I’m not good at remembering birthdays” (question 5) rather than “I was preoccupied with other things” to explain why you forgot your spouse’s birthday, you chose a more permanent, and therefore pessimistic, cause.</p>
<p class="indent">Total the numbers at the right-hand margin of the PmB questions. Write your total on the PmB line in the scoring key on <a class="hlink" href="#page39">this page</a>.</p>
<div class="block">
<p class="bl_hanging">If you totaled 0 or 1, you are very optimistic on this dimension;</p>
<p class="bl_hanging">2 or 3 is a moderately optimistic score;</p>
<p class="bl_hanging">4 is average;</p>
<p class="bl_hanging">5 or 6 is quite pessimistic; and</p>
<p class="bl_hanging">if you scored 7 or 8, you will find Part Three of this book, “Changing: From Pessimism to Optimism,” very helpful.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Here’s why the permanence dimension matters so much—and here is our answer to John Teasdale’s challenge about why some people stay helpless forever while others bounce back right away.</p>
<p class="indent">Failure makes everyone at least <em>momentarily</em> helpless. It’s like a punch in the stomach. It hurts, but the hurt goes away—for some people almost instantly. These are the people whose score totals 0 or 1. For others, the hurt lasts; it seethes, it roils, it congeals into a grudge. These people score 7 or 8. They remain helpless for days or perhaps months, even after only small setbacks. After major defeats they may never come back.</p>
<p class="extract"><em>T<span class="small">HE</span> optimistic style</em> of explaining good events is just the opposite of the optimistic style of explaining bad events. People who believe good events have permanent causes are more optimistic than people who believe they have temporary causes.</p>

<p class="indent">Optimistic people explain good events to themselves in terms of permanent causes: traits, abilities, <em>always’s</em>. Pessimists name transient causes: moods, effort, <em>sometimes’s</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">You probably noticed that some of the questions on the test (exactly half of them, in fact) were about good events; for example, “Your stocks <a id="page46"/>make you a lot of money.” Score those marked “PmG” (Permanent Good): 2, 10, 14, 15, 24, 26, 38, and 40.</p>

<p class="indent">People who believe good events have permanent causes try even harder after they succeed. People who see temporary reasons for good events may give up even when they succeed, believing success was a fluke.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c03-s02-s02"><em>Pervasiveness: Specific vs. Universal</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">P<span class="small">ERMANENCE</span> is about time. Pervasiveness is about space.</p>
<p class="indent">Consider this example: In a large retailing firm, half the accounting department was fired. Two of the fired accountants, Nora and Kevin, both became depressed. Neither could bear to look for another job for several months, and both avoided doing their income tax or anything else that reminded them of accounting. Nora, however, remained a loving and active wife. Her social life went on normally, her health stayed robust, and she continued to work out three times a week. Kevin, in contrast, fell apart. He ignored his wife and baby son, spending all his evenings in sullen brooding. He refused to go to parties, saying he couldn’t bear to see people. He never laughed at jokes. He caught a cold that lasted all winter, and he gave up jogging.</p>
<p class="indent">Some people can put their troubles neatly into a box and go about their lives even when one important aspect of it—their job, for example, or their love life—is suffering. Others bleed all over everything. They catastrophize. When one thread of their lives snaps, the whole fabric unravels.</p>
<p class="indent">It comes down to this: People who make <em>universal</em> explanations for their failures give up on everything when a failure strikes in one area. People who make <em>specific</em> explanations may become helpless in that one part of their lives yet march stalwartly on in the others.</p>
<p class="indent">Here are some universal and some specific explanations of bad events:</p>

<p class="indent">Nora and Kevin had the same high score on the permanence dimension of the test. They were both pessimists in this respect. When they were fired, they both remained depressed for a long time. But they had opposite scores on the pervasiveness dimension. Kevin believed the firing would undermine everything he tried; he thought he was no good at anything. Nora believed bad events have very specific causes. When she was fired, she thought she was no good at accounting.</p>
<p class="indent">On those long Oxford walks with John Teasdale, we took the paradox he cited—about who gives up and who doesn’t—broke it into three parts, and made three predictions about who gives up and who doesn’t:</p>
<p class="indent">The first was that the <em>permanence</em> dimension determines how long a person gives up for. Permanent explanations for bad events produce long-lasting helplessness and temporary explanations produce resilience.</p>
<p class="indent">The second prediction was about <em>pervasiveness</em>. Universal explanations produce helplessness across many situations and specific explanations produce helplessness only in the troubled area. Kevin was a victim of the pervasiveness dimension. Once fired he believed the cause was universal, and he behaved as though disaster had struck all aspects of his life. Kevin’s pervasiveness score revealed he was a catastrophizer. The third prediction concerned <em>personalization</em> and you will read about it shortly.</p>
<p class="indent">Do you catastrophize? Did you catastrophize in this test? For example, in answering question 18, did you label the cause of losing as your not being very athletic (universal) or your not being good at that sport (specific)? Take each question marked “PvB” (Pervasiveness Bad): 8, 16, 17, 18, 22, 32, 44, and 48.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the numbers at the right-hand margin and write the total on the scoring-key line marked “PvB” (<a class="hlink" href="#page39">this page</a>).</p>
<div class="block">
<p class="bl_hanging">A total of 0 or 1 is very optimistic;</p>

<p class="bl_hanging">4 is average;</p>
<p class="bl_hanging">5 or 6 is moderately pessimistic; and</p>
<p class="bl_hanging">7 or 8 is very pessimistic.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now for the converse. <em>The optimistic explanatory style for good events is opposite that for bad events</em>. The optimist believes that bad events have <a id="page48"/>specific causes, while good events will enhance everything he does; the pessimist believes that bad events have universal causes and that good events are caused by specific factors. When Nora was offered temporary work back at the company, she thought: “They finally realized they can’t get along without me.” When Kevin got the same offer he thought: “They must really be shorthanded.”</p>

<h2 class="section" id="c03-s03">The Stuff of Hope</h2>
<p class="nonindent">H<span class="small">OPE HAS</span> largely been the province of preachers, of politicians, and of hucksters. The concept of explanatory style brings hope into the laboratory, where scientists can dissect it in order to understand how it works.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="c03-nts3a"/>Whether or not we have hope depends on two dimensions of our explanatory style: pervasiveness and permanence. Finding temporary and specific causes for misfortune is the art of hope: Temporary causes limit helplessness in time, and specific causes limit helplessness to the original situation. On the other hand, permanent causes produce helplessness far into the future, and universal causes spread helplessness through all your endeavors. Finding permanent and universal causes for misfortune is the practice of despair.</p>

<h3 class="section" id="c03-s03-s01"><em>Personalization: Internal vs. External</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">T<span class="small">HERE IS ONE</span> final aspect of explanatory style: <em>personalization</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">I once lived with a woman who blamed everything on me. Bad restaurant meals, late flights, even imperfect creases in her dry-cleaned trousers. “Sweetheart,” I said one day, in exasperation after being bawled out because her hair dryer didn’t work, “you are the most external person for bad events I’ve ever met.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Yes,” she shouted, “and it’s all your fault!”</p>
<p class="indent">When bad things happen, we can blame ourselves (internalize) or we can blame other people or circumstances (externalize). People who blame themselves when they fail have low self-esteem as a consequence. They think they are worthless, talentless, and unlovable. People who blame external events do not lose self-esteem when bad events strike. On the whole, they like themselves better than people who blame themselves do.</p>
<p class="indent">Low self-esteem usually comes from an internal style for bad events.</p>

<p class="indent">Of the three dimensions of explanatory style, personalization is the easiest to understand. After all, one of the first things a child learns to say is “He did it, not me!” Personalization is also the easiest dimension to overrate. It controls only how you <em>feel</em> about yourself, but pervasiveness and permanence—the more important dimensions—control what you <em>do:</em> how long you are helpless and across how many situations.</p>
<p class="indent">Personalization is the only dimension simple to fake. If I tell you to talk about your troubles in an external way now, you will be able to do it—even if you are a chronic internalizer. You can chatter along, pretending to blame your troubles on others. However, if you are a pessimist and I tell you to talk about your troubles as having temporary and specific causes, you will not be able to do it (unless you have mastered the techniques of Part Three, “Changing: From Pessimism to Optimism”).</p>
<p class="indent">Here’s one last piece of information for you, before you get your totals: <em>The optimistic style of explaining good events is the opposite of that used for bad events: It’s internal rather than external</em>. People who believe they cause good things tend to like themselves better than people who believe good things come from other people or circumstances.</p>

<h2 class="section" id="c03-s04"><a id="page52"/>Caveat about Responsibility</h2>
<p class="nonindent">A<span class="small">LTHOUGH</span> there are clear benefits to learning optimism—there are also dangers. Temporary? Local? That’s fine. I want my depressions to be short and limited. I want to bounce back quickly. But external? Is it right that I should blame others for my failures?</p>
<p class="indent">Most assuredly we want people to own up to the messes they make, to be responsible for their actions. Certain psychological doctrines have damaged our society by helping to erode personal responsibility: Evil is mislabeled insanity; bad manners are shucked off as neurosis; “successfully treated” patients evade their duty to their families because it does not bring them personal fulfillment. The question is whether or not changing beliefs about failure from internal to external (“It’s not my fault … it’s bad luck”) will undermine responsibility.</p>
<p class="indent">I am unwilling to advocate any strategy that further erodes responsibility. I don’t believe people should change their beliefs from internal to external wholesale. Nevertheless, there is one condition under which this usually should be done: depression. As we will see in the next chapter, depressed people often take much more responsibility for bad events than is warranted.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="c03-nts4a"/>There is a deeper matter to deal with here: the question of why people should own up to their failures in the first place. The answer, I believe, is that we want people to change, and we know they will not change if they do not assume responsibility. If we want people to change, internality is not as crucial as the permanence dimension is. If you believe the cause of your mess is permanent—stupidity, lack of talent, ugliness—you will not act to change it. You will not act to improve yourself. If, however, you believe the cause is temporary—a bad mood, too little effort, overweight—you can act to change it. If we want people to be responsible for what they do, then yes, we want them to have an internal style. More important, people must have a temporary style for bad events—they must believe that whatever the cause of the bad event, it can be changed.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c03-s05">What If You Are a Pessimist?</h2>
<p class="nonindent">I<span class="small">T MATTERS</span> a great deal if your explanatory style is pessimistic. If you scored poorly, there are four areas where you will encounter (and probably <a id="page53"/>already have encountered) trouble. First, as we will see in the next chapter, you are likely to get depressed easily. Second, you are probably achieving less at work than your talents warrant. Third, your physical health—and your immune function—are probably not what they should be, and this may get even worse as you get older. Finally, life is not as pleasurable as it should be. Pessimistic explanatory style is a misery.</p>
<p class="indent">If your pessimism score is in the average range, it will not be a problem in ordinary times. But in crisis, in the hard times life deals us all, you will likely pay an unnecessary price. When these events strike, you may find yourself getting more depressed than you should. How are you likely to react when your stocks go down, when you are rejected by someone you love, when you don’t get the job you want? As the next chapter shows, you will become very sad. The zest will go out of living. It will be very hard for you to get started on anything challenging. The future will look bleak to you. And you will be likely to feel this way for weeks or even months. You have probably felt this way several times already; most people have. This is so common that textbooks call it a normal reaction.</p>
<p class="indent">The commonness of being knocked flat by troubles, however, does not mean it is acceptable or that life has to be this way. If you use a different explanatory style, you’ll be better equipped to cope with troubled times and keep them from propelling you toward depression.</p>
<p class="indent">That hardly exhausts the prospective benefits of a new explanatory style. If you have an average degree of pessimism, you are going through life at a level somewhat lower than your talents would otherwise permit you. As you will see in chapters six, eight, and nine, even an average degree of pessimism drags down your performance in school, on the job, and in sports. This is true of physical health as well. Chapter ten illustrates how even if you are just ordinarily pessimistic, your health may not be up to par. You will likely suffer the chronic diseases of aging earlier and more severely than necessary. Your immune system may not work as well as it should; you will probably suffer more infectious diseases and recuperate more slowly.</p>
<p class="indent">If you use the techniques of chapter twelve, you will be able to choose to raise your everyday level of optimism. You should find yourself reacting to the normal setbacks of life much more positively and bouncing back from life’s large defeats much more briskly than you did before. You should achieve more on the job, in school, and on the playing field. And in the long run, even your body should serve you better.</p>
