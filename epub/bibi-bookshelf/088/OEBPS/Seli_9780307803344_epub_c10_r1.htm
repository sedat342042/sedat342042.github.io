<h1 class="chapter" id="c10"><a id="page167"/>10<br/><em>Health</em></h1>
<p class="nonindent"><a id="c10-nts1a"/>D<span class="small">ANIEL WAS</span> only nine when the doctors diagnosed him as having Burkitt’s lymphoma, a form of abdominal cancer. He was now ten, and in spite of an agonizing year of radiation and chemotherapy, the cancer was still spreading. His doctors and almost everyone else had given up hope. But not Daniel.</p>
<p class="indent">Daniel had plans. He was going to grow up to be a researcher, he told everyone, and discover how to cure diseases like this so other kids would be safe. Even as his body weakened, Daniel’s optimism remained strong.</p>
<p class="indent">Daniel lived in Salt Lake City. The main focus of his hope was a doctor he described as “the famous East Coast specialist.” This doctor, an authority on Burkitt’s lymphoma, had gotten interested in Daniel’s illness and had been consulting long-distance with Daniel’s doctors. He planned to stop in Salt Lake City on the way to a West Coast pediatrics meeting to meet Daniel and talk with his doctors.</p>
<p class="indent">Daniel had been excited for weeks. There was so much that he wanted to tell the specialist. He was keeping a diary, and he hoped the diary would give some clues about what his cure would be. He felt he was participating in his own treatment now.</p>
<p class="indent">On the day the specialist was to arrive, fog blanketed Salt Lake City and the airport closed down. The control tower sent the specialist’s plane over to Denver, and he decided to go directly on to San Francisco. When Daniel heard the news, he cried quietly. His parents and nurses told him to rest, and they promised to get the doctor by phone in San Francisco so Daniel could talk to him. But by the next morning Daniel was listless; he <a id="page168"/>had never been listless before. He had a high fever, and pneumonia set in. By evening he was in a coma. He died the next afternoon.</p>
<p class="indent">What do you make of a story like this? I’m sure it isn’t the first poignant tale you have heard of death following hope dashed, or of remission following hope gained. Such stories are told the world over, frequently enough to inspire the belief that hope is by itself life-sustaining and hopelessness life-destroying.</p>
<p class="indent">But there are other plausible interpretations. You might believe some third factor—for example, a well-tuned immune system—both saves life and engenders hope. Or you might believe that we as a species have such a deep desire to believe hope works miracles, we tell and retell the few cases that seem to prove it—but that are really coincidences—while suppressing the all-too-common stories going the other way around, with illness following hope and recovery following despair.</p>
<p class="indent">In the spring of 1976 a most unusual application for admission to our graduate program crossed my desk. In it, a woman named Madelon Visintainer, a nurse in Salt Lake City, narrated Daniel’s story. She said she had nursed several such cases, both among children with cancer and, in a reference she did not expand upon, during her “time in Vietnam.” Such “stories,” she said, could no longer be satisfactory evidence for her. She wanted to find out if it was really true that helplessness, by itself, could kill, and, if it could, to discover how. She wanted to come to the University of Pennsylvania and work with me, testing these questions first with animals, then taking the benefits to people.</p>
<p class="indent">Visintainer’s plain and unpretentious statement, the only one like it we had ever seen, moved one of the members of the admissions committee to tears. Furthermore, Visintainer’s grades and her Graduate Record Exam results were exemplary. There were, however, several holes in her application. From the dates she had given, it was hard to figure out where she had been at what time, or what she had done during several periods of her adult life. She just seemed to disappear every so often.</p>
<p class="indent">After some fruitless attempts to clear up these mysteries, we admitted Visintainer. I eagerly awaited her arrival in September 1976. She didn’t show up. She did call, saying something about needing to stay one more year in Salt Lake City, something about having to direct a grant on cancer. Directing a grant on cancer research was strange doings for a person who had claimed to be “just” a nurse. She asked if we would hold her place for the following September.</p>
<p class="indent">In turn, I asked her if she really wanted to come to the University of Pennsylvania and work on such an unfashionable topic. I warned her that few psychologists and almost no medical types believed that psychological <a id="page169"/>states like helplessness actually caused physical illness. She would be walking into an academic mine field, and she could expect one obstacle after another. She replied that she hadn’t been born yesterday and she knew what she was in for.</p>
<p class="indent">She did arrive in September 1977—as unadorned and plain-spoken as her application, and also as mysterious. She avoided conversation about her past or what she wanted to achieve in the future. But she did superbly in the present. She proved to be a scientific whirlwind. She undertook, as her first-year project, the awesome task of demonstrating that helplessness could cause death.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="c10-nts2a"/>She was tremendously excited by the new findings of Ellen Langer and Judy Rodin, then young health researchers at Yale. They had worked with elderly people in a nursing home, changing the amount of control the old people had over daily happenings in their lives.</p>
<p class="indent">They had divided the home by floors. On the first floor, the residents received extra control in their lives, and extra choice. One day, the director gave a speech to the residents: “I want you to know about all the things that you can do for yourself here at Shady Grove. There are omelettes or scrambled eggs for breakfast, but you have to choose which you want the night before. There are movies on Wednesday or Thursday night, but you have to sign up in advance. Here are some plants; pick one out and take it to your room—but you have to water it yourself.”</p>
<p class="indent">The director told the second floor: “I want you to know about all the good things we do for you here at Shady Grove. There are omelettes or scrambled eggs for breakfast. We make omelettes on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and scrambled eggs the other days. There are movies on Wednesday night and Thursday night. Residents from the left corridor go Wednesday and from the right Thursday. Here are some plants for your rooms. The nurse will pick one out for you and she’ll take care of it.”</p>
<p class="indent">So the extra good things the people on the first floor received were under their own control. The people on the second floor got the same added goodies, but nothing the residents did affected those goodies.</p>
<p class="indent">Eighteen months later, Langer and Rodin returned to the nursing home. They found that the group with choice and control was more active and happier, as measured by a variety of scales. They also found that fewer of this group than of the other had died. This amazing fact strongly indicated that choice and control could save lives and, perhaps, that helplessness could kill.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="c10-nts3a"/>Madelon Visintainer wanted to investigate this phenomenon in the laboratory, where conditions could be finely regulated, and to understand <em>how</em> mastery and helplessness could affect health. She took three groups of rats, <a id="page170"/>giving one group mild escapable shock, the second group mild inescapable shock, and the third group no shock at all. But the day before she did this, she implanted a few cells of a sarcoma on each rat’s flank. The tumor was of a type that is invariably lethal if it grows and is not rejected by the animal’s immune defenses. Visintainer had implanted just the right number of sarcoma cells so that, under normal conditions, 50 percent of the rats would reject the tumor and live.</p>
<p class="indent">This was a beautifully designed experiment. Everything physical was controlled: the amount and duration of shock; diet; housing; tumor load. The only thing that differed among the three groups was the psychological state they were in. One group was suffering learned helplessness, the second had experienced mastery, and the third was psychologically unchanged. If these three groups turned out to differ in ability to reject the tumor, only the psychological state could have caused the difference.</p>
<p class="indent">Within a month, 50 percent of the rats not shocked had died, and the other 50 percent of the no-shock rats had rejected the tumor; this was the normal ratio. As for the rats that mastered shock by pressing a bar to turn it off, 70 percent rejected the tumor. But only 27 percent of the helpless rats, the rats that had experienced uncontrollable shock, rejected the tumor.</p>
<p class="indent">Madelon Visintainer thus became the first person to demonstrate that a psychological state—learned helplessness—could <em>cause</em> cancer.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="c10-nts4a"/>Actually, almost the first. As Madelon was writing up her findings to submit to <em>Science</em>, the premier journal for major scientific breakthroughs, I opened up the latest issue. In it two Canadian researchers, Larry Sklar and Hymie Anisman from Ottawa, reported a similar experiment—they used mice rather than rats and measured the rate of tumor growth rather than ability to reject tumors—with the same results: Helplessness produced more rapid growth of tumors.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="c10-nts5a"/>Another of Madelon’s discoveries was about rats’ childhood (“weaninglinghood,” to purists). Madelon had found that rats who had experienced mastery when young would be immunized against tumors as adults. She had given young rats escapable shock, inescapable shock, or no shock and then waited until they were adults. She then implanted the sarcoma, divided each of the original groups into threes, and gave each new group escapable shock, inescapable shock, or no shock. Most of the rats that had learned helplessness when young failed to reject the tumor as adults, and most of the rats that escaped shock when young rejected the tumor as adults. So childhood experience proved to be crucial in tumor rejection by adults. Childhood mastery immunized, and early helplessness put adult rats at risk for cancer.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page171"/>When she completed her Ph.D., Madelon applied to various universities for an assistant professorship, and some of those universities had insisted on a complete vita from her. On seeing one I learned to my astonishment that she had already been an assistant professor of nursing at Yale before undertaking graduate training in psychology. I learned, further, that she had earned a Silver Star and sundry other decorations for courage under fire in Vietnam. She had run a hospital in Parrot’s Beak, Cambodia, during the 1970 incursion.</p>
<p class="indent">More I could not coax out of her. But now I understood something about the sources of the courage and strength of character she had needed back in 1976, to wade into the intellectual battlefield she had picked for herself. When Madelon entered her chosen field—psychological effects on physical health—it was the province of faith healers and hucksters. She wanted to demonstrate scientifically that mind could influence disease, and this ambition had been met through most of her nursing career with the jeers and disbelief of her medical colleagues. According to dogma, only physical processes, not mental processes, could influence disease. She turned to academe for a sympathetic hearing and support. By the time she turned in her landmark doctoral dissertation, she had helped prove that the mind can indeed control illness. And even the medical world was beginning to believe it. Today Madelon is chairperson of the Department of Pediatric Nursing at the Yale School of Medicine.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c10-s01">The Mind-Body Problem</h2>
<p class="nonindent">W<span class="small">HY DOES THE</span> possibility that mental life influences physical illness meet with such resistance? The answer reflects the knottiest of all the philosophical problems I know.</p>
<p class="indent">There are but two kinds of substance in the universe, argued the great seventeenth-century rationalist René Descartes: physical and mental. How do they act upon each other? We can see how one billiard ball hitting another causes it to move. But how does the mental act of willing your hand to move cause the physical movement of your hand? Descartes had his own quirky answer. He said that the mind runs the body via the pineal gland, a brain organ whose function is still not well understood. Descartes’ answer was wrong, and scientists and philosophers ever since have been trying to figure out by what path mental substance might influence physical substance.</p>
<p class="indent">Descartes was a dualist. He believed that the mental could affect the <a id="page172"/>physical. In due course an opposing school of thought developed, and it carried the day: materialism, whose adherents believed either that there is only one kind of substance—the physical—or who believed that there is mental substance but that it has no effects of its own. Almost all modern scientists and physicians are materialists. They resist to the death the notion that thought and emotion can affect the body. For them that is spiritualism. All claims that emotional and cognitive states influence illness run afoul of materialism.</p>
<p class="indent">I have wrestled for the last twenty years with three questions about health and hope. Each is at the frontier of the attempt to understand physical illness, an attempt that is a modern incarnation of the mind-body problem.</p>
<p class="indent">The first question concerns <em>cause</em>. Does hope actually sustain life? Do hopelessness and helplessness actually kill?</p>
<p class="indent">The second concerns <em>mechanism</em>. In this material world, how might hope and helplessness work? By what mechanism do matters so eminently spiritual touch matters so physical?</p>
<p class="indent">The third question is that of <em>therapy</em>. Can changing the way you think, changing your explanatory style, improve health and prolong life?</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c10-s02">Optimism and Good Health</h2>
<p class="nonindent">I<span class="small">N THE LAST</span> five years, laboratories around the world have produced a steady flow of scientific evidence that psychological traits, particularly optimism, can produce good health. This evidence makes sense of—and supersedes—the torrent of personal stories in which states ranging from laughter to the will to live appear to help health.</p>
<p class="indent">In four ways, the theory of learned helplessness strongly suggests that optimism should benefit health.</p>
<p class="indent">The first follows from Madelon Visintainer’s findings that learned helplessness in rats made them more susceptible to tumor growth. These findings were soon bolstered by more detailed work on the immune systems of helpless rats. The immune system, the body’s cellular defense against illness, contains different kinds of cells whose job is to identify and then kill foreign invaders, such as viruses, bacteria, and tumor cells. One kind, the T-cells, recognize specific invaders such as measles, then greatly multiply and kill the invaders. Another kind, natural killer cells (NK cells), kill anything foreign they happen across.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="c10-nts6a"/>Researchers looking at the immune systems of helpless rats found that <a id="page173"/>the experience of inescapable shock weakens the immune system. T-cells from the blood of rats that become helpless no longer multiply rapidly when they come across the specific invaders they are supposed to destroy. NK cells from the spleens of helpless rats lose their ability to kill foreign invaders.</p>
<p class="indent">These findings show that learned helplessness doesn’t just affect behavior; it also reaches down to the cellular level and makes the immune system more passive. This means one of the reasons Visintainer’s helpless rats did not fight off tumors might be that their very immune defenses had been weakened by the helplessness experience.</p>
<p class="indent">What does this mean in terms of explanatory style? Explanatory style is the great modulator of learned helplessness. As we saw earlier, optimists resist helplessness. They do not become depressed easily when they fail. They do not give up easily. Across a lifetime, an optimistic person will have fewer episodes of learned helplessness than a pessimistic person will. The less learned helplessness experienced, the better shape the immune system should be in. So the first way in which optimism might affect your health across your lifetime is by preventing helplessness and thereby <em>keeping immune defenses feistier</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">A second way in which optimism should produce good health concerns <em>sticking to health regimens and seeking medical advice</em>. Consider a pessimistic person who believes that sickness is permanent, pervasive, and personal. “Nothing I do matters,” he believes, “so why do anything?” Such a person is less likely to give up smoking, get flu shots, diet, exercise, go to the doctor when ill, or even follow medical advice. In a thirty-five-yearlong study of one hundred Harvard graduates, pessimists were in fact found to be less likely than optimists to give up cigarettes, and more likely to suffer illness. So optimists, who readily take matters into their own hands, are more likely to take action that prevents illness or get it treated once illness strikes.</p>
<p class="indent">A third way in which optimism should matter for health concerns the <em>sheer number of bad life events</em> encountered. It has been shown statistically that the more bad events a person encounters in any given time period, the more illness he will have. People who in the same six months move, get fired, and get divorced are at greater risk for infectious illness—and even for heart attacks and cancer—than are people who lead uneventful lives. This is why when major change occurs in your life, it is important to have physical checkups more frequently than usual. Even if you are feeling fine, it is particularly important to watch your health carefully when you change jobs, leave a relationship, or retire, or when someone you love dies. Widowers are several times more likely to die in the first six months <a id="page174"/>following the death of their wives than at any other time. If your mother dies, see to it that your father has at least one complete physical checkup soon afterward—it could extend his life.</p>
<p class="indent">Who, would you guess, encounters more bad events in life? Pessimists do. Because they are more passive, they are less likely to take steps to avoid bad events and less likely to do anything to stop them once they start. Putting two and two together, if pessimists have more bad events and if more bad events lead to more illness, pessimists should have more illness.</p>
<p class="indent">The final reason that optimists should have better health concerns <em>social support</em>. The capacity to sustain deep friendships and love seems to be important for physical health. Middle-aged people who have at least one person whom they can call in the middle of the night to tell their troubles to, go on to have better physical health than friendless people. Unmarried people are at higher risk for depression than couples. Even ordinary social contact is a buffer against illness. People who isolate themselves when they are sick tend to get sicker.</p>
<p class="indent">When my mother was in her mid-seventies, she had surgery which left her for a few months with a colostomy—an opening in her gut, which was attached to an external bag. Many people are squeamish about colostomies, and my mother was ashamed. She avoided her friends, stopped playing bridge, discouraged us from visiting, and stayed home alone until the colostomy was closed and the bag removed. Unfortunately, during her lonely period she suffered a return of tuberculosis, to which she had been exposed as a small child in Hungary. She experienced what is statistically a regular cost of loneliness: higher risk for disease, particularly the recrudescence of those diseases which never completely go away.</p>
<p class="indent">Pessimists have the same problem. They become passive more easily when trouble strikes, and they take fewer steps to get and sustain social support. The connection between lack of social support and illness provides a fourth reason to believe that optimistic explanatory style is likely to produce good health.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c10-s03">Pessimism, Ill Health, and Cancer</h2>
<p class="nonindent"><a id="c10-nts7a"/>T<span class="small">HE FIRST SYSTEMATIC</span> study of pessimism’s role in causing sickness was carried out by Chris Peterson. In the mid-1980s, when he was teaching abnormal psychology at Virginia Tech, Chris got his class of 150 students to fill out the ASQ. They also reported their health and the number of <a id="page175"/>visits they’d made to doctors in the recent past. Chris then followed the health of his students for the next year. He found that the pessimists went on to have twice as many infectious illnesses and make twice as many visits to doctors as the optimists did.</p>
<p class="indent">Was this just because pessimists complain more both on the questionnaire and about their aches and pains, rather than actually being physically sick more? No. Chris looked at the number of illnesses and visits to doctors <em>before</em> the students filled out the ASQ as well as after. The high rate of illness and visits to doctors among the pessimists occur over and above the earlier level of health.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="c10-nts8a"/>Other studies looked at breast cancer. In a pioneering British study, sixty-nine women with breast cancer were followed for five years. Women who did not suffer a recurrence tended to be those who responded to cancer with a “fighting spirit,” whereas those who died or who suffered a recurrence tended to respond to their initial diagnosis with helplessness and stoic acceptance.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="c10-nts9a"/>In a later study, thirty-four women visited the National Cancer Institute with their second bout of breast cancer. Each of them was interviewed at length about her life: marriage, children, job, and the disease. Surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy then began. We got these interviews and content-analyzed them for optimism, using the CAVE technique that we used before.</p>
<p class="indent">Long survival is unusual after two bouts of breast cancer, and after about a year, the women in the study began to die. Some died in a matter of months; others, a small minority, are alive today. Who survived the longest? Those who felt great joy in living and those with optimistic explanatory style.</p>
<p class="indent">Could it be merely that those optimistic women were also not as sick to begin with, and therefore lived longer because their cancer was less severe, not because of joy or optimism? No. The National Cancer Institute keeps invaluable, detailed records of severity of illness—Natural Killer cell activity, number of cancerous lymph nodes, degree of spread. The longevity benefits of joy and optimistic explanatory style occurred over and above the severity of illness.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="c10-nts10a"/>Such results did not go unchallenged. In 1985, in a widely publicized study of patients with terminal cancer, Barrie Cassileth found that no psychological variable made any difference to length of survival. In a special editorial in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>, associate editor Marcia Angell trumpeted this study as evidence that should lead us to “acknowledge that our belief in disease as a direct reflection of mental state is largely folklore.” Ignoring all the well-designed studies and citing the worst studies <a id="page176"/>she could find, Angell condemned the entire field of health psychology as perpetuating a “myth” that mind could influence disease. The materialists, seizing any straw to support the dogma that psychological states can never influence physical health, had a field day.</p>
<p class="indent">How can we reconcile Cassileth’s findings with the many studies that show psychological state affecting disease? First, Cassileth’s psychological tests were inadequate; she used fragments of well-established tests, rather than the whole tests. Concepts that usually require dozens of questions to measure were measured with one or two brief questions. Second, all of Cassileth’s patients were terminally ill. If you are hit by a Mack truck, your level of optimism is not going to make much difference. If you are hit by a bicycle, however, optimism could play a crucial role. I do not believe that when a patient has such a lethal load of cancer as to be deemed “terminal,” psychological processes can do much good. At the margin, however, when tumor load is small, when illness is beginning to progress, optimism might spell the difference between life and death. We have seen this in studies of the impact of bereavement and of optimism on the immune system.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c10-s03-s01"><em>The Immune System</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">M<span class="small">ATERIALISTS VIEW</span> the immune system as isolated from the psychology of the person in whom it resides. They believe that psychological variables like optimism and hope are as vaporous as spirit, so they are doubting Thomases about claims that optimism, depression, and bereavement all affect the immune system. They forget that the immune system is connected to the brain, and that states of mind, such as hope, have corresponding brain states that reflect the psychology of the person. These brain states then affect the rest of the body. So there is no mystery and no spiritualism involved in the process by which emotion and thought can affect illness.</p>
<p class="indent">The brain and the immune system are connected not through nerves but through hormones, the chemical messengers that drift through the blood and can transmit emotional state from one part of the body to another. It has been well documented that when a person is depressed the brain changes. Neurotransmitters, which are hormones that relay messages from one nerve to another, can become depleted. One set of transmitters, called catecholamines, becomes depleted during depression.</p>
<p class="indent">By what chain of physical events might the immune system sense that its host is pessimistic, depressed, or grieving? It turns out that when catecholamines <a id="page177"/>get depleted, other chemicals called endorphins—your body’s own morphine—increase activity. Cells of the immune system have receptors that sense the level of endorphins. When catecholamines are low, as in depression, endorphins go up; the immune system detects this and turns itself down.</p>
<p class="indent">Is this all just biological fancy or do depression, bereavement, and pessimism actually turn off the immune system?</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="c10-nts11a"/>About a decade ago a pioneering group of Australian researchers rounded up twenty-six men whose wives had just died from fatal injuries or illness. They persuaded each man to give blood twice, first one week and then again six weeks after their wives had died. Thus the researchers were able to look at the immune system during the course of grieving. They found that the immune system turned down during grieving. T-cells did not multiply as rapidly as usual. Over time the immune system began to recover. American research has since confirmed and extended these ground-breaking findings.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="c10-nts12a"/>Depression also seems to affect the way the immune system responds. Bad life events and depression were examined among thirty-seven women, along with the T-cells and NK cells from their blood. Women undergoing major life changes had lower NK activity than women whose lives were not in upheaval. The more depressed the women became, the worse their immune response.</p>
<p class="indent">If depression and grieving temporarily lower immune activity, then pessimism, a more chronic state, should lower immune activity in the longer run. Pessimistic individuals, as we saw in chapter five, get depressed more easily and more often. This might mean that pessimistic people generally have poorer immune activity.</p>
<p class="indent">To test this, Leslie Kamen, a graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania, and I worked with Judy Rodin, from Yale. Judy had been following the health of a large number of senior citizens living in and around New Haven, Connecticut. Several times each year these people, whose average age was seventy-one, gave long interviews about their nutrition, their health, and their grandchildren. Once a year they gave blood so their immune systems could be checked. We rated the interviews for pessimism, and then we looked at the next blood draw to see if we could predict immune activity. As we expected, the optimists had better immune activity than the pessimists. In addition, we found that neither their health nor their depression level at the time of the interview predicted immune response. Pessimism itself seemed to lower immune activity, unmediated by health or depression.</p>
<p class="indent">Taken together, all this evidence makes it clear that your psychological <a id="page178"/>state can change your immune response. Bereavement, depression, and pessimism all can lower your immune system’s activity. Exactly how this works has yet to be precisely determined, but there is one likely path: As mentioned earlier, some of the brain’s neurotransmitters get depleted during these states; this turns up the brain’s level of internal morphine. The immune system has receptors for these hormones and shuts down when endorphin activity rises.</p>
<p class="indent">If your level of pessimism can deplete your immune system, it seems likely that pessimism can impair your physical health over your whole life span.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c10-s04">Optimism and a Healthier Life</h2>
<p class="nonindent">I<span class="small">S IT POSSIBLE</span> that optimists live longer than pessimists? Is it more likely that if you have an optimistic explanatory style while you are young, you will be healthier for the rest of your life?</p>
<p class="indent">This is not an easy question to answer scientifically. It will not do to point to the legions of very old people and show that the majority are optimists. They may be optimists because they have lived long and been healthy, rather than the other way around.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="c10-nts13a"/>Before we could answer this question, we had to answer several others. First we needed to find out if explanatory style is stable across a whole lifetime. If optimism while you are young is to affect your health into old age, it should be the case that your level of optimism lasts a lifetime. To investigate this, Melanie Burns, a graduate student at the university, and I advertised in senior citizens’ publications for people who still had diaries they kept when they were teenagers. Thirty people answered our ad and turned their diaries over to us. We “CAVEd” them, creating a teenage explanatory-style profile for each person. In addition, each volunteer wrote a long essay for us on his or her life now: his health, his family, his work. We “CAVEd” this as well, and formed a separate old-age explanatory-style profile. How did the two profiles relate?</p>
<p class="indent">We found that explanatory style for good events was completely changeable across fifty years. The same person could, for example, at one point in life regard good events as due to blind fate and at another time as due to his own skill. But we found that explanatory style for bad events was highly stable across a period of more than fifty years. The women who as teenagers wrote that the boys were not interested in them because they were “unlovable” wrote fifty years later that they were “unlovable” when <a id="page179"/>their grandchildren didn’t visit. The way we look at bad events—our theory of tragedy—remains fixed across our lifetime.</p>
<p class="indent">This key finding moved us closer to the point when we could ask if the explanatory style of a young person affects health much later in life. What else did we need before we could ask this question?</p>
<p class="extract1"><a id="c10-nts14a"/>We needed a large group of individuals with certain characteristics:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li>While young they had to have made a quantity of causal statements that had survived and could be “CAVEd.”</li>
<li>We had to be sure they were healthy and successful when they made these youthful pronouncements. This was necessary because if they were already unhealthy, or already failures, it might have made them pessimistic as well as less healthy later. And if that were so, optimism early in life would correlate with longer, healthier lives, but perhaps only because early ill health or early failure produces unhealthier lives. Hardly worth writing home about.</li>
<li>We also needed subjects who had had regular physical checkups so we could chart their health across their life span.</li>
<li>Finally, we needed subjects who were quite old now, so there would be a lifetime of health to predict.</li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">That was asking quite a lot. Where could we find such people?</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c10-s05">The Grant Study Men</h2>
<p class="nonindent">G<span class="small">EORGE</span> V<span class="small">AILLANT</span> is a psychoanalyst I admire greatly. In 1978–79, he and I had been “classmates” at a think tank, the Center for Advanced Studies in the Behavioral Sciences, in Stanford, California. From psychoanalysis George had extracted the notion of defense, and he ran with it. What happens to us across our lives, he argued, is not a result of the sheer number of misfortunes that befall us but of how we defend against them mentally. He also thought our habits of explaining misfortunes were among our defenses, and he had tested his theories on a unique sample. George has spent more than a decade tracking down an extraordinary group of men and interviewing them as they grew through middle age into the beginning of old age.</p>
<p class="indent">In the mid-1930s, the William T. Grant Foundation decided to study healthy people across the whole adult span of their lives. The originators <a id="page180"/>of the study wanted to follow a group of exceptionally gifted individuals to learn about the determinants of success and good health, and so they winnowed five Harvard freshmen classes, looking for men who were physically very fit and intellectually and socially gifted. On the basis of extensive testing they picked out two hundred men—about 5 percent of the classes of 1939 through 1944—and have followed them ever since. These men, who are now nearing seventy, have for fifty years cooperated fully with this demanding study. They receive extensive physical checkups every five years, are interviewed periodically, and endlessly fill out questionnaires. They have produced a gold mine of information about what makes a person healthy and successful.</p>
<p class="indent">When the originators of the Grant study themselves grew too old to continue, they looked for a successor young enough to carry the study on to the end of the subjects’ lives. It was the time of the twenty-fifth reunion of the Harvard men. The originators chose George, then in his early thirties and one of America’s most promising young research psychiatrists.</p>
<p class="indent">George’s first important finding from the Grant study was that wealth at age twenty does not guarantee health or success. There is a high rate of failure and poor health among these men: failed marriages, bankruptcy, premature heart attacks, alcoholism, suicide, and other tragedy—indeed, one man was assassinated. These men experienced just about the same rate of heartbreak and mortal shock as men who were born at the same time in the inner city. George’s theoretical challenge has been to try to predict and understand who among his subjects would have good lives and whose lives will go sour.</p>
<p class="indent">As I have said, his main concern has been what he calls defenses: the characteristic way in which people deal with bad events. Some of the men, while in college, handled failure with “mature defenses”—humor, altruism, sublimation. Others never did: For example, when their girlfriends broke up with them, they used denial, projection, and other “immature defenses.” Remarkably, those men who had mature defenses in their early twenties went on to much more successful and healthy lives. By age sixty, none of the men who had deployed mature defenses at twenty were chronically ill; whereas over one-third of the men without mature defenses at twenty were in poor health by sixty.</p>
<p class="indent">Here, then, was the group we wanted. They had made documented causal statements while young; they were successful and healthy when they made these statements; their health had been followed religiously for a lifetime; and they were now in late middle age. In addition, a great deal of other information about their personalities and their lives was known. Would the optimists among them lead healthier lives than the pessimists? Would they live longer?</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page181"/>George generously agreed to work with Chris Peterson and me. George believes that he is custodian of a precious and unique sample, and he “lends” it (ever vigilant to protect the anonymity of his men) to other serious scientists who wish to find the predictors of health and success across the life span.</p>
<p class="indent">We decided to use the “sealed-envelope” technique. George saw to it that we worked in complete ignorance of who the men were and which ones had turned out to be healthy. First he picked, by random sample, half (ninety-nine) of the men and gave us essays they had written when they returned in 1945–46 from the Second World War. These were rich documents—full of explanations, pessimistic and optimistic:</p>
<div class="block">
<p class="bl_indent">“The ship went down because the admiral was so stupid.”</p>
<p class="bl_indent">“I could never get along with the men because they resented my privileged Harvard background.”</p>
</div>
<p class="nonindent">We “CAVEd” all the essays and compiled an explanatory-style portrait of each of the men at the end of their youth.</p>
<p class="indent">Then one snowy day, Chris and I flew up to Dartmouth, where George is a professor of psychiatry, to open the so-called sealed envelope—that is, to learn how the lives of the men we had worked on had worked out. What we saw was that health at age sixty was strongly related to optimism at age twenty-five. The pessimistic men had started to come down with the diseases of middle age earlier and more severely than the optimistic men, and the differences in health by age forty-five were already large. Before age forty-five optimism has no effect on health. Until that age the men remained in the same state of health as at age twenty-five. But at age forty-five the male body starts its decline. How fast and how severely it does so is well predicted by pessimism twenty-five years earlier. What’s more, when we fed several other factors—the subject’s defenses and their physical and mental health at age twenty-five—into the equation, optimism still stood out as a primary determinant of health, beginning at age forty-five and continuing for the next twenty years. These men are just entering the time of mortality, and so in the next decade we will be able to find out if optimism predicts a longer life as well as a healthier one.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c10-s06">The Mind-Body Problem Revisited</h2>
<p class="nonindent">T<span class="small">HERE IS</span> convincing evidence that psychological states do affect your health. Depression, grieving, pessimism: All seem to worsen health in both <a id="page182"/>the short run and the long term. What’s more, it is no longer a complete mystery how this might work. There is a plausible chain of events that starts with bad life events and ends up in poor health.</p>
<p class="indent">The chain begins with a particular set of bad events—loss, failure, defeat—those events that make you feel helpless. As we have seen, everyone reacts to such events with at least momentary helplessness, and people with a pessimistic explanatory style become depressed. Depression produces catecholamine depletion and increases in endorphin secretion. Endorphin increases can lower the activity of the immune system. The body is at all times exposed to pathogens—agents of disease—normally held in check by the immune system. When the immune system is partly shut down by the catecholamine-endorphin link, these pathogens can go wild. Disease, sometimes life-threatening, becomes more likely.</p>
<p class="indent">Each link of the <em>loss-pessimism-depression-catecholamine depletion-endorphin secretion depletion-immune suppression-disease</em> chain is testable, and for each we already have evidence of its operation. This chain of events involves no spirits and no mysterious, unmeasurable processes. What’s more, if this is actually the chain, therapy and prevention can work at each link.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c10-s07">Psychological Prevention and Therapy</h2>
<p class="nonindent">“T<span class="small">HIS IS A</span> once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,” Judy Rodin said. “We should not propose to do something safe. We should propose what we have always yearned to do.” Judy, with whom I had worked on the New Haven study of the effects of pessimism on the immune system, was vexed. Here was a small group of prominent scientists, the world leaders in health psychology, facing the prospect of at last having enough money to make their scientific dreams come true—but where were the big dreams?</p>
<p class="indent">Judy is a prodigy: a chaired professor at Yale, president of the Eastern Psychological Association, and a member of the prestigious National Institute of Medicine, all before her fortieth birthday. Her role this afternoon was as leader of the MacArthur Foundation Network on health and behavior. She had called us together to tell us, that frigid winter morning in New Haven, that she thought the time was ripe to ask the MacArthur Foundation to support the fledgling field of psychoneuroimmunology, the study of how psychological events change health and the immune system. “The MacArthur Foundation is not stodgy,” she said. “They are looking for the kind of project to support that could change the face of medicine <a id="page183"/>but is too adventurous for normal funders—like the National Institutes of Health—to take seriously. And we’re dredging up the same routine science that we submit every three years to NIH for funding. What do you really—in your heart of hearts—want to do but have been afraid to propose to the establishment?”</p>
<p class="indent">The usually shy and soft-spoken Sandra Levy, a young professor of psychological oncology from Pittsburgh, spoke up. “What I’d really like to do,” she said with emotion, “is to try therapy and prevention. Judy and Marty have convinced us that pessimistic explanatory style produces lousy immune functioning and poor health. There is a plausible chain by which this might happen. And there is convincing evidence that cognitive therapy changes explanatory style. Let’s intervene at the psychological link. Let’s change explanatory style, and, yes, read my lips, cure cancer.”</p>
<p class="indent">There was a long, embarrassed silence. Almost no one outside that room would have believed that a psychological therapy could boost a poorly working immune system. Few people would ever have believed that a psychological therapy could cure cancer. To the rest of the profession, this would be seen as quackery, flying in the face of accepted medical treatment. And nothing can kill a hard-won reputation as a careful scientist quite as quickly as intimations of quackery. Psychotherapy to treat a physical disease, indeed.</p>
<p class="indent">I gathered my courage and broke the silence. “I agree with Sandy,” I said, not quite certain what I was getting us into. “If Judy wants something visionary, if she wants dreams, okay, let’s try to change the immune system by psychological means. If we’re wrong, we’ll have wasted a couple of years of our time. If we’re right, and if we can convince the establishment by doing an impeccable study—a very big <em>if</em>—this will revolutionize the health system.”</p>
<p class="indent">That morning, Judy Rodin, Sandra Levy, and I resolved to try it. First came a request to the foundation to support pilot work on cognitive therapy to boost the immune system. This was quickly approved, and over the next two years, we treated forty patients in the throes of melanoma and colon cancer, two quite severe forms of cancer. These patients continued to get their normal chemotherapy and radiation. In addition, once a week for twelve weeks they got a modified form of cognitive therapy. We designed their therapy not to cure depression but to arm these patients with new ways of thinking about loss: recognizing automatic thoughts; distraction; disputing pessimistic explanations. (See <a class="hlink" href="Seli_9780307803344_epub_c12_r1.htm">chapter twelve</a>.) We supplemented cognitive therapy with relaxation training for handling stress. We also created a control group of cancer patients who received the same physical therapies but no cognitive therapy or relaxation training.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page184"/>“Holy cow! You should see these numbers.” I have never heard Sandy as excited as she was on the phone that November morning, two years later. “The Natural Killer cell activity is up <em>very</em> sharply in the cancer patients who got cognitive therapy. Not at all in the controls. Holy cow!”</p>
<p class="indent">In short, cognitive therapy strongly enhanced immune activity—just as we hoped it would.</p>
<p class="indent">It is still too early to know if this therapy changed the course of the disease or saved the lives of these cancer patients. The disease runs a much slower course than the immune activity, which can change from day to day. Time will tell. But this pilot study was enough for the MacArthur Foundation. Adventurous souls that they are, they agreed to support the long-range project. Starting in 1990 we will be giving cognitive therapy to cancer patients on a larger scale, trying to boost their immune systems and deflect the disease—and perhaps even lengthening their lives.</p>
<p class="indent">Just as exciting, we will be trying prevention. We will be giving the exercises you’ll find in chapter twelve to people at high risk for disease: newly divorced or separated individuals and military recruits in Arctic cold. These people ordinarily suffer unusually high rates of illness. Will changing pessimistic explanatory style bolster their immune defenses and prevent physical illness?</p>
<p class="indent">We have high hopes.</p>
