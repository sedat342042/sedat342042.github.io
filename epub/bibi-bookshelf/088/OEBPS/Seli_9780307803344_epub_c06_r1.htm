<h1 class="chapter" id="c06"><a id="page94"/><a id="page95"/>6<br/><em>Success at Work</em></h1>
<p class="nonindent">O<span class="small">N LONG FLIGHTS</span>, I usually take the window seat and curl up facing the window, mostly to avoid having to make conversation with my seatmate. I was annoyed one day in March 1982, at the beginning of flight 79 from San Francisco to Philadelphia, to find that my tactics were of no avail. “Hi,” my seatmate, a balding sixty-year-old, said heartily. “My name is John Leslie. What’s yours?” He pushed his hand at mine. “Oh no,” I said to myself, “a gabby one.” I mumbled my name and gave him a perfunctory handshake, hoping he’d get the message.</p>
<p class="indent">Leslie would not be denied. “I raise horses,” he said as the plane taxied down the runway. “When I come to a crossroad, all I have to do is think which way I want the horse to go, and he goes that way. In my job, I raise men—and all I have to do is think what I want them to do, and they do it.”</p>
<p class="indent">Thus began the chance, uninvited conversation which started a dramatic shift in the focus of my work.</p>
<p class="indent">Leslie was persistent, a full-blown optimist who seemed to have no doubt that I would be enthralled by his words of wisdom. And in fact, as the plane neared Nevada, with the snowcapped Sierras beneath us, I found myself being drawn in. “My people,” he announced, “developed the video recorder for Ampex. That was the most creative group I ever led.”</p>
<p class="indent">“What separates your creative groups from your turkeys?” I asked.</p>
<p class="indent">“Each person,” he said, “every one of them, believes he can walk on water.”</p>
<p class="indent">By Utah, I was hooked. What he was telling me matched what I had been seeing in people who resisted depression.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page96"/>“How can you make someone creative?” I asked him.</p>
<p class="indent">“I’ll show you,” he replied. “But first, what do you do for a living?”</p>
<p class="indent">I gave him a brief rundown on what I had been up to for the last fifteen years. I told him about helpless people and animals and how helplessness had proved to be a model for depression. I told him about pessimistic explanatory style and the pessimists who gave up so easily moments after experiencing loss of control. “These were the people,” I said, “who, outside the lab, came down with serious depression.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Have you done much work about the other side of the coin?” Leslie asked. “Can you predict who’ll never give up and who won’t become depressed no matter what you do to them?”</p>
<p class="indent">“I haven’t thought about them enough,” I confessed.</p>
<p class="indent">Actually, I had been uneasy for some time about psychology’s fixation upon disease. My profession spends most of its time (and almost all of its money) trying to make the troubled less troubled. Helping troubled people is a worthy goal, but somehow psychology almost never gets around to the complementary goal of making the lives of well people even better. With Leslie’s prompting I was beginning to see that my work was germane to the other goal. If I could identify in advance the people who would get depressed, I should also be able to identify those who never would.</p>
<p class="indent">John asked whether I could think of some business pursuits in which it was essential to keep going in the face of constant rejection and failure.</p>
<p class="indent">“Maybe sales,” I replied, thinking of a speech I’d given a few months before to a group of insurance-company presidents. “Selling life insurance, say.” In life insurance, they’d told me, nine out of ten prospects brush you off. You have to pick yourself up and keep going just to get to the tenth. It’s like hitting against a great pitcher: Most of the time you swing and miss, but to get on base you’ve got to keep swinging. If you keep the bat on your shoulder, you always strike out.</p>
<p class="indent">I thought back to a conversation I’d had that weekend with John Creedon, the head of Metropolitan Life. After my speech Creedon asked me if psychology had anything to tell the corporation manager. Could we, for example, help him pick out the people who could successfully sell insurance? And could we develop ways to change foot-dragging pessimists into “Yes, I can” optimists? I had told Creedon I did not know. I now narrated that conversation to Leslie, and by the time we began our descent to Philadelphia, he had me promising to write Creedon a letter. And I did write him, to say that I thought we could perhaps pick out future successes.</p>
<p class="indent">I never saw Leslie again. Soon after he buoyantly suggested that I shift my attention from pessimism to optimism, from failure to success, I did just that. My subsequent research showed repeatedly that optimists do <a id="page97"/>better in school, win more elections, and succeed more at work than pessimists do. They even seem to lead longer and healthier lives. As a therapist and a teacher of therapists I found that pessimism can be changed into optimism, not just in depressed people but in normal people as well.</p>
<p class="indent">It often occurred to me that I owed Leslie a letter. If I’d written it, I’d have told him about my research on optimism.</p>
<p class="indent">Consider the rest of this book that letter.</p>
<p class="extract">T<span class="small">HREE WEEKS</span> after that flight, I found myself high in one of Metropolitan Life’s twin towers in Manhattan, treading the deepest-pile woolen carpets I had ever trod into the gleaming, oak-paneled inner sanctum of John Creedon. A cheerful and perceptive man in his mid-fifties, he had grasped the potential of optimism for his industry long before I had. He explained the perennial problem that Metropolitan and all insurance companies have with their sales forces.</p>
<p class="indent">“Selling is not easy,” he began. “It requires persistence. It’s an unusual person who can do it well and stick with it. Every year we hire five thousand new agents. We select them very carefully out of the sixty thousand people who apply. We test them, we screen them, we interview them, we give them extensive training. But half of them quit anyway in the first year. Most of those who stay on produce less and less. By the end of the fourth year eighty percent are gone. It costs us more than thirty thousand dollars to hire a single agent. So we lose over seventy-five million dollars every year in hiring costs alone. And our figures are typical of the whole industry.</p>
<p class="indent">“I’m not just talking about money Met Life loses, Dr. Seligman,” he continued. “Whenever an employee quits a job, I’m talking about human misery, about your field—depression. When fifty percent of a whole industry quits every year, there’s an important humanitarian mission here—to try to better the ‘person-environment fit.’</p>
<p class="indent">“What I want to know is, can your test pick out in advance the people who will make the best agents, so we can stem this flow of wasted human capital?”</p>
<p class="indent">“Why does quitting typically happen?” I asked.</p>
<p class="indent">Creedon outlined the process of giving up. “Every single day even the best agent has quite a few people say no, usually a number of them right in a row. So it’s easy for the average agent to get discouraged. Once they get discouraged, they take the no’s harder and harder; it takes more and more effort for them to get up and make the next call. They put off making that next call. They spend more and more time fiddling around and doing things that keep them away from the telephone and off the road. This <a id="page98"/>makes it even harder to make the next call. Their production falls off, and they start to think about quitting. When they hit that wall, few of them know how to get over, under, or around it.</p>
<p class="indent">“Remember,” he said, “these are people with a lot of independence—that’s one of the attractions of the business—so we aren’t looking over their shoulders constantly and prodding them when they slow down. Remember this, too: Only those agents who keep making their ten calls each day, and don’t get fazed by rejection, succeed.”</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c06-s01">The Explanatory Style of Success</h2>
<p class="nonindent">I <span class="small">EXPLAINED</span> the theory of learned helplessness and explanatory style to Creedon. Then I told him about the optimism/pessimism questionnaire (see chapter three). Time and time again, I said, it has been shown that people who score pessimistically on the questionnaire give up easily and become depressed.</p>
<p class="indent">But the questionnaire, I went on, doesn’t identify just pessimists. Its scores are continuous and range from deeply pessimistic to irrepressibly optimistic. The people who score at the very optimistic end, I said, should be the most persistent. They’re the most immune to helplessness. They should never give up, no matter how much rejection and failure they encounter.</p>
<p class="indent">“These invulnerable optimists have never really been looked at before,” I said, “and they may be exactly the people who’ll succeed in a job as challenging as selling insurance.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Tell me exactly how optimism could help,” Creedon replied. “Let’s take cold calling, a crucial part of selling life insurance. In cold calling, you have a list of possible prospects, like the names of all the parents of new babies in a town. You start calling, from the top of the list, and you try to make a face-to-face appointment. Most people say, ‘No, I’m not interested’—or even just hang up on you.”</p>
<p class="indent">I explained that optimistic explanatory style should affect not what the insurance agent says to prospects but what he says to himself when the prospect says no. Pessimistic salesmen, I told Creedon, will say permanent, pervasive, and personal things to themselves, like “I’m no good” or “No one wants to buy insurance from me” or “I can’t even get to first base.” This undoubtedly will produce the giving-up response and make it harder to dial the next prospect. After several such episodes, I predicted, the pessimistic agent will quit for the evening—and eventually quit altogether.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page99"/>The optimistic agent, on the other hand, will talk to himself in more constructive ways: “He was too busy right now,” or “They already have insurance, but eight of ten people are underinsured,” or “I called during supper.” Or he’ll say nothing at all to himself. The next call won’t be any harder to make, and within a few minutes the agent will have gotten through to the one person in ten, on average, who makes an appointment. This will energize the agent, so he’ll breeze through the next ten calls and get another appointment. In this way he’ll live up to his selling potential.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="c06-nts1a"/>Even before I walked in his door, Creedon, like many other insurance executives, knew that optimism was the key to sales success. He had been waiting for someone who could measure it. We decided to start with a simple correlational study, to see if already successful salesmen were also extremely optimistic. If they were, we would proceed step by step. Our eventual aim was to create a whole new way of selecting the sales force. We used a questionnaire different from the questionnaire you took in chapter three. In this open-ended ASQ (Attributional Style Questionnaire) are twelve vignettes, little scenarios. Half are about bad events (e.g., “You go out on a date, and it goes badly.…”), and half are about good events</p>
<p class="indent">(e.g., “You suddenly become rich.…”). You are asked to imagine the event happening to you and to fill in the most likely cause. For example, to explain the first vignette you might say, “I have bad breath,” and for the second, “I’m a brilliant investor.”</p>
<p class="indent">You are then asked to rate the cause you supplied, on a one-to-seven scale, for personalization. (“Is this cause something about other people or circumstances [external], or is it something about you [internal]?”) You’re then asked to rate it for permanence. (“Will this cause never again be present when looking for a job [temporary] or always be present [permanent]?”) And finally you rate it for pervasiveness. (“Does this cause affect only looking for a job [specific] or all other areas of your life [pervasive]?”)</p>
<p class="indent">For our first try, we gave the questionnaire to two hundred experienced sales agents, half of whom were eagles (very productive) and half turkeys (unproductive). The eagles scored much more optimistically on the questionnaire than the turkeys did. When we matched test scores to actual sales records, we found that agents who scored in the most optimistic half of the ASQ had sold 37 percent more insurance on average in their first two years of work than agents who scored in the pessimistic half.</p>
<p class="indent">Agents who scored in the top 10 percent sold 88 percent more than the most pessimistic tenth. In our quest to find out how useful our test might be in the world of business, this was an encouraging beginning.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c06-s02"><a id="page100"/>Testing for Talent</h2>
<p class="nonindent">O<span class="small">VER MANY YEARS</span> the insurance industry developed a test meant to discover a person’s suitability for a sales career. The Career Profile is published by the Life Insurance Management Research Association. All applicants to Met Life must take a Career Profile, and to be hired they need to score 12 or better. Only the top 30 percent of applicants attain this score. Those who get a 12 or better are interviewed, and if the manager likes what he sees, they are offered a job.</p>
<p class="indent">In general, for any line of work two kinds of questionnaires can predict potential for success: empirical and theory-based. An empirical test starts with people who have, in fact, succeeded on the job and people who have, in fact, failed. It throws a large number of random questions at them, covering all of life: “Do you like classical music?” “Do you want to earn a lot of money?” “Do you have a lot of relatives?” “How old are you?” “Do you like to go to parties?” Most of the questions don’t separate the eagles from the turkeys, but a few hundred will turn out to. (You just determine which questions happen to work and use those; no theory at all is involved.) These few hundred questions become the test items used to predict future successes at that job. The suitable applicant will have to have the same “profile”—the same sets of ages, backgrounds and attitudes, in short, the same answers—as the typical successful worker already in that field. Empirical tests, then, in effect admit at the outset that why someone succeeds is a complete mystery; they merely use the questions that happen to separate eagles from turkeys.</p>
<p class="indent">Theory-based tests, on the other hand, like IQ tests or the SAT, ask only questions deduced from a theory—in this case, a theory of ability. The theory behind the SAT, for example, is that “intelligence” consists of verbal skills (reading comprehension, ability to understand analogies, etc.) and of mathematical-analytic skills (algebra, geometry, etc.). Since these skills are fundamental to how you do schoolwork, performing well on them should predict future success in school. And it does, quite respectably.</p>
<p class="indent">But both empirical and theory-based tests make a notoriously large number of mistakes, even though on the whole they predict with statistical accuracy. Many people who score poorly on the SATs will do well in college, and many people who score well will flunk out. Even more obvious was Met Life’s problem: A great many people who score well on the Career Profile sell poorly. But could many of those who scored poorly on the Career Profile go on to sell insurance well? Met Life didn’t know, since it <a id="page101"/>hired almost none of them. The company was therefore left with jobs open, since not enough applicants could pass the Career Profile. If a substantial number of applicants failed the industry test but would sell as much insurance as those who passed it, Met Life could solve its severe manpower problem.</p>
<p class="indent">The ASQ is a theory-based test, but it is based on a theory very different from traditional wisdom about success. Traditional wisdom holds that there are two ingredients of success, and you need both to succeed. The first is ability or aptitude, and IQ tests and the SAT are supposed to measure it. The second is desire or motivation. No matter how much aptitude you have, says traditional wisdom, if you lack desire you will fail. Enough desire can make up for meager talent.</p>
<p class="indent">I believe the traditional wisdom is incomplete. A composer can have all the talent of a Mozart and a passionate desire to succeed, but if he believes he cannot compose music, he will come to nothing. He will not try hard enough. He will give up too soon when the elusive right melody takes too long to materialize. Success requires persistence, the ability to not give up in the face of failure. I believe that optimistic explanatory style is the key to persistence.</p>
<p class="indent">The explanatory-style theory of success says that in order to choose people for success in a challenging job, you need to select for three characteristics:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li>aptitude</li>
<li>motivation</li>
<li>optimism</li>
</ol>
<p class="nonindent">All three determine success.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c06-s03">Testing Explanatory Style at Met Life</h2>
<p class="nonindent">T<span class="small">HERE ARE</span> two possible explanations of why in our first study the good sales agents had more optimistic ASQ scores than the bad agents. One explanation confirms the theory that optimism produces success; it says that optimism causes you to sell well and pessimism makes you sell badly. The other explanation is that selling well makes you optimistic and selling badly makes you pessimistic.</p>
<p class="indent">Our next step was to find out which causes which, by measuring optimism at the time of hiring and seeing who went on to do best over the next year. <a id="page102"/>To test our theory, we took the first 104 agents hired in western Pennsylvania in January 1983. All had already passed the Career Profile and received their preappointment training. Each then took the ASQ. We thought we’d have to wait a year until the production data came in to find out anything important. As it happened, we had no wait.</p>
<p class="indent">We were stunned by how optimistic new insurance agents are. Their group average G–B score (the difference between explanatory style for good events and explanatory style for bad events) was over 7.00. This is far above the national average and suggests that all but the most optimistic need not apply. Life insurance agents, as a group, are more optimistic than people from any other walk of life we have ever tested: car salesmen, commodity traders who scream all day long in the pits, West Point plebes, managers of Arby’s restaurants, the candidates for the office of President of the United States during this century, major-league baseball stars, or world-class swimmers.<a class="hlink" href="#c06-ftn4" id="c06-ftn4a"><sup class="frac">*</sup></a> We had picked exactly the right profession to start with, one that requires very strong optimism just to enter and extreme optimism to succeed in.</p>
<p class="indent">One year later we looked at how the agents fared. As John Creedon had warned us, more than half the agents had quit; 59 of the 104 quit during the first year.</p>
<p class="indent">Who quit?</p>
<p class="indent">Agents who scored in the less optimistic half of the ASQ were twice as likely to quit as agents who scored in the more optimistic half. Agents who scored in the least optimistic quarter were three times likelier to quit than agents who scored in the most optimistic quarter. In contrast, the people with the lowest scores on the Career Profile weren’t any likelier to quit than those with high scores.</p>
<p class="indent">How about the bottom line, dollars produced?</p>
<p class="indent">The agents from the top half of the ASQ sold 20 percent more insurance than the less optimistic agents from the bottom half. The agents from the top quarter sold 50 percent more than the agents from the bottom quarter. Here the Career Profile was predictive as well. Agents who scored in the top half of the Career Profile sold 37 percent more than agents who scored in the bottom half. Taking the two tests together (they don’t duplicate each other; each contributes its own distinct perspective), we saw that agents who scored in the upper half of both sold 56 percent more than agents who scored in the bottom half of both. So optimism predicted who survived, and it predicted who sold the most—and it did so about as well as the industry test.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page103"/>Did this study adequately test the theory and the power of optimism to predict sales success? No. Several questions still needed answering before Met Life would be completely convinced that the ASQ predicts success as a salesman. First, only 104 people were studied, and the sample, coming entirely from western Pennsylvania, might have been unrepresentative. Second, the agents took the test under no pressure at all, because they had already been hired. What if Met Life now began to hire agents using the ASQ and some applicants, knowing that getting hired depended on how well they did, tried to fake their answers? If they succeeded, that would invalidate the test.</p>
<p class="indent">It was fairly easy to erase our worry about cheating. We ran a special study in which certain test-takers were told how to cheat (“Just appear as optimistic as you can”) and given an incentive to cheat as well—a $100 reward for the best score. But even with knowledge and incentive, they scored no higher than their fellow test-takers. In other words, this is a hard test to cheat on, and being coached to appear as optimistic as possible doesn’t work. Even if you study this book, you will find it difficult to cheat effectively on our optimism tests, since the right answers vary from test to test and we include “lie scales” to pick out cheaters.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c06-s04">The Special Force Study</h2>
<p class="nonindent">W<span class="small">E WERE NOW</span> ready for a full-blown study in which the applicants took the test under real hiring conditions. In early 1985, fifteen thousand applicants to Met Life nationwide took both the ASQ and the Career Profile.</p>
<p class="indent">We had two goals. The first was to hire one thousand agents by the usual criterion, passing the Career Profile. For these thousand agents, the ASQ score did not enter into the hiring decision. We wanted only to see if the optimists on this regular force would go on to outsell the pessimists.</p>
<p class="indent">The second goal was much riskier for Met Life. We decided to create a “special force” of optimistic agents—applicants who had barely failed the Career Profile (scoring from 9 to 11) but had scored in the top half of the ASQ. Over a hundred agents who no one else would hire, because they failed the industry test, would be taken on. They would not know they were special agents. If this group failed utterly, Met Life stood to lose about three million dollars in training costs.</p>
<p class="indent">So one thousand of the fifteen thousand applicants were hired into the regular force; half were optimists and half were pessimists. (I said above that as a rule applicants are very optimistic. But of course, half the applicants fall below the average, some of them well below, which is where <a id="page104"/>we found the pessimistic applicants.) And 129 more—all of whom had scored in the top half of the ASQ, and thus were genuine optimists, but had failed the Career Profile—were hired as well. They made up the optimistic special force.</p>
<p class="indent">Over the next two years the new agents were monitored, and this is how they did:</p>
<p class="indent">In the first year, the optimists in the regular force outsold the pessimists, but only by 8 percent. In the second year, the optimists sold 31 percent more.</p>
<p class="indent">As for the special force, it did beautifully. They outsold the pessimists in the regular force by 21 percent during the first year, and by 57 percent in the second year. They even outsold the average of the regular force over the first <em>two</em> years, by 27 percent. In fact, they sold at least as much as the optimists in the regular force.</p>
<p class="indent">We also saw that the optimists kept improving over the pessimists. Why? Our theory had been that optimism matters because it produces persistence. At first, we expected, talent and motivation for selling should be at least as important as persistence. But as time goes on and the mountain of no’s accumulates, persistence should become decisive. This proved to be exactly the pattern.</p>
<p class="indent">The optimism test predicted selling results as least as accurately as the Career Profile did.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c06-s05">The Special Force</h2>
<p class="nonindent">W<span class="small">HO WAS HIRED</span> into the special force? Let me tell you about Robert Dell, and the day my theory took on flesh and blood.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="c06-nts2a"/><em>Success Magazine</em> heard about the special-force study and interviewed me. In 1987 they published an article about optimism and the supersalesman, which began with a profile of a man named Robert Dell, who was supposed to be a typical member of Met Life’s special force. Dell, said the article, had worked in a slaughterhouse and had gotten a pink slip after years on the job. He applied to Met Life and, in spite of failing the Career Profile, had been hired because of his high score on the ASQ. According to the article, he had become a star salesman, because he was not only persistent but imaginative. He found customers in places where no one else even looked.</p>
<p class="indent">I had assumed “Robert Dell” was a fictional character—a composite, typical special-force agent. But one day a few weeks after the article came out, my secretary told me I had a call from a Mr. Robert Dell. I snatched <a id="page105"/>up the receiver. “Robert Dell?” I asked. “Robert Dell? You mean you really exist?”</p>
<p class="indent">“I’m real,” said a deep voice on the other end of the line. “They didn’t make me up.”</p>
<p class="indent">Dell told me that what the magazine had reported was true, and added to the story. He had worked in an eastern Pennsylvania slaughterhouse for twenty-six years, all of his adult life. The work was grueling, but at least he was working in the scrapple kitchen, not quite as bad as some of the other jobs. Then demand went down. The union contract guaranteed him a minimum amount of work time, but he was told he’d have to put in that time on the killing floor. It was disturbing work for him. The company’s business got worse, and one Monday morning he reported to work to find a small sign on the front door. It read <span class="small">CLOSED</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">“I wasn’t about to collect welfare for the rest of my life,” Dell told me, “so I answered a blind ad three or four days later, for people who wanted to sell insurance. I’d never sold anything and didn’t know if I could, but I took your test, and, what do you know, Met Life wanted to hire me.”</p>
<p class="indent">Losing his slaughterhouse job, he said, proved to be a blessing in disguise. In his first year on the special force he earned 50 percent more than he had in the slaughterhouse. In his second year he had doubled his slaughterhouse salary. Furthermore, he loved the work, particularly the freedom to set his own limits and discipline himself.</p>
<p class="indent">“But I had a terrible morning today,” he went on. “I’d written a huge policy. It had taken me months to nurse it along—the biggest policy I’d ever written. And then, a couple of hours ago, Met Life’s underwriting department turned it down. So I decided to call you.”</p>
<p class="indent">“That’s great, Mr. Dell,” I replied, not catching on. “I’m glad you did.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Dr. Seligman, this article told me that you’ve picked out a whole force of winners for Met Life, people who keep going even when bad things happen, like what happened to me this morning. I assume you didn’t do this for free.”</p>
<p class="indent">“That’s true.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Well, I think you should return the favor and buy from me.”</p>
<p class="indent">I did.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c06-s06">Met Life’s New Hiring Policy</h2>
<p class="nonindent">I<span class="small">N THE</span> 1950s Met Life was the giant of the insurance industry, employing over 20,000 agents. Over the next thirty years, Met decided to cut back its sales force and rely on other means to sell insurance and other products. <a id="page106"/>By 1987, when we were just completing the special force study, Met Life had long ago been displaced by Prudential as the industry leader and its sales force had withered to just over eight thousand agents. A new, forceful leadership of the sales force was needed to reverse the slide. John Creedon brought in Bob Crimmins, a silver-haired dynamo with astonishing oratorical charisma. Crimmins in turn recruited Dr. Howard Mase, an enormously successful trainer and developer of managers for CitiCorp, to breathe new life into selection and training. Their ambitious goal was to increase the sales force dramatically—to ten thousand the next year and, if that worked, to twelve thousand the year after—and by so doing to increase Met Life’s market share. But they wanted to keep the quality of the force high at the same time. It looked to them as if our special force study could help, since we had demonstrated on a massive scale that optimism predicts success, above and beyond traditional criteria for hiring.</p>
<p class="indent">So Met Life decided to give the ASQ to all its applicants from then on, and as a major part of their bold strategy started hiring people according to their optimism. They used us well.</p>
<p class="indent">Under Crimmins’s and Mase’s leadership, Met Life adopted a two-pronged strategy for selecting new agents. The company hires applicants who score in the top half of the ASQ and fail the Career Profile by just a little. This makes for a large number of agents who would not even have been considered using the old strategy. In addition, the most pessimistic 25 percent aren’t hired even if they pass the Career Profile. So the predicted problem employees, who used to be such expensive failures for the company, now are not hired. With this strategy, Met Life has exceeded its goal and expanded the sales force to more than twelve thousand. I’m told that by doing so Met has increased its share of the personal-insurance market by almost 50 percent. The company has not only a larger sales force, but a better one. By one measure of production, they have now regained the lead in the industry.</p>
<p class="indent">By using the ASQ, Bob Crimmins and Howard Mase had gone a long way to satisfying Met Life’s manpower needs in less than two years.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c06-s07">Changing Pessimists into Optimists</h2>
<p class="nonindent">I <span class="small">WAS IN</span> John Creedon’s office again. The pile of the carpets was still deep, the oak paneling still glowed, but all of us were somewhat older. When we’d first met seven years before, at my talk to the chief executive officers of life-insurance companies, John had just become CEO of Met <a id="page107"/>Life and I’d had a gleam in my eye about optimism and success. John had risen to national prominence as a leader of the American business community. Now he told me he was retiring in a year.</p>
<p class="indent">We reviewed what we had accomplished. We had found that optimism could be measured and, as we hoped, could predict a person’s success as a life-insurance agent. Not only had we changed the selection strategy of this immense company, but the selection policy of the whole industry was now showing signs of change.</p>
<p class="indent">‘One thing bothers me still,’ John said. “Every business is stuck with some pessimists. Some are entrenched by seniority, others are around because they’re good at what they do. As I’ve gotten older,” he continued, “I find the pessimists weigh on me more and more. They always tell me what I can’t do. They only tell me what’s wrong. I know it’s not their intention, but they curdle action, imagination, and initiative. I believe that most of them—and certainly the company—would be better off if they were more optimistic.</p>
<p class="indent">“So, here’s my question. Can you take a person who’s had thirty or even fifty years of practice at thinking pessimistically and change him into an optimist?”</p>
<p class="indent">The answer to that question is yes. But Creedon was now talking not about sales agents but about his executive corps, particularly the conservative bureaucracy that, whoever the CEO, has so much practical control over any institution. I didn’t know exactly how to go about reforming a bureaucracy. Executives can’t be ordered to take tests and seminars the way agents can. Not even Creedon, perhaps, could require them to undergo cognitive therapy, singly or en masse. But, even if he could, would it be wise to teach them optimism?</p>
<p class="indent">That night, and for many nights after, I thought about John’s request. Is there a proper role for pessimism in a well-run corporation? Is there a proper role for pessimism in a well-run life?</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c06-s08">Why Pessimism?</h2>
<p class="nonindent">P<span class="small">ESSIMISM</span> is all around us. Some people are continually afflicted with it. All but the most optimistic among us have bouts of it. Is pessimism one of nature’s colossal mistakes, or does it have a valuable place in the scheme of things?</p>
<p class="indent">Pessimism may support the realism we so often need. In many arenas of life, optimism is unwarranted. At times we do fail irretrievably, and <a id="page108"/>seeing those times through rose-colored glasses may console us but will not change them. In some situations—the cockpit of an airliner, for example—what’s needed is not an upbeat view but a mercilessly realistic one. Sometimes we need to cut our losses and invest elsewhere rather than find reasons to hold on.</p>
<p class="indent">When Creedon asked me if I could change the pessimism of Metropolitan Life executives, I was less worried about my ability to change pessimism into optimism than I was about the harm I might do. Maybe some of the pessimism his executives brought to their jobs accomplished something important. Someone has to dampen overly enthusiastic plans. These pessimists had risen to the top of America’s corporate ladder—they had to be doing something right.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="c06-nts3a"/>That evening, thinking back over John’s complaint, I once again pondered a question that had long nagged at me: Why has evolution allowed depression and pessimism to exist at all? Certainly optimism seems to have an evolutionary role. In his acute, speculative book <em>Optimism: The Biology of Hope</em> Lionel Tiger argues that the human species has been selected by evolution because of its optimistic illusions about reality. How else could a species have evolved that plants seeds in April and holds on through drought and famine until October, that stands up alone before charging mastodons and waves small sticks, that commences to build cathedrals that will take several lifetimes to complete? The capacity to act on the hope that reality will turn out better than it usually does is behind such courageous, or foolhardy, behavior.</p>
<p class="indent">Or consider this: Many people believe there is no God, that the only purposes in life are those people manage to create for themselves, and that when they die, they rot. If this is so, why are so many of these same people cheerful? The capacity to blind ourselves to our own deeply held negative beliefs may be our remarkable defense against succumbing continually to depression.</p>
<p class="indent">But what, then, is the role of pessimism? Perhaps it corrects for something we do only poorly when we are optimistic and not depressed—namely, appreciating reality accurately.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s a disturbing idea, that depressed people see reality correctly while nondepressed people distort reality in a self-serving way. As a therapist I was trained to believe that it was my job to help depressed patients both to feel happier and to see the world more clearly. I was supposed to be the agent of happiness <em>and</em> of truth. But maybe truth and happiness antagonize each other. Perhaps what we have considered good therapy for a depressed patient merely nurtures benign illusions, making the patient think his world is better than it actually is.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page109"/>There is considerable evidence that depressed people, though sadder, are wiser.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="c06-nts4a"/>Ten years ago Lauren Alloy and Lyn Abramson, then graduate students at the University of Pennsylvania, did an experiment in which people were given differing degrees of control over the lighting of a light. Some were able to control the light perfectly: It went on every time they pressed a button, and it never went on if they didn’t press. The other people, however, had no control at all: The light went on regardless of whether they pressed the button.</p>
<p class="indent">The people in both groups were asked to judge, as accurately as they could, how much control they had. Depressed people were very accurate, both when they had control and when they didn’t. The nondepressed people shocked us. They were accurate when they had control, but when helpless they were undeterred: they still judged that they had a great deal of control.</p>
<p class="indent">Wondering if lights and button pushing just didn’t matter enough to the people, Alloy and Abramson added monetary incentives to the test: When the light went on the subjects won money, but when the light didn’t go on they lost money. But the benign distortions of nondepressed people did not go away; rather, they got even bigger. Under one condition all the people had some control, but the task was rigged so that everyone lost money. In this situation, nondepressed people said they had less control than they actually had. When the task was rigged so that they won money, nondepressed people said they had more control than they actually had. Depressed people, on the other hand, were rock solid, exactly accurate whether they won or lost.</p>
<p class="indent">These have been the consistent findings over the last decade. Depressed people—most of whom turn out to be pessimists—accurately judge how much control they have. Nondepressed people—optimists, for the most part—believe they have much more control over things than they actually do, particularly when they are helpless and have no control at all.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="c06-nts5a"/>Another kind of evidence for the thesis that depressed people, though sadder, are wiser involves judgments of skill. Several years ago, <em>Newsweek</em> reported that 80 percent of American men think they are in the top half of social skills. They must have been nondepressed American men, if the results of Peter Lewinsohn, a psychologist at the University of Oregon, and his colleagues are valid. These investigators put depressed and nondepressed patients in a panel discussion and later had the patients judge how well they did. To what extent were they persuasive? Likable? As judged by a panel of observers, depressed patients weren’t very persuasive or likable; poor social skills are a symptom of depression. Depressed patients judged their lack of skill accurately. The surprising finding was from <a id="page110"/>the nondepressed group. They markedly overestimated their skills, judging themselves as much more persuasive and appealing than the judges thought they were.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="c06-nts6a"/>Still another variety of evidence concerns memory. In general, depressed subjects recall more bad events and fewer good events than nondepressed subjects, who show the reverse pattern. But who is right? That is, if the real number of good and bad events in the world could be known, who would see the past accurately and who would distort the past?</p>
<p class="indent">When I first became a therapist, I was taught that it was useless to ask depressed patients about their past, if you wanted to get an accurate picture of their lives. All you would ever hear was how their parents didn’t love them, how their business ventures always failed, and how dreadful their hometown was. But could it be they were right? This could easily be tested in the laboratory by having people take a test, managed so that they are wrong twenty times and right twenty times. Later you ask them how they did. The evidence seems to be that depressives are accurate: they tell you, for example, that they got twenty-one right and nineteen wrong. It is the nondepressed people who distort the past: They may tell you they got twelve wrong and twenty-eight right.</p>
<p class="indent">A final category of evidence in the matter of whether depressed people are sadder but wiser involves explanatory style. Judging by the explanations of nondepressed people, failure is indeed an orphan, as the saying goes, and success has a thousand fathers. Depressives, however, own up to both failure and success.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="c06-nts7a"/>This pattern has consistently emerged in all of our studies of explanatory style: lopsidedness among nondepressives and evenhandedness among depressives. The questionnaire you took in chapter three had half bad events and half good events, to which you assigned causes. You computed an overall G–B score, which was your average for good events minus your average for bad events. How did your total compare to that of depressives? A depressive’s explanatory style is roughly the same for good and bad events; that is, to the extent a depressive is a bit above average on personal, permanent, and pervasive explanations for good events, he is also a bit above average on personal, permanent, and pervasive explanations for bad events. A depressive’s total G–B score is around 0; he is evenhanded.</p>
<p class="indent">A nondepressive’s score is well above 0, very lopsided. If it’s bad, you did it to me, it’ll be over soon, and it’s only this situation. But if it’s good, I did it, it’s going to last forever, and it’s going to help me in many situations. For nondepressives, bad events tend to be external, temporary, and specific, but good events are personal, permanent and pervasive. The more optimistic their judgments are, the more lopsided. A depressed person, in <a id="page111"/>contrast, sees his successes as caused by the same sorts of factors as his failures.</p>
<p class="indent">Overall, then, there is clear evidence that nondepressed people distort reality in a self-serving direction and depressed people tend to see reality accurately. How does this evidence, which is about depression, tie into optimism and pessimism? Statistically, most depressed people score in the pessimistic range of explanatory style, and most nondepressed people score optimistically. This means that, on average, optimistic people will distort reality and pessimists, as Ambrose Bierce defined them, will <a id="c06-nts8a"/>“see the world aright.” The pessimist seems to be at the mercy of reality, whereas the optimist has a massive defense against reality that maintains good cheer in the face of a relentlessly indifferent universe. It is important to remember, however, that this relationship is statistical, and that pessimists do not have a lock on reality. Some realists, the minority, are optimists, and some distorters, also the minority, are pessimists.</p>
<p class="indent">Is depressive accuracy just a laboratory curiosity? I don’t think so. Rather it leads us to the very heart of what pessimism is really about. It is our first solid clue about why we have depression at all, the closest we’ve come to an answer to the question asked earlier: why evolution has allowed pessimism and depression to survive and prosper. If pessimism is at the base of depression and suicide, if it results in lower achievement, and as we will see, in poor immune function and in ill health, why didn’t it die out epochs ago? What counterweighting function does pessimism serve for the human species?</p>
<p class="indent">The benefits of pessimism may have arisen during our recent evolutionary history. We are animals of the Pleistocene, the epoch of the ice ages. Our emotional makeup has most recently been shaped by one hundred thousand years of climactic catastrophe: waves of cold and heat; drought and flood; plenty and sudden famine. Those of our ancestors who survived the Pleistocene may have done so because they had the capacity to worry incessantly about the future, to see sunny days as mere prelude to a harsh winter, to brood. We have inherited these ancestors’ brains and therefore their capacity to see the cloud rather than the silver lining.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes and in some niches in modern life, this deep-seated pessimism works. Think about a successful large business. It has a diverse set of personalities serving different roles. First, there are the optimists. The researchers and developers, the planners, the marketers—all these need to be visionaries. They have to dream things that don’t yet exist, to explore boundaries beyond the company’s present reach. If they don’t, the competition will. But imagine a company that consisted only of optimists, all of them fixed upon the exciting possibilities ahead. It would be a disaster.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page112"/>The company also needs its pessimists, the people who have an accurate knowledge of present realities. They must make sure grim reality continually intrudes upon the optimists. The treasurer, the CPAs, the financial vice-president, the business administrators, the safety engineers—all these need an accurate sense of how much the company can afford, and of danger. Their role is to caution, their banner is the yellow flag.</p>
<p class="indent">One should hasten to say that these people may not be the full-blown, high-octane pessimists whose explanatory style continually undermines their achievement and health. Some among them may be depressives, but others, perhaps even the majority, may for all their somber caution at their desks otherwise be cheery and sanguine. Some are merely prudent and measured people, who have nurtured their pessimistic side in the service of their careers. John Creedon was never suggesting that his executive corps was full of severe pessimists incapacitated by helplessness. But the difference is only in degree. These executives would, as a group, test out as pessimists, and their outlook would be basically, though not drastically, pessimistic.</p>
<p class="indent">These mild pessimists—call them professional pessimists—seem to make good use of pessimistic accuracy (it’s their stock-in-trade) without suffering unbearably from the costs of pessimism: the bouts of depression and the lack of initiative we have seen so far in this book, and the ill health and failure to attain high office that we will see in the later chapters.</p>
<p class="indent">So the successful corporation has its optimists, dreamers, salesmen, and creators. But the corporation is a form of modern life that also needs its pessimists, the realists whose job is to counsel caution. I want to underline, however, the fact that at the head of the corporation must be a CEO, sage enough and flexible enough to balance the optimistic vision of the planners against the jeremiads of the CPAs. Creedon was just such a CEO, and his complaint to me about his corporate pessimists came from his daily task of reconciling the polarities.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c06-s09">The Balance Sheet: Optimism vs. Pessimism</h2>
<p class="nonindent">P<span class="small">ERHAPS</span> a successful life, like a successful company, needs both optimism and at least occasional pessimism, and for the same reason a corporation does. Perhaps a successful life also needs a CEO who has <em>flexible optimism</em> at his command.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page113"/>I have just made the case for pessimism. It heightens our sense of reality and endows us with accuracy, particularly if we live in a world filled with unexpected and frequent disasters. Let me now review the case against pessimism (the other side of the case for optimism) so that we can compare its costs to its benefits.</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>Pessimism promotes depression.</li>
<li>Pessimism produces inertia rather than activity in the face of setbacks.</li>
<li>Pessimism feels bad subjectively—blue, down, worried, anxious.</li>
<li>Pessimism is self-fulfilling. Pessimists don’t persist in the face of challenges, and therefore fail more frequently—even when success is attainable.</li>
<li>Pessimism is associated with poor physical health (see chapter ten).</li>
<li>Pessimists are defeated when they try for high office (see chapter eleven).</li>
<li>Even when pessimists are right and things turn out badly, they still feel worse. Their explanatory style now converts the predicted setback into a disaster, a disaster into a catastrophe.</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">The best thing one can say about a pessimist is that his fears were founded.</p>
<p class="indent">The balance sheet seems to come out heavily on the side of optimism, but there are times and places where we need our pessimism. Chapter twelve presents guidelines on who should not use optimism and in what circumstances pessimism is best deployed.</p>
<p class="indent">All of us—extreme pessimists and extreme optimists alike—experience both states. Explanatory style probably has built-in flux. Circadian cycles ensure occasional mild depression. Depression has a rhythm through the day and, at least among some women, through the month. Typically we are more depressed when we wake up, and as the day goes on we become more optimistic. But superimposed on this is our BRAC, our Basic Rest and Activity Cycle. As noted previously, it hits its lows at roughly four in the afternoon and again at four in the morning. Its highs occur in late morning and early evening, although the exact timing varies from person to person.</p>
<p class="indent">During the highs, we are more optimistic than usual. We formulate adventurous plans: our next romantic conquest, the new sports car. During the lows, we are more inclined to depression and pessimism than usual. We see the stark realities that our plans entail: She’d never be interested in someone who is divorced and has three kids. A new Jaguar costs more <a id="page114"/>than I make in a year. If you are an optimist and want to see this graphically, just remember the last time you woke up at four in the morning and couldn’t get back to sleep. Worries that you easily dismiss during the day now overwhelm you: The argument with your spouse means divorce, the frown from the boss means you’ll be fired.</p>
<p class="indent">During these daily bouts of pessimism we can see its constructive role in our lives. In these mild forms, pessimism serves the purpose of pulling us back a bit from the risky exaggerations of our optimism, making us think twice, keeping us from making rash, foolhardy gestures. The optimistic moments of our lives contain the great plans, the dreams, and the hopes. Reality is benignly distorted to give the dreams room to flourish. Without these times we would never accomplish anything difficult and intimidating, we would never even attempt the just barely possible. Mount Everest would remain unscaled, the four-minute mile unrun; the jet plane and the computer would be blueprints sitting in some financial vice-president’s wastebasket.</p>
<p class="indent">The genius of evolution lies in the dynamic tension between optimism and pessimism continually correcting each other. As we rise and fall daily with the circadian cycle, that tension permits us both to venture and to retrench—without danger, for as we move toward an extreme, the tension pulls us back. In a sense it is this perpetual fluctuation that permits human beings to accomplish so much.</p>
<p class="indent">Evolution, however, has also given us our ancestors’ Pleistocene brain. Through it come the naggings of pessimism: Success is fleeting; danger lurks around the next corner; tragedy awaits us; optimism is hubris. But the brain that accurately mirrored the grim realities of the ice ages now lags behind the less grim realities of modern life. Agriculture, and then the leap of industrial technology, put human beings in developed countries much less at the mercy of the next harsh winter. No longer do two out of three of our children die before they reach their fifth birthday. No longer is it reasonable for a woman to expect her own death during childbirth. No longer does massive starvation follow prolonged cold or drought. Certainly modern life has its own abundant menaces and tragedies: crime, AIDS, divorce, the threat of nuclear war, the undermining of the ecosystem. But it is only the most willfully negative manipulation of the statistics that has modern life in the West even approach the level of disaster that shaped the ice-age brain. And so we do well to recognize the insistent voice of pessimism for the vestige it is.</p>
<p class="indent">It does not follow that we should become lotus-eaters. It does follow that we are entitled to more optimism than we may naturally feel. Do we have a choice about using optimism? Can we learn the skills of optimism, <a id="page115"/>superimpose them on the Pleistocene brain to enjoy their benefits, but still retain pessimism when we need it?</p>
<p class="indent">I believe we can, for evolution has allowed one thing more. Like the successful company, we each have in us an executive who balances the counsels of daring against the counsels of doom. When optimism prompts us to chance it and pessimism bids us to cower, a part of us heeds both. This executive is sapience. It is this entity to whom is addressed the most basic point of this book: By understanding the single virtue of pessimism along with its pervasive, crippling consequences, we can learn to resist pessimism’s constant callings, as deep-seated in brain or in habit as they may be. We can learn to choose optimism for the most part, but also to heed pessimism when it is warranted.</p>
<p class="indent">How to learn the skills of optimism and the guidelines for deploying such flexible optimism are the topics of “Changing: From Pessimism to Optimism,” the concluding section of this book.</p>
