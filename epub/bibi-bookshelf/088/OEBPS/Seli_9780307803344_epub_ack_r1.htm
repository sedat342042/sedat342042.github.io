<h1 class="chapter" id="ack"><a id="page304"/><a id="page305"/><em>Acknowledgments</em></h1>
<p class="nonindent">There are four people without whose help this book would not have come into being.</p>
<p class="indent">First and foremost is Tom Congdon. When I finally decided I would write a book that tried to explain the field of personal control to the layman, I knew I needed help. I am vain enough to think my technical writing is pretty good, but writing dialogue, sustaining suspense, characterizing the scientists I’ve known were all tasks beyond anything I had done before. I met Tom and was able to convince him to work with me. Tom not only rewrote most sentences in the book, but he helped reorganize it. He challenged notions that had eluded the professionals in the field and made me rethink them. But best of all, when spirits flagged, when editors carped, when hard discs crashed, when ideas ran dry, Tom was always there to encourage and support and nurture. And he became a friend.</p>
<p class="indent">Dan Oran, the president of Foresight, Inc., urged me to write this book. I balked. Too much else to do: too many experiments on personal control yet undone, too many manuals for preventing depression, low achievement of infectious illness to work on, too many other walks of life in which to test optimism. He made the case more palatable by offering to write it with me. But as he made me take the project more and more seriously, I realized that it was the story of my life’s work and since I was responsible for that, I wanted to be the sole author.</p>
<p class="indent">Dan also introduced me to Richard Pine, who became my agent. Agents, I read recently in <em>The New York Times</em>, are supposed to be the people “who never return your calls.” Not Richard. He is an author’s dream. He has read every word of this book at least four times. Not a few words, he urged changing. At the end of our first meeting, sensing my balkiness, Richard said, “I pray for this book. This is the sort of stuff religions are made of.”</p>
<p class="indent">I was taken aback and repeated this extraordinary statement to my new father-in-law, a reserved British industrialist, Dennis McCarthy, the next week. “I don’t know about that,” he said, “but think about large companies. A successful company has both a research and a development department. You’ve spent the last twenty-five <a id="page306"/>years doing basic research on personal control and in recent times you’ve begun your development phase. This book, giving away the basic ideas to the layman who wants to know how to lead a more rational life, is development of a high order.” In that moment I decided to do the book. For the next year and a half it was pretty much all I did. Dennis also gave me invaluable suggestions about the business chapters.</p>
<p class="indent">A number of other people had very useful advice about the manuscript as a whole or about large swaths of it.</p>
<p class="indent">First my editor, Jonathan Segal. Jonathan’s tough-minded readings of the manuscript were not only for style (“Always write up”), but about major issues of substance as well (“Emphasize flexible optimism. You no more want people to be prisoners of optimism than prisoners of pessimism. What is pessimism good for? Under what conditions should people deploy pessimism rather than optimism?” And many more). The book is meatier because of Jonathan’s help.</p>
<p class="indent">Next, Karen Reivich. Karen writes dialogue beautifully, and I asked her to generate lots of it from her experience running and designing seminars for Foresight, Inc., in changing explanatory style. Many of the dialogues between therapist and patient, mother and child, originate in Karen’s experience or in her fertile imagination. She also argued with me about the title (and subtitle) at length and helped select the poetry. I hope Karen becomes a psychologist. Tom Congdon wants her to become a writer. Both of us hold her and her talents in high esteem.</p>
<p class="indent">Peter Schulman has worked with me for the last eight years as the administrator of my scientific research and the vice-president for operations of Foresight, Inc. At many points in writing this book, I went to Peter and asked him to analyze still more data. “By how much in grade-point average did the West Point optimists beat the West Point pessimists?” “Does Prudential’s special force do as well as Met Life’s special force?” And many more. Peter’s answers were always prompt, careful, and not infrequently brilliant.</p>
<p class="indent">My daughter, Amanda Seligman, presently a senior classics major at Princeton, read the first third of the manuscript in early draft and helped me bring it down to earth.</p>
<p class="indent">Terry Silver, my secretary, helped in ways too numerous to list.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally the twenty undergraduate and eight graduate students who took my seminar in 1989–90 at the University of Pennsylvania read the whole first draft. Many commented usefully.</p>
<p class="extract">A large number of other people helped with individual chapters. I am grateful to all of the following people, most of whom have allowed me to collaborate with them or whose work has directly inspired my own:</p>
<p class="indent">Chapter one. To get started I asked the help of several skilled writers. Ralph Keyes, Carol Stillman, and Bob Trotter all read the very first draft and each tried to point me in the right direction.</p>
<p class="indent">Chapter two narrates the history of learned helplessness. Though their contributions are chronicled there, Steve Maier, Bruce Overmier, Dick Solomon, and Don Hiroto must be singled out as the major forces who helped create and guide this field. The National Institute of Mental Health, the National Science Foundation, the Guggenheim Foundation, and the Woodrow Wilson Foundation all supported my work during this period.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page307"/>Chapter three discusses explanatory style. This concept had its beginning with Lyn Abramson, Chris Peterson, John Teasdale, and Judy Garber. Their story is told in this chapter. Karen Reivich helped create and validate the questionnaire in this chapter. The National Institute of Mental Health (especially Jack Maser and Bob Hirschfeld), which has supported my work for over twenty years, and the National Science Foundation deserve special thanks. The Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences also supported me during this period.</p>
<p class="indent">Chapters four and five are about depression. Aaron Beck and Albert Ellis must be singled out for demystifying depression and bringing it from the darkness into the penumbra. Along with Dean Schuyler and Mickey Stunkard, Beck was the mentor who showed me how depression could be cured. Gerry Klerman, Myrna Weissman, Janice Egeland, and Buck Schieffelin have all made fundamental contributions to the understanding of depression as it is found across the world. Lenore Radloff developed the CES-D. Steve Hollon, Rob DeRubeis, and Mark Evans carried out the definitive study of cognitive therapy for depression and I am grateful to them for their collaboration. Susan Nolen-Hoeksema devised and tested the theory of rumination and gender differences in depression. The National Institute of Mental Health supports my work in this area, and it must be said that without this institution’s support of the hundreds of scientists in the field of affective disorders, depression would still be a mystery with no cure. Humanity should be grateful to this great American institution.</p>
<p class="indent">Chapter six is about success at work, and Metropolitan Life has been the inspiration for it. Met Life is also the organization in which many of the ideas were tested and validated. I am particularly grateful to Dick Calogero, who was my patient collaborator for seven years, to John Creedon, who got everything started, to Howard Mase and Bob Crimmins, who led the charge, to AI Oberlander, Joyce Jiggetts, Yvonne Miesse and the nearly 200,000 applicants and agents who have taken the Attributional Style Questionnaire. I would like to acknowledge the significant contribution of Dr. Mary Anne Layden to the authorship of this questionnaire. Numerous meetings with Amy Semmel, Lyn Abramson, Lauren Alloy, and Nadine Kaslow then refined it.</p>
<p class="indent">John Riley introduced me to the leaders of the insurance industry, and Dan Oran and Peter Schulman of Foresight, Inc., ran the studies and analyzed the findings. Robert Dell exemplifies what it is to be a fine “special agent,” and I am grateful to him for letting me tell his intimate story. I also thank the many applicants and agents of Mutual of Omaha, Prudential, and Reliance who have taken the ASQ.</p>
<p class="indent">Dennis McCarthy provided insights into optimism and industry. Lauren Alloy and Lyn Abramson are the psychologists who have most shaped the field of depressive realism.</p>
<p class="indent">Chapters seven and eight are about parents and children. Nadine Kaslow and Richard Tanenbaum led the way in creating the CASQ. Carol Dweck’s research on schoolchildren and helplessness opened up the field of achievement and explanatory style. Chris Peterson devised the CAVE technique and Glen Elder inspired its first use with historical data. The Social Science Research Council Committee on Life Span Development, led by Matilda Riley, Bert Brim, Paul <a id="page308"/>Baltes, Dave Featherman, and Judy Dunn, nurtured and inspired our longitudinal studies of children. The National Institute of Mental Health funded it.</p>
<p class="indent">Joan Girgus and Susan Nolen-Hoeksema have been the central contributors to the field of explanatory style and depression in children. Both read and made major changes in chapter eight. The school systems of Princeton, Trenton, and East Windsor townships in New Jersey have patiently allowed us to test their wards for the last five years. We are very grateful to the teachers, parents, and administrators, and mostly to the kids, from these schools. Cindy Fruchtman and Gilda Paul ran these studies. Willis Stetson and the admissions officials at the University of Pennsylvania, and Dick Butler, Bob Priest, and William Burke at West Point were generous collaborators. My son, David Seligman, helped me give the test at West Point.</p>
<p class="indent">Several of my graduate students gave me good advice about the naïveté of advising warring couples not to fight. Lisa Jaycox, Deborah Stearns, Jane Eisner, Greg Buchanan, Nicholas Maxwell, Karen Reivich, and Jane Gillham all read this chapter carefully and changed my thinking about how to present the issue.</p>
<p class="indent">Chapter nine is about sports. Chris Peterson did the first work on explanatory style and sports. David Rettew, Karen Reivich, and David Seligman worked long and hard on these studies. David Rettew originated the National League study. The Elias Sports Bureau’s compilations of baseball statistics are a marvel. Susan Nolen-Hoeksema carried out the studies of the Berkeley swimmers; special thanks must go to Nort and Karen Moe Thornton, the Berkeley swimming coaches, and most of all to the men and women of the Berkeley varsity swim teams.</p>
<p class="indent">Chapter ten is about health. Madelon Visintainer, Joe Volpicelli, Steve Maier, Leslie Kamen, and Judy Rodin did the seminal work in learned helplessness, explanatory style, and health. Chris Peterson and George Vaillant led the study of explanatory style and health over the life span. Judy Rodin and Sandy Levy are the leaders and inspiration of the MacArthur studies of health, the immune system, and personality. T George Harris kept reminding me how important this work was and let the world know about it. The MacArthur Foundation, generous and adventurous souls, and the National Institute on Aging have funded this work.</p>
<p class="indent">Chapter eleven is about politics, culture, and religion. Harold Zullow spearheaded the work on American politics. I cheered him on. Gabriele Oettingen, likewise, spearheaded the work on explanatory style across cultures. I cheered her on. Eva Morawska and Gabriele carried out the studies of Judaism and Russian Orthodoxy. Dan Goleman suggested predicting the 1988 primaries and Alan Kors, almost twenty years ago, insisted that a rigorous and predictive psychohistory was possible. (It was also Alan who, when my book <em>Helplessness</em> came out fifteen years ago, remarked that he hoped that my next one would be about the opposite. It is.) Jack Rachman took me to the betting shops of Edinburgh. Poor man, he too bet on Dukakis.</p>
<p class="indent">Chapters twelve, thirteen, and fourteen are about how to change explanatory style. Art Freeman and Steve Hollon led the work which transformed Beck’s principles of cognitive therapy with depressed people to workshops and exercises which nondepressed people could usefully carry out—and carry out preventively. Dan Oran and Karen Reivich administered these projects and also made major intellectual contributions to the content. Tim Beck and Albert Ellis founded this whole field and many of their ideas and schemae are incorporated.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page309"/>Ed Craighead and Robert DeMonbreun wrote the first prevention program for children almost fifteen years ago, when its time had not yet come. Susan Nolen-Hoeksema and Judy Garber have also played a major role in the understanding of how to prevent depression in kids, and made useful suggestions for chapter thirteen.</p>
<p class="indent">Metropolitan Life in general, and Dick Calogero, Howard Mase, Bob Crimmins, Yvonne Miesse, Joyce Jiggetts, and John Creedon in particular played important roles in our studies of how to change explanatory style in industry. I am especially grateful to the agents of Metropolitan Life who have taken Foresight, Inc.’s seminars.</p>
<p class="indent">Chapter fifteen is about the future and I am grateful to Lara Catrina Seligman just for being part of it. T George Harris twisted my arm to write about depression and individualism, and the American Psychological Association’s invitation to deliver the 1988 G. Stanley Hall Lecture provided the first occasion for these thoughts. Knopf’s anonymous proofreader should be singled out for praise. She made a special trip to the Cloister’s collection to check out the accuracy of the remark about Renaissance painting. Proofreading at its best. Barry Schwartz, my bridge partner and source of intellectual stimulation for over twenty years, has been a major force in getting me to rethink the questions of selfishness and individualism and the weak no trump.</p>
<p class="extract">Finally there have been two global influences on my life and this book. The psychology department at the University of Pennsylvania has been the home and support of all this work for twenty-five years. I owe a debt of gratitude I can never repay to my teachers, my students, and my colleagues there.</p>
<p class="extract">Most of all, I wish to thank Mandy McCarthy, Lara’s mother, my wife. Her love, her intellectual insight, and her unflagging support allowed this book to happen.</p>
