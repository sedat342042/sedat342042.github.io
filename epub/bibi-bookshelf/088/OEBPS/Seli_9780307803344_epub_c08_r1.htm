<h1 class="chapter" id="c08"><a id="page136"/>8<br/><em>School</em></h1>
<p class="nonindent">O<span class="small">NE COLD AND</span> windy day in April 1970, when I was still a fairly new professor at the University of Pennsylvania, I found myself waiting in line to check into Haddon Hall, a slightly decaying, once grand hotel that was awaiting the transformation of Atlantic City into the Las Vegas of the East. The occasion was yet another annual convention of the Eastern Psychological Association. Ahead of me was a woman who did not look familiar from behind; but when she turned her head I gaped in astonishment. We’d been friends all during childhood.</p>
<p class="indent">“Joan Stern,” I exclaimed, “is that you?”</p>
<p class="indent">“Marty Seligman! What are you doing here?”</p>
<p class="indent">“I’m a psychologist,” I said.</p>
<p class="indent">“So am I!”</p>
<p class="indent">We both burst into laughter. Of course—what other order of being <em>would</em> we be, checking into this particular convention hotel on this particular weekend. Joan had gotten a doctorate in psychology from the New School for Social Research and I from Penn, and here we were, both of us professors.</p>
<p class="indent">We had gone to kindergarten together (“Do you remember Miss Manville?”) and had grown up three blocks apart (“Is Stittig’s still there?”). When I was sent off to upper-crust Albany Academy, she had gone off to Saint Agnes, the girls’ equivalent. Life had gotten much better for both of us the first day we left Albany and entered college. We discovered that the world contained more than a few people like us, and that Debbie Reynolds’s looks and Elvis Presley’s music were not universally loved, nor the life of the mind universally scorned. Joan was married now; her married name was Joan Girgus.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page137"/>I asked her what she was working on.</p>
<p class="indent">“Kids,” she said, “what they perceive and think, and how this changes as they grow up.” She told me about her fascinating work on visual illusions. I told her about learned helplessness.</p>
<p class="indent">“Is your father still alive?” she asked. “How difficult that must have been for you,” she said when I told her about his death. She understood that kind of loss very well, because her mother had died when Joan was a teenager.</p>
<p class="indent">As the meeting continued, we spent more and more time together, trying to connect our common past to what was happening now. By the time we parted, it had occurred to both of us that someday our research interests—hers in childhood and mine in personal control—might merge.</p>
<p class="indent">Joan went on to become Dean of Social Sciences at City College in New York and then Dean of the College at Princeton University, and I went on to work on explanatory style. Another decade was to pass before our interests combined. When they did, they coalesced around the question of optimism in the classroom.</p>
<p class="extract">H<span class="small">OW DOES</span> a child’s explanatory style affect his performance in the classroom?</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s begin by going back to the basic theory. When we fail at something, we all become helpless and depressed <em>at least momentarily</em>. We don’t initiate voluntary actions as quickly as we would otherwise, or we may not try at all. If we do try, we will not persist. As you’ve read, explanatory style is the great modulator of learned helplessness. Optimists recover from their momentary helplessness immediately. Very soon after failing, they pick themselves up, shrug, and start trying again. For them, defeat is a challenge, a mere setback on the road to inevitable victory. They see defeat as temporary and specific, not pervasive.</p>
<p class="indent">Pessimists wallow in defeat, which they see as permanent and pervasive. They become depressed and stay helpless for very long periods. A setback is a defeat. And a defeat in one battle is the loss of the war. They don’t begin to try again for weeks or months, and if they try, the slightest new setback throws them back into a helpless state.</p>
<p class="indent">The theory clearly predicts that in the classroom and, as we shall see in the next chapter, the playing field, success will not necessarily go to the most talented. The prize will go to the adequately talented who are also optimists.</p>
<p class="indent">Are these predictions true?</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c08-s01"><a id="page138"/>The Classroom</h2>
<p class="nonindent">I <span class="small">RECENTLY</span> came across the case of a boy I’ll call Alan. At age nine he was what some psychologists would call an omega child—somewhat shy, poorly coordinated, always chosen last in games. He was, however, exceedingly bright and a gifted young artist. His drawings were the best his art teacher had ever seen by a child in elementary school. In Alan’s tenth year his parents separated, and he went into a depression. His grades plummeted, he seldom spoke, and he lost all his interest in drawing.</p>
<p class="indent">His art teacher refused to give up on him. He got the boy to talk and discovered that Alan thought himself stupid, a failure, a sissy … and somehow to blame for his parents’ separation. Patiently the art teacher made Alan see how wrong each of those self-assessments was and led Alan to other, more realistic judgments of himself. Alan came to accept that, far from stupid, he was an outstanding success. He now knew that coordination came late to some boys, and the fact that sports weren’t easy for him made his pluck all the more admirable. The teacher knew Alan’s parents and was able to show him that he had no role whatsoever in their separation.</p>
<p class="indent">In effect, he helped Alan change his explanatory style. Within a few months Alan was winning awards in school and beginning to make some progress in sports as well, with spirit and enthusiasm substituting for skill. No longer an omega child, Alan was on the road to becoming an alpha teenager.</p>
<p class="indent">When your child is doing poorly at school, it is all too easy for his teachers or even for you to conclude falsely that he is untalented or even stupid. Your child may be depressed, and his depression may be preventing him from trying, from persisting, from taking risks which would let him fulfill his potential. Worse, if you conclude that stupidity or lack of talent is the cause, your child will realize this and incorporate it into his theory of himself. His explanatory style will get even worse, and his poor academic performance will become habitual.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c08-s01-s01"><em>Rate Your Child’s Depression</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent"><a id="c08-nts1a"/>How can you tell if your child is depressed?</p>
<p class="indent">Short of a diagnostic interview with a psychologist or psychiatrist, there <a id="page139"/>is no conclusive way to tell. But you can get an approximate answer by asking your child to take the following test. This test, a modification of the depression test you took in chapter four, was devised by Myrna Weissman, Helen Orvaschell, and N. Padian working through the Center for Epidemiological Studies of the National Institute of Mental Health. It is called the CES–DC (Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Child) test. Here’s how to introduce it to your child:</p>
<div class="block">
<p class="bl_nonindent">“I’ve been reading a book about how kids feel, and I’ve been wondering how you feel lately. Sometimes it’s hard for kids to find the words to describe how they feel. Here’s something that gives you different ways to say how you feel. You’ll see that there are four choices for each sentence. I’d like you to read each sentence and pick out the choice that describes best how you have been feeling or acting <em>for the past week</em>. After you make a choice, go on to the next group. There are no right answers or wrong answers.”</p>
</div>
<h4 class="section" id="c08-s01-s01-s01"><em>During the past week</em></h4>
<ol class="arabic">
<li>I was bothered by things that don’t usually bother me.<br/>      <em>Not at all_____A little_____Some_____A lot</em>_____</li>
<li>I did not feel like eating; I wasn’t very hungry.<br/>      <em>Not at all_____A little_____Some_____A lot</em>_____</li>
<li>I wasn’t able to feel happy, even when my family or friends tried to help me feel better.<br/>      <em>Not at all_____A little_____Some_____A lot</em>_____</li>
<li>I felt that I was not as good as other kids.<br/>      <em>Not at all_____A little_____Some_____A lot</em>_____</li>
<li>I felt like I couldn’t pay attention to what I was doing.<br/>      <em>Not at all_____A little_____Some_____A lot</em>_____</li>
<li>I felt down.<br/>      <em>Not at all_____A little_____Some_____A lot</em>_____</li>
<li>I felt like I was too tired to do things.<br/>      <em>Not at all_____A little_____Some_____A lot</em>_____</li>
<li>I felt like something bad was going to happen.<br/>      <em>Not at all_____A little_____Some_____A lot</em>_____</li>
<li><a id="page140"/>I felt like things I did before didn’t work out.<br/>      <em>Not at all_____A little_____Some_____A lot</em>_____</li>
<li>I felt scared.<br/>      <em>Not at all_____A little_____Some_____A lot</em>_____</li>
<li>I didn’t sleep as well as I usually sleep.<br/>      <em>Not at all_____A little_____Some_____A lot</em>_____</li>
<li>I was unhappy.<br/>      <em>Not at all_____A little_____Some_____A lot</em>_____</li>
<li>I was more quiet than usual.<br/>      <em>Not at all_____A little_____Some_____A lot</em>_____</li>
<li>I felt lonely, like I didn’t have any friends.<br/>      <em>Not at all_____A little_____Some_____A lot</em>_____</li>
<li>I felt like kids I know were not friendly or that they didn’t want to be with me.<br/>      <em>Not at all_____A little_____Some_____A lot</em>_____</li>
<li>I didn’t have a good time.<br/>      <em>Not at all_____A little_____Some_____A lot</em>_____</li>
<li>I felt like crying.<br/>      <em>Not at all_____A little_____Some_____A lot</em>_____</li>
<li>I felt sad.<br/>      <em>Not at all_____A little_____Some_____A lot</em>_____</li>
<li>I felt people didn’t like me.<br/>      <em>Not at all_____A little_____Some_____A lot</em>_____</li>
<li>It was hard to get started doing things.<br/>      <em>Not at all_____A little_____Some_____A lot</em>_____</li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">Scoring the test is simple. Each “Not at all” counts as 0, each “A little” counts 1, each “Some” counts 2, and each “A lot” counts 3. To score the test, total these numbers. If your child checked two boxes for one question, give him the higher of the two scores.</p>
<p class="indent">Here’s what the scores mean: If your child scored from 0 to 9, he is probably not depressed. If he scored 10 to 15, he is probably mildly depressed. If he scored over 15 he is showing significant levels of depression; 16 to 24 puts him in the moderately depressed range; and, if he scored <a id="page141"/>over 24, he may well be severely depressed. An important caveat is in order, however: No pen-and-paper test is the equivalent of a professional diagnosis. There are two mistakes a test like this can make, and you should watch out for them: First, many children hide their symptoms, particularly from their parents. So some children who score below 10 may actually be depressed. Second, some children with high scores may have problems other than depression, which are producing the high scores.</p>
<p class="indent">If your child scored 10 or more and is doing badly in school, depression may be causing the poor school work and not vice versa. We have found that among children in the fourth grade, the higher the depression rating the worse the child does at solving anagrams and on IQ-test items, and the worse his grades. This is true even of children who are very talented and very intelligent.</p>
<p class="indent">So, if your child scores over 15 across a two-week span, you should arrange for professional help. If your child scores above 9 and also talks about committing suicide, you should arrange for professional help. A “cognitive-behavioral” child therapist would be ideal. Look in the Yellow Pages under “Psychologists,” “Psychiatrists” or “Psychotherapists.” If you can’t find one who specializes in cognitive or behavioral therapy for children, write a note to me at the University of Pennsylvania or to DART (Depression Awareness, Recognition, Treatment Program) at the National Institute of Mental Health, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Maryland 20857. Between us we will let you know an appropriate therapist close to where you live.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c08-s02">The Princeton-Penn Longitudinal Study</h2>
<p class="nonindent">C<span class="small">OULD A</span> pessimistic explanatory style be one root cause of depression and poor achievement among children, as it is among adults? In 1981, when this question emerged from my investigations, I thought of Joan Girgus. Over the years we had stayed in touch and kept abreast of each other’s research. Her work with children focused on how perception developed as the child grows. I also knew that at City College of New York she’d been greatly concerned about students’ underachievement. I felt she’d be the ideal partner in my inquiry.</p>
<p class="indent">“It comes down to this,” I said when we met. “I don’t think most classroom failure is a matter of lack of talent. Our new data show that if a school kid is depressed, his classroom performance nosedives.”</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="c08-nts2a"/>I elaborated a bit and then told Joan about Carol Dweck’s latest findings, <a id="page142"/>which pointed to pessimistic explanatory style as the culprit in poor academic performance. “I just heard through the grapevine,” I said, “about Carol’s latest work. She divided grade-school children into ‘helpless’ and ‘mastery-oriented’ groups, depending on their explanatory style. She then gave them a series of failures—unsolvable problems—followed by successes—solvable problems.</p>
<p class="indent">“Before the failures, there was no difference at all between the two groups. But once they started to fail, an astonishing difference emerged. The helpless children’s problem-solving strategies deteriorated down to the first-grade level. They began to hate the task and to talk about how good they were at baseball or acting in the class play. When the mastery-oriented children failed, they stayed at their fourth-grade level in their strategies, and while acknowledging that they must be making mistakes, they stayed involved. One mastery-oriented child actually rolled up her sleeves and said, ‘I love a challenge.’ They all expressed confidence that they would soon be back on track, and they kept at it.</p>
<p class="indent">“What’s more,” I went on, “at the end when all the kids were given successes, the helpless kids still discounted their success. They predicted that in the future, they would solve only fifty percent of the kind of problems that they had just solved perfectly. The mastery-oriented kids predicted ninety percent.</p>
<p class="indent">“It seems to me,” I concluded, “that the basic problem underlying many kids’ depression and much poor schoolwork may be pessimism. When a kid believes there is nothing he can do, he stops trying, and his grades plunge. I’d like you to join me in investigating this.”</p>
<p class="indent">Joan didn’t respond to my invitation immediately. She asked more questions, and then she thought for a moment. Finally she said, “I’ve become convinced that optimism and the ability to bounce back from setbacks are keys to academic success here. But I suspect that the time of life to look at is not college and not even high school. It’s in grade school and junior high school that lifelong habits of seeing the world crystallize. Before puberty, not after.</p>
<p class="indent">“I’ve been thinking about changing my research to something that connects more directly to what I’ve seen as a dean. Finding out about depression, school achievement, and explanatory style in kids sounds like just the right kind of thing.”</p>
<p class="indent">By one of those lucky coincidences, Susan Nolen-Hoeksema had just arrived at the University of Pennsylvania as a first-year graduate student, and she became the catalyst that made this project happen. Susan was a quietly determined twenty-one-year-old whose mentor at Yale sent me a note saying she was the best undergraduate he had seen in ten years, and <a id="page143"/>he envied the fact that she was determined to study helplessness in children. He also warned me not to mistake her quiet demeanor for either shyness or ordinariness of mind.</p>
<p class="indent">I described my conversation with Joan to Susan, and her reaction was immediate: “This is exactly what I want to spend my life doing.”</p>
<p class="indent">What followed was two years of begging school superintendents near Princeton, New Jersey, then principals, then teachers and parents, then children, and finally the National Institute of Mental Health, to let us undertake a large-scale study to predict who gets depressed and who does poorly in the grade-school classroom. We wanted to find the source of the depression that afflicts so many young children and damages their schoolwork. <a id="c08-nts3a"/>In the fall of 1985, the Princeton-Penn Longitudinal Study got under way. Four hundred third-grade children, their teachers, and their parents began an investigation that was to go on until these children finished seventh grade, nearly five years later.</p>
<p class="indent">We hypothesized that there are two major risk factors for depression and poor achievement among children:</p>
<div class="hanging1">
<p class="hanging">• <em>Pessimistic explanatory style</em>. Children who see bad events as permanent, pervasive, and personal will over time get depressed and do badly in school.</p>
<p class="hanging">• <em>Bad life events</em>. Children who suffer the most bad events—parents separating, family deaths, family job loss—will do worst.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The data for the first four years of this five-year study are now in. The greatest risk factor for later depression is, not surprisingly, an earlier bout of depression. Children who have been depressed once tend to get depressed again, and children who are depression-free in third grade tend to be depression-free in the fourth and fifth grades. We didn’t need to do a half-million-dollar study to find that out. But over and above this, we established that both explanatory style and bad life events are significant risk factors for depression.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c08-s02-s01"><em>First, Explanatory Style:</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">C<span class="small">HILDREN WITH</span> pessimistic explanatory style are at a serious disadvantage. If your child starts off in third grade with a pessimistic score on the CASQ, he is at risk for depression. We divided the children into those whose depression scores got worse as time went on and those whose depression <a id="page144"/>got better as time went on. Explanatory style separates these two groups into the following tendencies:</p>
<div class="hanging1">
<p class="hanging">• If you start off the third grade with a pessimistic style and you are not depressed, you become depressed as time goes on.</p>
<p class="hanging">• If you start off pessimistic and you are also depressed, you stay depressed.</p>
<p class="hanging">• If you start off optimistic and you are also depressed, you get better.</p>
<p class="hanging">• If you start off optimistic and you are not depressed, you stay depression-free.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Which comes first—being a pessimist or being depressed? It could be that pessimism makes you depressed, but it could also be that depression makes you see the world pessimistically. Both turn out to be true. Being depressed in the third grade makes you more pessimistic in the fourth grade, and being pessimistic in the third grade makes you more depressed in the fourth grade. The two together form a vicious circle.</p>
<p class="indent">One child we encountered, Cindy,<a class="hlink" href="#c08-ftn5" id="c08-ftn5a"><sup class="frac">*</sup></a> was caught in this vicious circle. In the winter of third grade, Cindy’s parents told her that they were separating, and her father moved out. Her explanatory-style scores had been a bit more pessimistic than average before this, but she now became listless and teary. Her depression scores went sky-high. Her schoolwork began to suffer, and she withdrew from her friends, as depressed children often do. She then began to think of herself as unloved and as stupid, and this caused her explanatory style to become more pessimistic. This pessimistic style, in turn, made it harder for her to tolerate disappointment. She interpreted even minor setbacks as meaning “Nobody likes me” or “I’m no good,” and she got even more depressed.</p>
<p class="indent">Recognizing when this vicious circle has begun in your own child and learning how to break it up is one of the crucial things parents must learn to do. You will see how in chapter thirteen.</p>
<h3 class="section" id="c08-s02-s02"><em>Second, Bad Life Events:</em></h3>
<p class="nonindent">T<span class="small">HE MORE MISFORTUNES</span> befall a child, the worse his depression. Optimistic children resist the impact of bad events better than pessimistic <a id="page145"/>children do, and popular children resist better than unpopular do. But this does not prevent bad events from having some depressing effects on all children.</p>
<p class="indent">Here are some events to watch out for. When these occur, your child can use a lot of your time and all the help and support you can muster. It’a also a good time to put the exercises you will learn about in chapter thirteen into practice.</p>
<div class="hanging1">
<p class="hanging">• A brother or sister leaves home for college or work.</p>
<p class="hanging">• A pet dies—this may seem trivial, but it is devastating.</p>
<p class="hanging">• A grandparent whom the child knows well dies.</p>
<p class="hanging">• The child moves to a new school—loss of friends can be very disruptive.</p>
<p class="hanging">• You and your spouse are fighting.</p>
<p class="hanging">• You and your spouse divorce or separate—along with parents’ fights, this is the number-one problem.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="section" id="c08-s03">Divorce and Parental Turmoil</h2>
<p class="nonindent"><a id="c08-nts4a"/>B<span class="small">ECAUSE DIVORCE</span> and serious turmoil between parents are increasing and are also the common events most depressing to children, we have focused in the Princeton-Penn Longitudinal Study on children who have experienced them.</p>
<p class="indent">When we began the study, sixty of the children—roughly 15 percent—told us their parents were divorced or separated. We have watched these children carefully for the last three years and contrasted them to the rest of the children. What they tell us has important implications for our society at large and for how you should deal with your children if divorce happens to you.</p>
<p class="indent">First—and most important—the children of divorce do badly, by and large. Tested twice a year, these children are much more depressed than the children from intact families. We had hoped the difference would diminish over time, but it doesn’t. Three years later, the children of divorce are still much more depressed than the other children. Our finding applies to all symptoms of depression: The children of divorce are sadder and they act out more in the classroom; they have less zest, lower self-esteem, and more bodily complaints; and they worry more.</p>
<p class="indent">It is important to realize that these are <em>averaged</em> findings. Some of the children did not become depressed, and some of the depressed children <a id="page146"/>recovered in time. Divorce does not doom a child to years of depression; it only makes depression much more likely.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, many more bad life events continue to happen to children of divorce. This continued disruption could be what keeps depression so high among those children. These events divide into three kinds. First are the events the divorce itself causes, or which are caused by the depression the divorce brings in its wake. These things happen more often to children of divorce:</p>
<div class="hanging1">
<p class="hanging">• Their mother starts a new job.</p>
<p class="hanging">• Their classmates are less friendly.</p>
<p class="hanging">• A parent remarries.</p>
<p class="hanging">• A parent joins a new church.</p>
<p class="hanging">• A parent is hospitalized.</p>
<p class="hanging">• The child fails a course at school.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Children of divorce also experience more ongoing events that themselves might have caused the divorce:</p>
<div class="hanging1">
<p class="hanging">• Their parents argue more.</p>
<p class="hanging">• Their fathers go on more business trips.</p>
<p class="hanging">• A parent loses a job.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Pretty unsurprising so far. But we were astonished by the last category of bad events that children of divorce suffer more of. We still don’t know what to make of these remarkable facts, but we think you should know about them:</p>
<div class="hanging1">
<p class="hanging">• The children of divorce see a sibling hospitalized three and a half times more often than children of intact families do.</p>
<p class="hanging">• The child’s own chance of being hospitalized is three and a half times greater.</p>
<p class="hanging">• The chance that a friend of the child will die is twice as great.</p>
<p class="hanging">• The chance that a grandparent will die is also twice as great.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Some of these events may be causes or consequences of divorce. But, in addition, families that divorce seem to be cursed by more kinds of misfortune that seem to have nothing to do with the divorce itself, either as cause or as consequence. We cannot imagine how the death of a good friend of the child’s or a grandparent dying could be a consequence of divorce or how it could be a contributing cause. Yet the statistics are there.</p>
<p class="indent">This all adds up to a very nasty picture for the children of divorce. It <a id="page147"/>used to be said that it is better for the children to have their unhappy parents divorce than to live with two parents who hate each other. But our findings show a bleak picture for these children: prolonged, unrelieved depression; a much higher rate of disruptive events; and, very strangely, much more apparently unrelated misfortune. It would be irresponsible for me not to advise you to take these dismaying data seriously if you are thinking about divorcing.</p>
<p class="indent">But the problem may not be the divorce itself. The root of the problem may be the parents’ fighting. We have for three years also followed seventy-five children from the Princeton Longitudinal Study whose parents have not divorced, but who say that their parents fight a lot. The children of fighting families look just as bad as the children of divorce: They are highly depressed, remain depressed long after the parents are said to stop fighting, and suffer more untoward life events than children from intact families whose parents don’t fight.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two possible ways fighting between parents might hurt children so lastingly. The first is that parents who have grown very unhappy with each other fight and then separate. The fighting and separation directly disturb the child, causing long-term depression. The second possibility is more like traditional wisdom: Parents who fight and separate are very unhappy with each other. The fighting and separation themselves have little direct effect on the child, but the child is aware of his parents’ great unhappiness and that so disturbs the child as to produce long-term depression. There is nothing in our data to tell us which of these two theories is right.</p>
<p class="indent">What does this mean for you?</p>
<p class="indent">Many people are in rocky marriages, filled with strife and conflict. Less dramatic, but more common, is this situation: After several years of marriage, many people don’t like their spouses much anymore. This is fertile ground for fighting. But at the same time, both parents are often overwhelmingly concerned with the well-being of the children.</p>
<p class="indent">It seems to be a plain fact—at least statistically—that either separation or fighting in response to an unhappy marriage is likely to harm your children in lasting ways. If it turns out that parents’ unhappiness rather than overt fighting is the culprit, I would suggest marital counseling aimed at coming to terms with the shortcomings of the marriage.</p>
<p class="indent">But if the act of fighting and the choice to separate turn out to be responsible for children’s depression, very different advice follows if your children’s interest—not your own life satisfaction—is primary for you. Are you willing to forgo separation? An even harder challenge: Are you willing to choose to refrain from fighting?</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="c08-nts5a"/>I am not naïve enough to advise you never to fight. Fighting sometimes <a id="page148"/>works: The problem resolves and the situation improves. But many marital fights are unproductive. I cannot advise you on how to fight productively, since I have no special expertise about this. The only piece of solid research I know about on <em>how</em> to fight concerns resolution. Children who watch films of adults fighting are much less disturbed when the fight ends with a clear resolution. This suggests that when you fight, you should go out of your way to resolve the quarrel, unambiguously and in front of your child.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="c08-nts6a"/>I believe it is important, beyond this, to be aware at the moment you choose to fight that your fighting may harm your children. You may well consider fighting your sacred right. After all, we live in an age when many people consider letting it all hang out healthy and legitimate. It is deemed perfectly all right, if you are angry, to fight, and fight, and fight. This attitude comes out of Freudian views of the negative consequences of bottling up anger. But what happens if you turn the other cheek? On the one hand, unexpressed anger does cause at least momentary rises in blood pressure, and therefore might possibly contribute—in the long run—to psychosomatic problems. On the other hand, letting anger out often causes delicately poised relationships to topple. Anger escalates and, unresolved, begins to take on a life of its own. The couple winds up living in a balance of recriminations.</p>
<p class="indent">But these consequences of not fighting affect you and your spouse. As far as your children are concerned, there is very little to be said in favor of parents’ fighting. Therefore, I choose to go against the prevailing ethic and recommend that, if it is your children you care most about, you step back and think twice or three times before you fight. Being angry and fighting are <em>not</em> a human right. Consider swallowing anger, sacrificing pride, putting up with less than you deserve from your spouse. Step back before provoking your spouse and before answering a provocation. Fighting is a human choice, and it is your child’s well-being, more than yours, that may be at stake.</p>
<p class="indent">Our research shows the following chain of events to be common: Parental fighting or separation leads to a marked increase in the child’s depression. The depression itself then causes school problems to increase and explanatory style to become much more pessimistic. School problems combine with this newly minted pessimism to maintain depression, and a vicious circle has begun. Depression now becomes a permanent way of life for your child.</p>
<p class="indent">An escalation of parental fighting, or the decision to separate, marks exactly the point at which your child needs extra help to prevent depression and the shift to pessimism, and to ward off school problems. This is exactly when he will need special help from his teachers and from you. <a id="page149"/>Go out of your way to be very close to your child. One major loving relationship, undisturbed, may counteract the effects of fighting. This is also the time to consider professional help. Therapy for you and your spouse may teach you to fight less and more productively. Therapy for your child at this stage of your marriage just might prevent a lifetime of depression for him.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c08-s04">Girls vs. Boys</h2>
<p class="nonindent">T<span class="small">HE DISASTROUS</span> long-term effects of divorce and fighting were not the only data that surprised us. We had been very interested in sex differences. We had strong expectations about which sex should be more depressed and pessimistic, but when we looked at our data, we found the opposite—over and over again.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="c08-nts7a"/>As you know from chapters four and five, adult women are much more depressed on average than men. Twice as many women are found to suffer depression—whether the phenomenon is measured by treatment statistics, by door-to-door surveys, or by number of symptoms. We supposed that this must begin in childhood and that we would find that girls are more depressed than boys and have a more pessimistic explanatory style.</p>
<p class="indent">Not so. At every point in our study, <em>the boys are more depressed than the girls</em>. The average boy will have many more depressive symptoms and suffer more severe depression than the average girl. Among the boys in the third and fourth grades, a whopping 35 percent are found to be severely depressed at least once in the third and fourth grades. Among the girls only 21 percent showed severe depression. The difference is confined to two sets of symptoms: The boys show more behavioral disturbance (e.g., “I get in trouble all the time”) and more anhedonia (lack of enjoyment, not enough friends, social withdrawal). In sadness, diminished self-esteem, and bodily symptoms, the boys do not exceed the girls.</p>
<p class="indent">The explanatory-style differences are parallel. To our surprise, the girls are more optimistic than the boys, at each measuring. They are more optimistic than the boys about good events and less pessimistic about bad ones.</p>
<p class="indent">So the Princeton-Penn Longitudinal Study yielded another surprise. Boys are more pessimistic and more depressed than girls, and boys are more fragile in their response to bad events, including divorce. This means that whatever causes the huge difference in depression in adulthood, with women twice as vulnerable as men, it does not have its roots in childhood. Something must happen at or shortly after puberty that causes a flip-flop <a id="page150"/>—and hits girls very hard indeed. We can only guess what this might be. But the children we are following are just approaching puberty now, so in its last year the Princeton-Penn Longitudinal Study may tell us what happens around puberty that shifts the burden of depression from males to females.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c08-s05">College</h2>
<p class="nonindent">O<span class="small">NE SPRING DAY</span> in 1983 I listened to Willis Stetson, the University of Pennsylvania’s dean of admissions, describe the problems the admissions office had—actually, the errors it made. I had come because I was master of one of Penn’s colleges and had seen close up just how poor the results of the selection procedure could be. I volunteered to let the admissions office try my test out, to see if it would help predict academic success better than current methods did.</p>
<p class="indent">“After all,” Dean Stetson was complaining, “it’s just a statistical guess. We have to accept a certain number of mistakes.”</p>
<p class="indent">I asked him how Penn admits freshmen.</p>
<p class="indent">“We take three important academic factors into account,” he said. “Grades in high school, College Board scores, and achievement-test results. We have a regression equation—thank God I don’t have to explain that to <em>you</em>. We plug the three scores into the equation, and we come up with a number, like 3.1. That is in fact the students’ predicted average for the freshman year. We call it the PI, or predictive index. If it’s high enough, you get admitted.”</p>
<p class="indent">I knew, indeed, what regression equations are, and how fallible they are. A regression equation takes into account past factors, like your SAT scores and your high-school grades, and relates them to some future criterion, like grade-point average in college. It then jiggers the numbers around in order to assign a weight to each past factor and make it fit the criterion. For example, if you were trying to predict the birth weight of a baby from the weights of its parents, you might look at the last thousand babies born in a certain hospital and note their weights, and then note their parents’ weights, and you might find that if you divide the mother’s weight by 21.7 and the father’s weight by 43.4 and then average those two numbers, the result would correspond to the baby’s birth weight. There would be no significance in the number 21.7 or the number 43.4; the weights wouldn’t connect to any law of nature; they’d be statistical accidents. Regression equations are what you do when you don’t know what else to do.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page151"/>That’s what the admissions committee at the university was up to. They were taking the SATs and high-school grades for several freshman classes running and correlating the data with the grade-point average all these freshmen got. They saw then that roughly—but only roughly—the higher the SATs, the better the college grades, and the higher the high-school grades, the better the college grades.</p>
<p class="indent">But it might turn out, for instance, that the SATs were twice as good a predictor of college grades as high-school grades were, and one and a half times better than the achievement tests. So, it might turn out that 5.66 times the grades in high school plus 3.21 times the achievement-test scores plus 2.4 times the SAT total best “fit” later freshman grades, when all the results were averaged over the last ten freshman classes. The weights are arbitrary, chosen because they happen to fit. For this reason, college-grade prediction is very much a statistical guess. You get the majority right, but you make lots of errors. And lots of errors mean disappointed, complaining parents, overworked professors, and undergraduate academic misfits.</p>
<p class="indent">“We make two kinds of errors,” Dean Stetson continued. “First, some students—a small number, I’m happy to say—do much worse as freshmen than they are expected to do. Second, a much larger number do much better than their PI. Even so, we’d like to decrease our margin of error. Tell me more about this test of yours.”</p>
<p class="indent">I explained the ASQ and the theory behind it. I told the dean that people determined by the test to be optimists do better than they are expected to do, probably because they try harder in the face of challenge, whereas pessimists give up when they fail. For more than an hour I went over the ASQ and how it worked. I told him what we were doing with the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and discussed what the consequences of the ASQ for University of Pennsylvania admissions might be: a further reduction in the margin of error, and the ability to predict freshman grades over and above the PI. “You’re missing some good kids,” I said, “and you’re admitting some others who will only crash. Either way, it’s a tragedy for the kids and bad for Penn.”</p>
<p class="indent">Finally Dean Stetson said: “Let’s give it a shot. Let’s try it on the class of ’87.”</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="c08-nts8a"/>So the week the class of ’87 arrived, over three hundred of them took the ASQ. And then we just waited. We waited for them to suffer through their first midterms and the grueling two weeks of final exams. We waited for these students—many of whom were all-stars in high school—to find out what the competition at a major university was like. We waited for some to go under and some to rise to the challenge.</p>
<p class="indent">At the end of the first semester, we saw the errors that the dean worried about. Fully one-third of the students had done either much better or much <a id="page152"/>worse than their SATs, high-school grades, and achievement tests predicted. Of these hundred freshmen about twenty did much worse and about eighty did much better.</p>
<p class="indent">We saw what we expected by now—the same thing we were seeing with life-insurance salesmen and with fourth-graders. Freshmen who rose to the occasion and did much better than their level of “talent” were, on the average, optimists when they entered. Those who did much worse than they should have had entered as pessimists.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c08-s06">Beast Barracks</h2>
<p class="nonindent">F<span class="small">AILING A</span> midterm exam in college and getting rejected for the lead in the Easter show in third grade are pretty mild, compared to the whole range of human failure. <a id="c08-nts9a"/>But at least one academic setting produces stress on a more worldly scale: “Beast Barracks” at West Point.</p>
<p class="indent">When the nervous eighteen-year-old plebe arrives for the first time at West Point in early July, he (actually it is now also she) is greeted by an upper-class cadre whose job is to teach him iron discipline for the rest of the summer—standing at attention for long periods, ten-mile dawn marches at double time, shining and reshining brass, memorizing line after line of fraternal nonsense, and obedience, obedience, obedience. The point is to mold the character necessary for U.S. Army officers of the future. West Pointers think it has worked well for over 150 years.</p>
<p class="indent">As abused as he is, the plebe is a precious commodity. Plebes are selected for leadership and academic potential from a huge pool of applicants. West Point is one of the most elite of all American colleges. Plebes’ SATs are high; their athletic prowess is exceptional; their high-school grades, particularly in engineering-related courses, have been outstanding; and, most important of all, they have been conspicuously fine members of their community—the eagle scouts. The education of one West Pointer costs around $250,000 and each empty spot in the graduating class can be reckoned as a loss to the taxpayer of this magnitude. Yet many cadets are wasted along the way by the rigors of the program—quite a number before they even begin it.</p>
<p class="indent">I learned all this in February 1987, when I got a call from Richard Butler, the head of personnel research for West Point. “Dr. Seligman,” he began in a crisp voice that sounded accustomed to command, “I think Uncle Sam needs you. We have a dropout problem at West Point that you might be able to do something about. We admit twelve hundred plebes a year. They arrive for Beast Barracks on July first. Six quit on the first day and by the <a id="page153"/>end of August—before classes have begun—we’ve lost a hundred. Will you try to help us predict who drops out?”</p>
<p class="indent">I consented eagerly. It sounded like an ideal setting to test the power of optimism to keep people going through the most rigorous academic setting I had ever heard of. In principle, the pessimists should be the quitters—just as at Metropolitan Life and among University of Pennsylvania freshmen.</p>
<p class="indent">So on July 2 I drove north with a special research assistant, my fourteen-year-old son, David, to help me pass out the questionnaires. The cadre marched the entire plebe class into the gleaming new Eisenhower Auditorium, and twelve hundred of America’s choicest young people stood at attention waiting for our permission to sit down and begin the test. Beast Barracks, we were told, had been “softened” for the first time in decades. Prolonged bracing (standing at extreme attention) and food and water deprivation were now forbidden. In any case I was impressed with the spectacle, and David was awestruck.</p>
<p class="indent">Dick Butler’s statistics proved accurate. Six plebes quit on the first day, one right in the middle of the test. He got up, vomited, and raced out of the auditorium. One hundred had quit by the end of August.</p>
<p class="indent">At this writing we have now followed the class of ’91 for two years. Who quits? Once again, the pessimists. Those plebes who explained bad events by saying “It’s me, it’s going to last forever, it’s going to undermine everything I do” are at greatest risk for not making it through the rigors of Beast Barracks. Who gets better grades than the SATs predict? The optimists. And the pessimists get worse grades than their SATs predict.</p>
<p class="indent">I cannot yet recommend that a traditional place like West Point change its admission and training policies based on these first findings. But it looks to me as if selecting for optimism among our future officers could produce better leadership in the military. Even more intriguing is the possibility that using techniques of the sort you will learn later in this book to help pessimists become optimists could salvage quite a few dropouts and give them a chance to become the fine officers their talents augur.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c08-s07">Traditional Wisdom About Success at School</h2>
<p class="nonindent">F<span class="small">OR ALMOST</span> a hundred years <em>aptitude</em> and <em>talent</em> have been the code words for academic success. These idols occupy the place of honor on the altars of all admissions and personnel officials. In America you can’t even <a id="page154"/>get placed on the track unless your IQ or your SAT score or your MCAT score is high enough, and the situation is even worse in Europe.</p>
<p class="indent">I think “talent” is vastly overrated. Not only is talent imperfectly measured, not only is it an imperfect predictor of success, but also the traditional wisdom is wrong. It leaves out a factor that can compensate for low scores or greatly diminish the accomplishments of highly talented people: explanatory style.</p>
<p class="indent">Which comes first—optimism or achievement in the classroom? Common sense tells us that people become optimistic as a consequence of being talented or because they do well. But the design of our classroom studies clearly establishes that the causal arrow also points in the opposite direction. In our studies, we hold talent—SAT scores, IQ, life-insurance qualification test scores—constant to begin with and then look at what happens to the optimists and pessimists among the highly talented. Over and above their talent-test scores, we repeatedly find that pessimists drop below their “potential” and optimists exceed it.</p>
<p class="indent">I have come to think that the notion of potential, without the notion of optimism, has very little meaning.</p>
