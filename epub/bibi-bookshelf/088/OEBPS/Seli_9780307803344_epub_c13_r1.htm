<h1 class="chapter" id="c13"><a id="page235"/>13<br/><em>Helping Your Child Escape Pessimism</em></h1>
<p class="nonindent">W<span class="small">E LIKE</span> to think of childhood as an idyllic time free of the burdens of responsibility that descend upon us with age, a sheltered interval before life begins in earnest. But, as we have seen in earlier chapters, there is no shelter from pessimism and its grim offspring, depression. Many children suffer terribly from pessimism, a condition that torments them through the years to come, ruining their education and livelihoods, spoiling their happiness. School-age children have the same rate and intensity of depression as adults. Worst of all, pessimism embeds itself as a way of looking at the world, and childhood pessimism is the father and mother of adult pessimism.</p>
<p class="indent">As we noted, some studies indicate children actually learn much of their pessimism from their mothers. They also learn pessimism from the criticisms adults make of them. But if children can learn it, they can unlearn it, and they do this exactly the same way adults do: by developing more sanguine ways of explaining life’s setbacks to themselves. Although the ABC techniques have been thoroughly researched and learned by thousands of adults, less research has been done with children, but enough is now known to recommend them for your child. It might be said that teaching optimism to your children is as important as teaching them to work hard or be truthful, for it can have just as profound an impact on their later lives. Does your child need to learn the skills of optimism?</p>
<p class="indent">Some parents are a bit reluctant to intervene in the natural course of their children’s emotional growth. Your child will probably benefit from acquiring these skills, but there are three guidelines for determining if they are especially important for your child.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page236"/>First, what was your child’s score on the CASQ in chapter seven? If your girl scored less than 7.0 or your boy scored less than 5.0, she or he is twice as likely to experience depression as more optimistic children are, and will probably benefit substantially from this chapter. The lower your child’s score, the greater the benefit is likely to be.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, what did your child score on the depression test in chapter eight? If he scored 10 or higher, he can use these skills. If he scored 16 or higher, I believe that his learning these skills is essential.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, have you and your spouse been fighting, or, more drastic, is separation or divorce a possibility? If so, your child is going to need these skills urgently. We find that children often become massively depressed at such times, and stay depressed for years, with poor school performance and a permanent change toward pessimistic explanatory style. Intervention right now can be crucial.</p>
<p class="indent">With this chapter you can take your child through the ABC system you learned in the previous chapter. If you haven’t yet read that chapter, or haven’t read it recently, you should; familiarity with that material will make you a better instructor.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c13-s01">ABCs for Your Child</h2>
<p class="nonindent">S<span class="small">EEING THE CONNECTION</span> between adversity, belief, and consequences is the first step for your child to take in learning optimism. The exercises below attempt to teach that connection. They are designed for children between the ages of eight and fourteen. Younger children may find them difficult, but if you are patient with them and if your child is cerebral enough, you can do this with a child as young as seven. Older children, full-blown teenagers, should do the adult exercises; they will feel patronized by the child examples.</p>
<p class="indent">Teaching optimism to your child benefits both of you. The benefit to your child is obvious. But teaching is also the best way of learning something well yourself. Through teaching these skills to your child, your own grasp of them will improve enormously.</p>
<p class="indent">Here’s how to start. Once you have read the previous chapter and done the adult exercises, set aside half an hour with your child. First explain the ABC model to him. The point you want to get across is that how he feels doesn’t just come out of nowhere. Make it clear that what he <em>thinks</em> when things go badly actually changes how he feels. When he suddenly <a id="page237"/>feels sad or angry or afraid or embarrassed, a thought has always triggered the feeling. If he can learn to find that thought, he can change it.</p>
<p class="indent">Once the child gets the general drift, work through each of the following three examples with him. After each example, have him explain it to you in his own words, concentrating on the connection between the beliefs and the consequences. After he explains it in his own words, go over the questions at the end of each example.</p>
<div class="block">
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Adversity:</em> My teacher, Mr. Minner, yelled at me in front of the whole class, and everybody laughed.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Belief:</em> He hates me and now the whole class thinks I’m a jerk.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Consequences:</em> I felt really sad and I wished that I could just disappear under my desk.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Ask your child why the boy felt sad. Why did he want to disappear? If he had a different belief about Mr. Minner—for example, if he thought, “The whole class knows Mr. Minner is unfair”—how would the consequences have been different? Would the class think the boy was a jerk?</p>
<p class="indent">The beliefs are the crucial step to the consequences; when they change, the consequences do too.</p>
<div class="block">
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Adversity:</em> My best friend, Susan, told me that Joannie was her new best friend and from now on she was going to sit with Joannie in the cafeteria and not with me.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Belief:</em> Susan doesn’t like me anymore because I’m not cool enough. Joannie tells really funny jokes, and whenever I tell a joke <em>nobody</em> laughs. And Joannie has really cool clothes, and I dress like a dweeb. I bet if I was more popular Susan would still want to be best friends with me. Now I’m never going to have anybody to sit with at lunch, and everybody is going to know that Joannie is Susan’s new best friend.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Consequences:</em> I was really scared to go to lunch because I didn’t want to get laughed at and have to eat by myself, so I pretended to have a stomachache, and I asked Miss Frankel to send me to the nurse. I also felt really ugly, and I wanted to change schools.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Why did this girl want to change schools? Was it the fact that Susan was going to sit with Joannie? Or was it the belief that she would never have anyone to sit with? Why did she feel ugly? What role did her beliefs about dressing like a dweeb play? How would the consequences have changed if this child believed Susan was a fickle twit?</p>
<div class="block">
<p class="bl_indent"><a id="page238"/><em>Adversity:</em> While I was waiting at the bus stop with my friends a bunch of ninth-graders came by and started calling me “Fatso” and “Blubber” right in front of all my friends.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Belief:</em> There’s nothing I can say back, because they’re right, I <em>am</em> a fatso. Now all my friends are going to laugh at me, and nobody will want to sit with me on the bus. Everybody is going to start teasing me and calling me names, and I’m just going to have to take it.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Consequences:</em> I felt like dying, I was so embarrassed. I wanted to run away from my friends, but I didn’t because it was the last bus. So I just put my head down and decided to sit by myself in the very first seat right by the driver.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Why did this boy want to run away from his friends? Was it because of the fact he was called “Fatso” or the belief that all his friends were now going to reject him? Were there other, more constructive beliefs he might have entertained—“My friends are loyal,” for example, or “My friends all think those ninth-graders are jerks”? What would have happened then?</p>
<p class="extract">O<span class="small">NCE YOU</span> see your child grasps the ABC concept, you should end the session. When you do, set aside half an hour for tomorrow, in which your child will learn to put ABC into practice in his own life.</p>
<p class="indent">In the next session, start by reviewing the adversity-belief-consequences link, and work over one of the examples again if necessary. Next, ask him for an example from his own life, and write it down. If he needs prompting, use one or two ABCs from your own record.</p>
<p class="indent">Now tell him it’s his turn to find ABCs in his daily life. His assignment for the next few days is to bring home one example and discuss it with you. Each day after school, record and discuss the example. Emphasize how sadness, anger, fear, and giving up are all produced by his beliefs, and hint broadly that these beliefs are not inevitable or unchangeable. He may well come home with all five examples in the first day or two. When he has found his five examples, you are ready to go on to the next phase, disputation.</p>

<h2 class="section" id="c13-s02">ABCDE for Your Child</h2>
<p class="nonindent">D<span class="small">ISPUTATION</span> for children is the same process as disputation for adults. Once your child grasps the ABC link, you can explain the disputation–energization link. Set aside forty minutes; begin by reviewing the ABC link. Use two of the child’s own examples from his ABC record to review. Explain to your child that just because he has those thoughts does not <a id="page241"/>mean the thoughts are true. They can be disputed, just as if some other child, who hated him, said those things about him.</p>
<p class="indent">Taking one of his own examples, ask your child to imagine his worst enemy had said that about him. How would your child respond? When he gives one good response ask him to give another and another, until he can’t think of any more. Now explain that he can dispute his own negative thoughts in just the same way he can dispute the accusations of others—but with better effect: When the negatives he says to himself are disputed, he will stop believing them, and will become more cheerful and able to do more.</p>
<p class="indent">Now you will need to use some examples and work each one through completely with your child. Here are four examples to use—two old ones and two new ones:</p>
<div class="block">
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Adversity:</em> My teacher, Mr. Minner, yelled at me in front of the whole class, and everybody laughed.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Belief:</em> He hates me and now the whole class thinks I’m a jerk.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Consequences:</em> I felt really sad and I wished that I could just disappear under my desk.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Disputation:</em> Just because Mr. Minner yelled at me, it doesn’t mean he hates me. Mr. Minner yells at just about everybody, and he told our class we were his favorite class. I guess I was goofing around a little, so I don’t blame him for getting mad. Everyone in the class, well everyone except for maybe Linda but she’s a goody-goody, but everybody else has been yelled at by Mr. Minner at <em>least</em> once, so I doubt they think I’m a jerk.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Energization:</em> I still felt a little sad about being yelled at, but not nearly as much, and I didn’t feel like disappearing under my desk anymore.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Reread the belief aloud. Ask your child to dispute it in his own words. Ask your child to explain how each point in his dispute works: How does realizing that Mr. Minner yells at everybody counteract “Mr. Minner hates me”?</p>
<div class="block">
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Adversity:</em> My best friend, Susan, told me Joannie was her new best friend and from now on she was going to sit with Joannie in the cafeteria and not me.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Belief:</em> Susan doesn’t like me anymore because I’m not cool enough. Joannie tells really funny jokes, and whenever I tell a joke <em>nobody</em> laughs. And Joannie has really cool clothes, and I dress like a dweeb.</p>
</div>
<div class="block">
<p class="bl_nonindent"><a id="page242"/>I bet if I was more popular, Susan would still want to be best friends with me. Now I’m never going to have anybody to sit with at lunch, and everybody is going to know that Joannie is Susan’s new best friend.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Consequences:</em> I was really scared to go to lunch because I didn’t want to get laughed at and have to eat by myself, so I pretended to have a stomachache, and I asked Miss Frankel to send me to the nurse. I also felt really ugly, and I wanted to change schools.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Disputation:</em> Susan is really nice and all, but this isn’t the first time she has told me she had a new best friend. I remember a while ago she told me that Connie was going to be her best friend and before she told me that Jacklyn was her new best friend. I don’t think it matters how funny my jokes are, and it can’t be my clothes because Susan and I bought the exact same outfits last time we went to the mall. I guess she just likes to keep switching best friends. Oh well, she’s not my only friend; I can sit with Jessica and Latanya at lunch.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Energization:</em> I wasn’t as worried about who to eat with, and I didn’t feel ugly anymore.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Reread the belief and the consequences out loud. Ask your child to dispute the belief in his own words. Prompt him if necessary. Ask him to explain how each of his points counters the belief: How does realizing that Susan picks a new best friend every few weeks provide evidence against “Susan doesn’t like me anymore”? What is the evidence against “I dress like a dweeb”?</p>
<div class="block">
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Adversity:</em> Today in gym class Mr. Riley picked two kids to be captains for kickball, and the rest of us had to line up and get picked by one of the kids to be on their team. I was the third-to-last kid picked.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Belief:</em> Chrissy and Seth hate me. They don’t want me on their teams. Now everyone in the whole entire class thinks I’m a spaz, and no one is ever going to want me on their team again. I really am a spaz; no wonder no one wants to play with me.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Consequences:</em> I felt so stupid and I almost started crying, but I knew if I did cry everyone would laugh at me even worse. So I just kinda stood by myself and prayed the ball wouldn’t come to me.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Disputation:</em> The truth is I’m really not so good at sports. But calling myself a spaz only makes me feel worse about it. So I’m not so good at gym, there are other things I’m the best at. Like whenever the teacher tells us to break up into study groups, all the kids want <a id="page243"/>to be in my group. And the essay I wrote about the American Revolution won first prize. I don’t think Chrissy and Seth really hate me. They just wanted to have the best kickball players on their team. It’s not like they are ever mean to me or anything. Oh well, some kids are good at gym and some kids are good at other things. I just happen to be good at other things like math and reading and social studies.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Energization:</em> After I said those things to myself I felt a lot better. I still wish I was good at <em>everything</em>, and I still hate being the last to be picked for teams, but at least I know that in some things I’m the first to be picked and that Chrissy and Seth don’t hate me.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Ask your child to do the disputation in his own words and to explain in his own words all the evidence against “Chrissy and Seth hate me.” What other evidence might he have looked for to counter this belief?</p>
<div class="block">
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Adversity:</em> Yesterday was my brother’s birthday and my mom and stepdad gave him all sorts of toys and a huge cake and they didn’t even look at me.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Belief:</em> Temple has always been their favorite. Whatever Temple wants, Temple gets. They don’t even know I exist. I know why they like him better than me—because he gets better grades than me, and on his report card his teacher said he was “super” and on my report card Ms. Crisanti said my penmanship “needs improvement.”</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Consequences:</em> I felt really sad and lonely, and I was scared that my mom was going to tell me she didn’t want me around anymore.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Disputation:</em> Of course Mom and Troy are giving Temple all sorts of toys and things—it’s his birthday. When it was my birthday, they gave me lots of presents too. They may be paying more attention to him today, but that doesn’t mean they like him better. They’re just trying to make him feel special because it’s his birthday. I guess I do wish my teacher called me “super” like Temple’s teacher did, but my teacher said good things about me under Class Participation and also Science. Anyway, Mom and Troy always say they don’t compare my grades to Temple’s, that they compare us only to ourselves, and that as long as we try our hardest they will be happy.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Energization:</em> I wasn’t scared my mom was going to tell me to leave anymore, and I didn’t feel so bad about the attention Temple was getting because I know when <em>my</em> birthday comes around again, he’ll be feeling the same way.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page244"/>When your child has the hang of the examples, you can end the session. The next night, hold another forty-minute session. Begin by reviewing the link between disputation and energization, using the example he did best with during the last session.</p>
<p class="indent">Now it’s his turn. Turn back to his own ABC record. Take each of the five instances and get him to dispute the beliefs. Help him by using the evidence, alternatives, implications, and usefulness techniques, but it is not necessary to teach him these four categories. Just use them to teach him.</p>
<p class="indent">Then give him his assignment: Once a day for the next five days, he is actually to dispute a negative belief that occurs in his life. Each evening you and he will write it down and review it. At the end of each session, prime him by reminding him of various adversities he is likely to run into the next day and how to use disputation with them.</p>

<h2 class="section" id="c13-s03">Externalization of Voices for Your Child</h2>
<p class="nonindent">T<span class="small">HE FINAL EXERCISE</span> to do with your child is the externalization of voices. This psychological technique takes advantage of the fact that we can examine and dispute criticisms about ourselves more easily when they issue from a neutral third party than we can when they come from a biased party. In this application, we are going to take the harsh, threatening things that run through your child’s mind and put them into the mouth of a third party: a parent helping him practice, or a hand puppet.</p>
<p class="indent">With your child’s help, you will provide the criticism, and he will respond. Ask him to help you by telling you what sort of criticisms you should make of him. Help him do that by going over his ABC record with him to extract criticisms that he frequently makes of himself.</p>
<p class="indent">Explain to him that this exercise will give him practice toward becoming an ace disputer. You will help by serving as the source of negative beliefs.</p>
<p class="indent">Remind him frequently that you don’t believe these criticisms are true, and that you are using them only because these are thoughts he himself might often have. Be very careful: You are his parent, after all, and are saying things that, since they are based upon intimate knowledge of him, are bound to be close to the mark, possibly too close. The last thing you want to do is to express serious criticisms that your child will take to heart and be wounded by.</p>
<p class="indent">If your child is still young enough to enjoy puppets, one good way of putting some distance between you, as loving parent, and the more difficult <a id="page248"/>criticisms is to play the “Mr. Puppet game.” Use any hand puppet to do the talking. Here is how to introduce it:</p>
<div class="block">
<p class="bl_indent">“Everybody knows that sometimes kids say mean things about other kids. When other kids say mean, unfair things about <em>you</em>, you usually talk back to them and set them straight. That’s the right thing to do. But you and I know, from the work we’ve been doing together on the ABC reports, that sometimes people say mean, unfair things about themselves. As a matter of fact, we even know that you sometimes say things about yourself that really are wrong. You’ve got to learn how to talk back to those unfair things that you sometimes say about yourself, right? Okay. Now we’re going to use Mr. Puppet to teach you how to talk back to yourself. Mr. Puppet has read your ABC record. He knows what you say to yourself. But he’s also a mean bully, and your job is to talk back to him, to show him that his criticisms are wrong and unfair.”</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Before you begin, read through these examples aloud so your child can see the sorts of beliefs to be countered and can observe some ace disputers in action. Use Mr. Puppet to make some of the criticisms.</p>
<div class="block">
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Situation:</em> Ken is in seventh grade. He is bused to a very good school in a middle-class neighborhood. Ken is a good student, he likes the school, and he has a great bunch of friends. Every day after school he and his friends decide whose house they are going to hang out at. Ken would love to invite them all back to his house but he is painfully ashamed of his parents and where he lives. One day someone suggests they go to Ken’s house, and Ken becomes very embarrassed and tells them they can’t go to his house because, he says, “My dad is a doctor and has his office in the house.” Ken, feeling sad and ashamed because he has told his friends a lie, tells them he’s not feeling well and heads home by himself.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Accusation</em> (by Mom, but using Mr. Puppet, especially for the nastiest criticisms): You’re such a liar [Mr. Puppet]. Your dad, a doctor? That’s a joke. You’ll never be able to have the gang over to your place. It’s only a matter of time before one of them realizes no one has ever been to your house or met your parents.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Disputation:</em> I really do wish my parents and my house were like Ricky’s. I hate feeling ashamed of my parents and where I live. But I guess there’s not much I can do about that. Anyway, I’m not the <a id="page249"/>only one whose house we’ve never been to. Actually, most of the time we just go to Henry’s since it’s the closest.</p>
<p class="bl_indent">Mom (sometimes speaking as Mr. Puppet) interrupts: They’re going to find out that you live in a dump, that your father’s a drunk, and that your mom is a maid. And when they do, there is no way they’re going to want to hang out with you anymore. You’ll be the laughingstock of the entire school [Mr. Puppet].”</p>
<p class="bl_indent">Disputation continues: I’d definitely feel like a jerk if the guys found out my dad is a bum, but I don’t think they’d stop being my friends because of it. They’re not hanging out with me because they think I’m some rich kid. I mean, if I found out Stewie’s dad didn’t have a job, I’d probably feel bad for Stewie but I wouldn’t drop him. Gosh, I don’t know what everyone else’s parents do for a living or where they all live. For all I know, some of the guys’ parents might be as bad off as mine. Oh well, I’m not going to invite the gang home with me any time soon, but I’m going to try to stop lying about things.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Read the accusations aloud again. Ask your child to dispute them now, in his own words. Interrupt with more accusations and have him dispute these.</p>
<div class="block">
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Situation:</em> Lynn is invited to a slumber party by a girl she really thinks is neat. When her mom drops her off, Lynn realizes Betsy’s parents aren’t home and that the girls are planning to drink some of her parents’ liquor. Lynn feels really uncomfortable and pretends to be sick and calls her mom to come get her.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Accusation</em> (by parent): If you didn’t want to drink, at least you should have told the truth instead of pretending to be sick. But instead you took the easy way out. You don’t have any guts [Mr. Puppet].</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Disputation:</em> I do too have guts. The <em>real</em> easy way would be to go with the gang and drink just because they were drinking. Faking being sick was smart because it got me out of the situation without being called names or being pressured.</p>
<p class="bl_indent">Parent (as Mr. Puppet) interrupts: You’re such a baby. The first time you get invited to hang out with Betsy, and what do you do? You go and wreck it by being a Goody Two-Shoes.</p>
<p class="bl_indent">Disputation continues: I didn’t wreck the slumber party. I wouldn’t have had fun if I stayed because I would have been too scared Betsy’s <a id="page250"/>parents would come home. Oh well, maybe Betsy wouldn’t make such a great friend.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Now read the accusation aloud again and have your child dispute it in his own words. Interrupt if necessary. Can your child add anything to this dispute to make it more convincing?</p>
<div class="block">
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Situation:</em> After much pleading, Anita’s parents bought her the puppy she’s been wanting. But after only a few weeks, Anita has lost interest in Hogan and has been very forgetful about feeding and walking him. Finally, Anita’s parents tell her they are going to give Hogan away unless Anita acts more responsibly. Anita screams, “You guys are sooooo mean. You never wanted me to have a puppy in the first place. You’re just looking for an excuse to take him away from me!”</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Accusation</em> (by parent): You’ve got the meanest parents in the whole world!</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Disputation:</em> Okay, I guess I don’t have the meanest parents in the <em>world</em>. They’re okay. They did get me Hogan in the first place, and for my birthday my dad took me and Deb into New York City for the day. That was really great of him.</p>
<p class="bl_indent">Parent (as Mr. Puppet) interrupts: He’s your dog. They bought him for you, and now they’re trying to get rid of him. They just don’t want you to have any fun.</p>
<p class="bl_indent">Disputation continues: Maybe the reason they’re so mad is ’cause I haven’t been walking and feeding Hogan as much as I said I would. I did tell them that if they let me get a puppy, I would take full responsibility. But I didn’t realize it would be this much work. Maybe if I tried harder to walk him and feed him every day, they’d be willing to help me a little. I guess I ought to talk to Mom and Dad about this.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Reread the accusation aloud and ask your child to dispute it himself in his own words.</p>
<p class="indent">Now do a few of your child’s own criticisms of himself from his ABC record, using Mr. Puppet. Afterward, praise him and then, if his attention is still fresh, switch to this last example. In this example, three people are all accusing themselves and all disputing their own accusations. It is therefore a somewhat complex example and better suited to children aged ten and older. If you think your child is too young for it, omit it and turn to the material that follows it.</p>

<p class="bl_indent"><a id="page251"/><em>Situation:</em> Hope is fourteen years old, and her sister Meagan is fifteen. A few months ago their parents separated. Hope and Meagan live with their mother, but they see their father all day Sundays and on Thursday nights for dinner. Every Sunday the same pattern is followed. Their father picks them up at the house. Hope sits in the front of the car, Meagan sits in the back. Hope turns on the radio, her father turns it down. Their father asks, “How are things going?” Hope mutters “Fine” and turns up the radio. Meagan, hating the way Hope acts, takes responsibility for carrying the conversation. Finally, angry and frustrated, their father snaps off the radio, Hope mutters something sarcastic under her breath, and Meagan is silent.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Hope’s Accusation:</em> Okay, here we go again. Another fun-filled, action-packed Sunday. Dad thinks he can just waltz into our lives for one day and one dinner a week and everything is going to be swell. How can he ask “How are things going?” and expect me to be able to answer? Of course things aren’t going well. He and Mom are separated, and I have to give up my Sundays to spend time with someone who I should be seeing every day. If he really cared about how I’m doing, he would call more often and not just spend time with me because it happens to be a particular day of the week.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Hope’s Disputation:</em> Sundays are such a drag. Maybe part of the reason they’re so miserable is because we’re all so tense. I mean, it shouldn’t have to be this way. I guess I could try to relax a little and stop bothering Dad by turning up the radio real loud and giving one-word answers. Maybe Dad doesn’t realize it’s hard to respond to a question like that. Maybe he’s just saying “How are things going?” the way my friends and I say “What’s up?” I mean, granted it’s not an ideal situation, but I’m lucky he lives close by and that we can see each other. Some of my friends whose parents have split up don’t even get to see their fathers at all. I don’t like spending every Sunday with him. Sometimes I want to hang out with my friends on Sunday. I’d like it better if we decided each week which day would suit us best. That way it wouldn’t feel like another thing I <em>had</em> to do. I ought to tell him that. I really don’t understand why he doesn’t call us more, but I shouldn’t automatically assume it’s because he doesn’t care. I can start calling him, after all, whenever I feel like talking, instead of waiting for him to call me. It bothers me that he doesn’t call more often, but I guess it makes more sense to ask him why he doesn’t call instead of jumping to conclusions. Maybe I’ll bring some of this up later today.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Meagan’s Accusation:</em> Here we go again. We’ve been in the car for all of five minutes and already Dad and Hope are at it. I should be <a id="page252"/>able to keep things running smoothly. What’s wrong with me? All I needed to do was keep the conversation going and things would have been fine. If I can’t do a simple thing like that, how are things ever going to be good again? I’ve really ruined things now.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Meagan’s Disputation:</em> Maybe I’m being a little too hard on myself. I mean, it does take two people to have a conversation. I can talk and talk until I’m blue in the face but if neither of them responds, then it won’t do any good. I just want so desperately for things to be calm and easy again that I guess I’m trying to control things that just aren’t possible for me to control. I can be relaxed and pleasant and talkative, but I can’t make things be the same. This really stinks. Well, at least I know it isn’t my fault that the two of them are bickering.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Dad’s Accusation:</em> What the hell is going on? Every Sunday it’s the same thing. The second we’re in the car, Hope flips on the radio and all but drowns out what I say. I just don’t understand her. Doesn’t she want to see me? I mean, I know the kids would rather their mother and I were still together, but they have to accept the way things are and make the best of it. Meagan is handling things fine. Why does Hope have to spoil things? The two of them probably think the separation is all my fault. They get to see their mother all day, every day, and instead of having a good time when we’re together, I’m treated like a total stranger. I deserve to be treated better than that.</p>
<p class="bl_indent"><em>Dad’s Disputation:</em> Things really are rough right now. I have to try and slow down and think them through. First of all, Hope has never said she doesn’t want to see me. Maybe the reason she’s so hostile is because she’s still really confused by the separation. I guess I’m forgetting they’re just kids and the separation has really shaken up their whole world. It probably doesn’t help to compare the way Hope is handling things to the way Meagan is. Meagan is older and she has always been the quieter one. Actually, I shouldn’t assume that just because Meagan isn’t hostile that she is totally fine with the way things are either. With Hope, at least I know she is upset. I really have no idea about what is going through Meagan’s mind. Maybe part of the reason I get so angry so quickly is because I feel frustrated by the situation. I want things to be better, but it’s difficult for me to talk about the separation with them. Well, I guess I’d better work at that, because they’re just kids and it’s my responsibility as their father to bring up the subject, even if it is painful to talk about.</p>
