<h1 class="chapter" id="c01"><a id="page3"/>1<br/><em>Two Ways of Looking at Life</em></h1>
<p class="nonindent">T<span class="small">HE FATHER</span> is looking down into the crib at his sleeping newborn daughter, just home from the hospital. His heart is overflowing with awe and gratitude for the beauty of her, the perfection.</p>
<p class="indent">The baby opens her eyes and stares straight up.</p>
<p class="indent">The father calls her name, expecting that she will turn her head and look at him. Her eyes don’t move.</p>
<p class="indent">He picks up a furry little toy attached to the rail of the bassinet and shakes it, ringing the bell it contains. The baby’s eyes don’t move.</p>
<p class="indent">His heart has begun to beat rapidly. He finds his wife in their bedroom and tells her what just happened. “She doesn’t seem to respond to noise at all,” he says. “It’s as if she can’t hear.”</p>
<p class="indent">“I’m sure she’s all right,” the wife says, pulling her dressing gown around her. Together they go into the nursery.</p>
<p class="indent">She calls the baby’s name, jingles the bell, claps her hands. Then she picks up the baby, who immediately perks up, wiggling and cooing.</p>
<p class="indent">“My God,” the father says. “She’s deaf.”</p>
<p class="indent">“No she’s not,” the mother says. “I mean, it’s too soon to say a thing like that. Look, she’s brand-new. Her eyes don’t even focus yet.”</p>
<p class="indent">“But there wasn’t the slightest movement, even when you clapped as hard as you could.”</p>
<p class="indent">The mother takes a book from the shelf. “Let’s read what’s in the baby book,” she says. She looks up “hearing” and reads out loud: “ ‘Don’t be alarmed if your newborn fails to startle at loud noises or fails to orient toward sound. The startle reflex and attention to sound often take some <a id="page4"/>time to develop. Your pediatrician can test your child’s hearing neurologically.’</p>
<p class="indent">“There,” the mother says. “Doesn’t that make you feel better?”</p>
<p class="indent">“Not much,” the father says. “It doesn’t even mention the other possibility, that the baby is deaf. And all I know is that my baby doesn’t hear a thing. I’ve got the worst feeling about this. Maybe it’s because my grandfather was deaf. If that beautiful baby is deaf and it’s my fault, I’ll never forgive myself.”</p>
<p class="indent">“Hey, wait a minute,” says the wife. “You’re going off the deep end. We’ll call the pediatrician first thing Monday. In the meantime, cheer up. Here, hold the baby while I fix her blanket. It’s all pulled out.”</p>
<p class="indent">The father takes the baby but gives her back to his wife as soon as he can. All weekend he finds himself unable to open his briefcase and prepare for next week’s work. He follows his wife around the house, ruminating about the baby’s hearing and about the way deafness would ruin her life. He imagines only the worst: no hearing, no development of language, his beautiful child cut off from the social world, locked in soundless isolation. By Sunday night he has sunk into despair.</p>
<p class="indent">The mother leaves a message with the pediatrician’s answering service asking for an early appointment Monday. She spends the weekend doing her exercises, reading, and trying to calm her husband.</p>
<p class="indent">The pediatrician’s tests are reassuring, but the father’s spirits remain low. Not until a week later, when the baby shows her first startle, to the backfire of a passing truck, does he begin to recover and enjoy his new daughter again.</p>
<p class="extract">T<span class="small">HIS FATHER</span> and mother have two different ways of looking at the world. Whenever something bad happens to him—a tax audit, a marital squabble, even a frown from his employer—he imagines the worst: bankruptcy and jail, divorce, dismissal. He is prone to depression; he has long bouts of listlessness; his health suffers. She, on the other hand, sees bad events in their least threatening light. To her, they are temporary and surmountable, challenges to be overcome. After a reversal, she comes back quickly, soon regaining her energy. Her health is excellent.</p>
<p class="indent">The optimists and the pessimists: I have been studying them for the past twenty-five years. The defining characteristic of pessimists is that they tend to believe bad events will last a long time, will undermine everything they do, and are their own fault. The optimists, who are confronted with the same hard knocks of this world, think about misfortune in the opposite way. They tend to believe defeat is just a temporary setback, that its causes <a id="page5"/>are confined to this one case. The optimists believe defeat is not their fault: Circumstances, bad luck, or other people brought it about. Such people are unfazed by defeat. Confronted by a bad situation, they perceive it as a challenge and try harder.</p>
<p class="indent">These two habits of thinking about causes have consequences. Literally hundreds of studies show that pessimists give up more easily and get depressed more often. These experiments also show that optimists do much better in school and college, at work and on the playing field. They regularly exceed the predictions of aptitude tests. When optimists run for office, they are more apt to be elected than pessimists are. Their health is unusually good. They age well, much freer than most of us from the usual physical ills of middle age. Evidence suggests they may even live longer.</p>
<p class="indent">I have seen that, in tests of hundreds of thousands of people, a surprisingly large number will be found to be deep-dyed pessimists and another large portion will have serious, debilitating tendencies toward pessimism. I have learned that it is not always easy to know if you are a pessimist, and that far more people than realize it are living in this shadow. Tests reveal traces of pessimism in the speech of people who would never think of themselves as pessimists; they also show that these traces are sensed by others, who react negatively to the speakers.</p>
<p class="indent">A pessimistic attitude may seem so deeply rooted as to be permanent. I have found, however, that pessimism is escapable. Pessimists can in fact learn to be optimists, and not through mindless devices like whistling a happy tune or mouthing platitudes (“Every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better”), but by learning a new set of cognitive skills. Far from being the creations of boosters or of the popular media, these skills were discovered in the laboratories and clinics of leading psychologists and psychiatrists and then rigorously validated.</p>
<p class="indent">This book will help you discover your own pessimistic tendencies, if you have them, or those of people you care for. It will also introduce you to the techniques that have helped thousands of people undo lifelong habits of pessimism and its extension, depression. It will give you the choice of looking at your setbacks in a new light.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c01-s01">The Unclaimed Territory</h2>
<p class="nonindent">A<span class="small">T THE CORE</span> of the phenomenon of pessimism is another phenomenon—that of helplessness. Helplessness is the state of affairs in which nothing you choose to do affects what happens to you. For example, if I promise <a id="page6"/>you one thousand dollars to turn to <a class="hlink" href="Seli_9780307803344_epub_c06_r1.htm#page104">this page</a>, you will probably choose to do so, and you will succeed. If, however, I promise you one thousand dollars to contract the pupil of your eye, using only willpower, you may choose to do it, but that won’t matter. You are helpless to contract your pupil. Page turning is under your voluntary control; the muscles that change your pupillary size are not.</p>
<p class="indent">Life begins in utter helplessness. The newborn infant cannot help himself, for he<a class="hlink" href="#c01-ftn1" id="c01-ftn1a"><sup class="frac">*</sup></a> is almost entirely a creature of reflex. When he cries, his mother comes, although this does not mean that he <em>controls</em> his mother’s coming. His crying is a mere reflex reaction to pain and discomfort. He has no choice about whether he cries. Only one set of muscles in the newborn seems to be under even the barest voluntary control: the set involved in sucking. The last years of a normal life are sometimes ones of sinking back into helplessness. We may lose the ability to walk. Sadly, we may lose the mastery over our bowels and bladder that we won in our second year of life. We may lose our ability to find the word we want. Then we may lose speech itself, and even the ability to direct our thoughts.</p>
<p class="indent">The long period between infancy and our last years is a process of emerging from helplessness and gaining personal control. Personal control means the ability to change things by one’s voluntary actions; it is the opposite of helplessness. In the first three or four months of an infant’s life some rudimentary arm and leg motions come under voluntary control. The flailing of his arms refines into reaching. Then, to his parents’ dismay, crying becomes voluntary: The infant can now bawl whenever he wants his mother. He badly overuses this new power, until it stops working. The first year ends with two miracles of voluntary control: the first steps and the first words. If all goes well, if the growing child’s mental and physical needs are at least minimally met, the years that follow are ones of diminishing helplessness and of growing personal control.</p>
<p class="indent">Many things in life are beyond our control—our eye color, our race, the drought in the Midwest. But there is a vast, unclaimed territory of actions over which we can take control—or cede control to others or to fate. These actions involve the way we lead our lives, how we deal with other people, how we earn our living—all the aspects of existence in which we normally have some degree of choice.</p>
<p class="indent">The way we think about this realm of life can actually diminish or enlarge <a id="page7"/>the control we have over it. Our thoughts are not merely reactions to events; they change what ensues. For example, if we think we are helpless to make a difference in what our children become, we will be paralyzed when dealing with this facet of our lives. The very thought “Nothing I do matters” prevents us from acting. And so we cede control to our children’s peers and teachers, and to circumstance. When we overestimate our helplessness, other forces will take control and shape our children’s future.</p>
<p class="indent">Later in this book we will see that judiciously employed, mild pessimism has its uses. But twenty-five years of study has convinced me that if we <em>habitually</em> believe, as does the pessimist, that misfortune is our fault, is enduring, and will undermine everything we do, more of it will befall us than if we believe otherwise. I am also convinced that if we are in the grip of this view, we will get depressed easily, we will accomplish less than our potential, and we will even get physically sick more often. Pessimistic prophecies are self-fulfilling.</p>
<p class="indent">A poignant example is the case of a young woman I knew, a student at a university where I once taught. For three years her advisor, a professor of English literature, had been extremely helpful, almost affectionate. His backing, along with her high grades, had won her a scholarship to study at Oxford for her junior year. When she returned from England, her main interest had shifted from Dickens, her advisor’s specialty, to earlier British novelists, particularly Jane Austen, the specialty of one of his colleagues. Her advisor tried to persuade her to do her senior paper on Dickens, but seemed to accept without resentment her decision to work on Austen and agreed to continue as her co-advisor.</p>
<p class="indent">Three days before her oral examination, the original advisor sent a note to the examining committee accusing the young woman of plagiarism in her senior thesis. Her crime, he said, was failing to give credit to two scholarly sources for her statements about Jane Austen’s adolescence, in effect taking credit for those perceptions herself. Plagiarism is the gravest of academic sins, and the young woman’s whole future—her fellowship to graduate school, even graduation itself—was threatened.</p>
<p class="indent">When she looked at the passages the professor said she had failed to credit, she found that both had come from the same source—the professor himself. She had gotten them during a casual conversation with him, in which he had spoken of the perceptions as just his own thoughts on the matter; he had never mentioned the published sources from which he had obtained them. The young woman had been sandbagged by a mentor jealous of losing her.</p>
<p class="indent">Many people would have reacted with fury at the professor. Not Elizabeth. Her habit of pessimistic thinking took over. To the committee, she <a id="page8"/>was certain, she would appear guilty. And, she told herself, there was no way she could prove otherwise. It would be her word against his, and he was a professor. Instead of defending herself, she collapsed inwardly, looking at every aspect of the situation in the worst possible light. It was all her own fault, she told herself. It really didn’t matter that the professor had gotten the ideas from someone else. The main thing was that she had “stolen” the ideas, since she had failed to credit the professor. She had cheated, she believed; she <em>was</em> a cheat, and she probably always had been.</p>
<p class="indent">It may seem incredible that she could blame herself when she was so obviously innocent. But careful research shows that people with pessimistic habits of thinking can transform mere setbacks into disasters. One way they do this is by converting their own innocence into guilt. Elizabeth dredged up memories that seemed to her to confirm her extreme verdict: the time in seventh grade when she had copied test answers from another girl’s paper; the time in England when she had failed to correct the misimpression of some English friends that she came from a wealthy family. And now this act of “cheating” in the writing of her thesis. She stood silent at her hearing before the examining committee and was denied her degree.</p>
<p class="indent">This story does not have a happy ending. With the washout of her plans, her life was ruined. For the past ten years she has worked as a salesgirl. She has few aspirations. She no longer writes, or even reads literature. She is still paying for what she considered her crime.</p>
<p class="indent">There was no crime, only a common human frailty: a pessimistic habit of thinking. If she had said to herself, “I was robbed. The jealous bastard set me up,” she would have risen to her own defense and told her story. The professor’s dismissal from an earlier teaching job for doing the same thing might have emerged. She would have graduated with high honors—if only she had had different habits of thinking about the bad events in her life.</p>
<p class="indent">Habits of thinking need not be forever. One of the most significant findings in psychology in the last twenty years is that individuals can choose the way they think.</p>
<p class="indent">The science of psychology has not always cared about individual styles of thinking, or about individual human action or the individual at all. Quite the opposite. When I was a graduate student in psychology, twenty-five years ago, dilemmas such as the one I’ve just described were not explained the way they are today. At that time people were assumed to be products of their environment. The prevailing explanation of human action was that people were “pushed” by their internal drives or “pulled” by external events. Though the details of the pushing and pulling depended on the particular theory you happened to hold, in outline all the fashionable <a id="page9"/>theories agreed on this proposition. The Freudians held that unresolved childhood conflicts drove adult behavior. The followers of B. F. Skinner held that behavior was repeated only when reinforced externally. The ethologists held that behavior resulted from fixed action patterns determined by our genes, and the behaviorist followers of Clark Hull held that we were goaded into action by the need to reduce drives and satisfy biological needs.</p>
<p class="indent">Starting around 1965, the favored explanations began to change radically. A person’s environment was considered less and less important in causing his behavior. Four different lines of thought converged on the proposition that self-direction, rather than outside forces, could explain human action.</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li><a id="c01-nts1a"/>In 1959, Noam Chomsky wrote a devastating critique of B. F. Skinner’s seminal book <em>Verbal Behavior</em>. Chomsky argued that language in particular and human action in general were not the result of strengthening past verbal habits by reinforcement. The essence of language, he said, is that it is generative: Sentences never said or heard before (such as “There’s a purple Gila monster sitting on your lap”) could nevertheless be understood immediately.</li>
<li>Jean Piaget, the great Swiss investigator of how children develop, had persuaded most of the world—the Americans last—that the unfolding mind of the individual child could be scientifically studied.</li>
<li>In 1967, with the publication of Ulric Neisser’s <em>Cognitive Psychology</em>, a new field captured the imagination of the young experimental psychologists fleeing the dogmas of behaviorism. Cognitive psychology argued that the workings of the human mind could be measured and their consequences studied by using the information-processing activities of computers as a model.</li>
<li>Behavioral psychologists found that animal and human behavior was inadequately explained by drives and needs and began to invoke the cognitions—the thoughts—of the individual to explain complex behavior.</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">So the dominant theories in psychology shifted focus in the late 1960s from the power of the environment to individual expectation, preference, choice, decision, control, and helplessness.</p>
<p class="indent">This fundamental change in the field of psychology is intimately related to a fundamental change in our own psychology. For the first time in history—because of technology and mass production and distribution, and for other reasons—large numbers of people are able to have a significant <a id="page10"/>measure of choice and therefore of personal control over their lives. Not the least of these choices concerns our own habits of thinking. By and large, people have welcomed that control. We belong to a society that grants to its individual members powers they have never had before, a society that takes individuals’ pleasures and pains very seriously, that exalts the self and deems personal fulfillment a legitimate goal, an almost sacred right.</p>
<h2 class="section" id="c01-s02">Depression</h2>
<p class="nonindent"><a id="c01-nts2a"/>W<span class="small">ITH THESE FREEDOMS</span> have come perils. For the age of the self is also the age of that phenomenon so closely linked to pessimism: depression, the ultimate expression of pessimism. We are in the middle of an epidemic of depression, one with consequences that, through suicide, takes as many lives as the AIDS epidemic and is more widespread. Severe depression is ten times more prevalent today than it was fifty years ago. It assaults women twice as often as men, and it now strikes a full decade earlier in life on average than it did a generation ago.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="c01-nts3a"/>Until recently there were only two accepted ways of thinking about depression: the psychoanalytic and the biomedical. The psychoanalytic view is based on a paper that Sigmund Freud wrote almost seventy-five years ago. Freud’s speculations were built on very little observation and a very free use of imagination. He claimed that depression was anger turned against the self: The depressive disparages himself as worthless and wants to kill himself. The depressive, said Freud, learns to hate himself at his mother’s knee. One day early in the child’s life, the mother inevitably abandons the child, at least as the child sees it. (She goes off on vacation or stays out too late or has another child.) In some children this produces rage, but because the mother is too beloved to be the target of rage, the child turns it upon a more acceptable target—himself (or, more precisely, that part of himself that identifies with his mother). This becomes a destructive habit. Now, whenever abandonment strikes again, he rages against himself rather than against the real perpetrator of the current loss. Self-loathing, depression as a reaction to loss, suicide—all follow neatly.</p>
<p class="indent">In Freud’s view, you do not get rid of depression easily. Depression is a product of childhood conflicts that remain unresolved beneath frozen layers of defense. Only by breaking through those layers, Freud believed, and eventually resolving the ancient conflicts, can the tendency to depression wane. Year after year of psychoanalysis—the therapist-guided struggle <a id="page11"/>to gain insight into the childhood origins of turning rage upon the self—is Freud’s prescription for depression.</p>
<p class="indent">For all its hold over the American (particularly the Manhattan) imagination, I have to say that this view is preposterous. It dooms its victim to years of one-way conversation about the murky, distant past in order to overcome a problem that usually would have gone away by itself in a matter of months. In more than 90 percent of cases, depression is episodic: It comes and then it goes. The episodes last between three and twelve months. Although many thousands of patients have had hundreds of thousands of sessions, psychoanalytic therapy has not been demonstrated to work for depression.</p>
<p class="indent">Worse, it blames the victim. Psychoanalytic theory argues that because of character flaws, the victim brings depression upon himself. He <em>wants</em> to be depressed. He is motivated by the drive for self-punishment to spend endless days in misery, and to do away with himself if he can.</p>
<p class="indent">I do not mean this critique as a general indictment of Freudian thinking. Freud was a great liberator. In his early work on hysteria—physical losses like paralysis with no physical cause—he dared to examine human sexuality and confront its darker aspects. However, his success in using the underside of sexuality to explain hysteria gave rise to a formula he used for the rest of his life. All mental suffering became a transmutation of some vile part of us, and to Freud the vile parts were us at our most basic and universal. This implausible premise, insulting as it is to human nature, began an epoch in which anything can be said:</p>
<div class="block">
<p class="bl_hanging">You want to have sex with your mother.</p>
<p class="bl_hanging">You want to kill your father.</p>
<p class="bl_hanging">You harbor fantasies that your newborn baby might die—because you want him to die.</p>
<p class="bl_hanging">You want to spend your days in endless misery.</p>
<p class="bl_hanging">Your most loathsome, inner secrets are what is most basic to you.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Used in this manner, words lose their connection with reality; they become detached from emotion and from the common, recognized experience of mankind. Try saying any of these things to an armed Sicilian.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="c01-nts4a"/>The other, more acceptable view of depression is biomedical. Depression, say the biological psychiatrists, is an illness of the body. It comes from an inherited biochemical defect—sited, perhaps, on an arm of chromosome number 11—that produces an imbalance of brain chemicals. Biological psychiatrists treat depression with drugs or electroconvulsive <a id="page12"/>therapy (“shock treatment”). These are quick, inexpensive, and moderately effective remedies.</p>
<p class="indent">The biomedical view, unlike the psychoanalytic, is partly right. Some depressions seem to be the result of a poorly functioning brain, and to some extent they are inherited. Many depressions will respond (sluggishly) to antidepressant drugs and (briskly) to electroconvulsive therapy. But these victories are only partial and are a mixed blessing. Antidepressant drugs and high electrical current passing through the brain can have nasty side effects, which a large minority of depressed people cannot tolerate. Further, the biomedical view glibly generalizes from the small number of hard-core, inherited depressions that usually respond to drugs to the much more common, everyday depressions that afflict so many lives. A very considerable proportion of depressed people have not inherited depression from their parents, and there is no evidence that milder depression can be relieved by taking drugs.</p>
<p class="indent">Worst of all, the biomedical approach makes patients out of essentially normal people and makes them dependent on outside forces—pills dispensed by a benevolent physician. Antidepressant drugs are not addicting in the usual sense; the patient does not crave them when they are withdrawn. Rather, when the successfully treated patient stops taking his drugs, the depression often returns. The effectively drugged patient cannot credit himself for carving out his happiness and his ability to function with a semblance of normality; he must credit the pills. The antidepressant drugs are as good an example of our overmedicated society as the use of tranquilizers to bring peace of mind or hallucinogens to see beauty. In each case, emotional problems that could be solved by one’s own skills and actions are turned over to an outside agent for solution.</p>
<p class="extract">W<span class="small">HAT IF</span> the great majority of depressions are much simpler than the biological psychiatrists and the psychoanalysts believe?</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>What if depression is not something you are motivated to bring upon yourself but something that just descends upon you?</li>
<li>What if depression is not an illness but a severe low mood?</li>
<li>What if you are not a prisoner of past conflicts in the way you react?</li>
<li>What if depression is in fact set off by present troubles?</li>
<li>What if you are not a prisoner of your genes or your brain chemistry, either?</li>
<li>What if depression arises from mistaken inferences we make from <a id="page13"/>the tragedies and setbacks we all experience over the course of a life?</li>
<li>What if depression occurs merely when we harbor pessimistic beliefs about the causes of our setbacks?</li>
<li>What if we can unlearn pessimism and acquire the skills of looking at setbacks optimistically?</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="section" id="c01-s03">Achievement</h2>
<p class="nonindent">T<span class="small">HE TRADITIONAL VIEW</span> of achievement, like the traditional view of depression, needs overhauling. Our workplaces and our schools operate on the conventional assumption that success results from a combination of talent and desire. When failure occurs, it is because either talent or desire is missing. But failure also can occur when talent and desire are present in abundance but optimism is missing.</p>
<p class="indent">From nursery school on, there are frequent tests of talent—IQ tests, SATs, MCATs, and so on—tests that many parents consider so important to their child’s future that they pay to have the child instructed in the art of taking them. At every stage in life, these tests allegedly separate the competent from the less competent. While talent has proved to be roughly measurable, it has turned out to be depressingly hard to increase. Cram courses for SATs can raise pupils’ scores somewhat; they leave untouched the true level of talent.</p>
<p class="indent">Desire is another matter; it can be boosted all too easily. Preachers inflame desire for salvation to white-hot in an hour or two. Clever advertising creates desire in a moment where none existed before. Seminars can hike motivation and leave employees pumped-up and exuberant. Yet all these ardors are ephemeral. Burning desire for salvation wanes without constant fanning; the fancy for one product is forgotten in minutes or is replaced by a new fancy. Pumping-up seminars work for a few days or weeks, then more pumping up is needed.</p>
<p class="extract">B<span class="small">UT WHAT IF</span> the traditional view of the components of success is wrong?</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>What if there is a third factor—optimism or pessimism—that matters as much as talent or desire?</li>
<li>What if you can have all the talent and desire necessary—yet, if you are a pessimist, still fail?</li>
<li><a id="page14"/>What if optimists do better at school, at work, and on the playing field?</li>
<li>What if optimism is a learned skill, one that can be <em>permanently</em> acquired?</li>
<li>What if we can instill this skill in our children?</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="section" id="c01-s04">Health</h2>
<p class="nonindent">T<span class="small">HE TRADITIONAL VIEW</span> of health turns out to be as flawed as the traditional view of talent. Optimism and pessimism affect health itself, almost as clearly as do physical factors.</p>
<p class="indent">Most people assume that physical health is a wholly physical matter and that it is determined by constitution, health habits, and how completely you avoid germs. They believe that for the most part your constitution is the result of your genes, although you can enhance it with the right eating habits, with vigorous exercise, by avoiding cholesterol of the bad sort, by having regular checkups, by wearing seat belts. You can avoid illness by inoculation, rigorous hygiene, safe sex, staying away from people with colds, brushing your teeth three times a day, and the like. When someone’s health fails, therefore, it must be because he had a weak constitution, had poor health habits, or came across too many germs.</p>
<p class="indent">This conventional view omits a major determinant of health—our own cognitions. Our physical health is something over which we can have far greater personal control than we probably suspect. For example:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>The way we think, especially about health, changes our health.</li>
<li>Optimists catch fewer infectious diseases than pessimists do.</li>
<li>Optimists have better health habits than pessimists do.</li>
<li>Our immune system may work better when we are optimistic.</li>
<li>Evidence suggests that optimists live longer than pessimists.</li>
</ul>
<p class="extract">D<span class="small">EPRESSION</span>, achievement, and physical health are three of the most obvious applications of learned optimism. But there is also the potential for a new understanding of yourself.</p>
<p class="indent">By the end of this book, you will know how pessimistic or optimistic you are, and you will be able to measure your spouse’s and children’s optimism, if you wish. You will even be able to measure how pessimistic you used to be. You will know much more about why you get depressed—suffer <a id="page15"/>from the blues or fall into really serious despair—and what maintains your depression. You will understand more about the times you have failed although you had the talent and desired the goal very much. You will also have learned a new set of skills to stop depression and prevent its return. You can choose to use these skills when you need them to help in your daily life. Evidence is now accumulating that they will improve your health. Further, you’ll be able to share these skills with people you care about.</p>
<p class="indent">Most significantly, you will also gain an understanding of the new science of personal control.</p>
<p class="indent">Learned optimism is not a rediscovery of the “power of positive thinking.” The skills of optimism do not emerge from the pink Sunday-school world of happy events. They do not consist in learning to say positive things to yourself. We have found over the years that positive statements you make to yourself have little if any effect. What <em>is</em> crucial is what you think when you fail, using the power of “non-negative thinking.” Changing the destructive things you say to yourself when you experience the setbacks that life deals all of us is the central skill of optimism.</p>
<p class="extract">M<span class="small">OST PSYCHOLOGISTS</span> spend their lives working within traditional categories of problems: depression, achievement, health, political upsets, parenting, business organizations, and the like. I have spent my life trying to create a new category, which cuts across many of the traditional ones. I see events as successes or failures of personal control.</p>
<p class="indent">Viewing things this way makes the world look quite different. Take an apparently unrelated collection of events: depression and suicide becoming commonplace; a society elevating personal fulfillment to a right; the race going not to the swift but to the self-confident; people suffering chronic illness frighteningly early in life and dying before their time; intelligent, devoted parents producing fragile, spoiled children; a therapy curing depression just by changing conscious thinking. Where others would see this mélange of success and failure, suffering and triumph, as absurd and puzzling, I see it as all of a piece. This book, for better or worse, follows my lines of sight.</p>
<p class="indent">We begin with the theory of personal control. I will introduce to you two principal concepts: learned helplessness and explanatory style. They are intimately related.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Learned helplessness</em> is the giving-up reaction, the quitting response that follows from the belief that whatever you do doesn’t matter. <em>Explanatory style</em> is the manner in which you habitually explain to yourself why events happen. It is the great modulator of learned helplessness. An optimistic <a id="page16"/>explanatory style stops helplessness, whereas a pessimistic explanatory style spreads helplessness. Your way of explaining events to yourself determines how helpless you can become, or how energized, when you encounter the everyday setbacks as well as momentous defeats. I think of your explanatory style as reflecting “the word in your heart.”</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="c01-nts5a"/>Each of us carries a word in his heart, a “no” or a “yes.” You probably don’t know intuitively which word lives there, but you can learn, with a fair degree of accuracy, which it is. Soon you will test yourself and discover your own level of optimism or pessimism.</p>
<p class="indent">Optimism has an important place in some, though not all, realms of your life. It is not a panacea. But it can protect you against depression; it can raise your level of achievement; it can enhance your physical well-being; it is a far more pleasant mental state to be in. Pessimism, on the other hand, also has its proper place, and you will find out more about its redeeming aspect later in the book.</p>
<p class="indent">If the tests indicate that you are a pessimist, that’s not the end of the matter. Unlike many personal qualities, basic pessimism is not fixed and unchangeable. You can learn a set of skills that free you from the tyranny of pessimism and allow you to use optimism when you choose. These skills are not mindlessly simple to acquire, but they can be mastered. The first step is to discover the word in your heart. Not coincidentally, that is also the initial step toward a new understanding of the human mind, one that has unfolded over the past quarter-century—an understanding of how an individual’s sense of personal control determines his fate.</p>

<p class="footnote11" id="c01-ftn1"><a class="hlink" href="#c01-ftn1a">*</a> Throughout this book, when the pronoun “he” is used, as it is in this sentence, simply to mean a human being, the reader is asked to read it as “he or she.” To use “he or she” in every instance would be awkward and distracting, and at the moment there seems to be no workable alternative, although in due time the ever-vigorous English language will doubtless evolve one.</p>
