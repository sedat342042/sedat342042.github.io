<p class="noindent1"><span class="dropcap">M</span><span class="small-caps">IK CALLED JUST</span> as Eik had rolled down the window and lit a cigarette. Louise pulled over in front of the entrance to the old sawmill.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I have to ask you for a favor,” he started off. “We can’t get Bitten Gamst to cough up the name of her lover but we need to get ahold of him to find out if he saw the rapist in or around the house when he came to visit her.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“So you want me to give it another try?” Louise asked.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“We also need to get her husband to talk and tell us if he knows who drives the white van,” he continued. He added that a couple of his people had caught René that same morning walking around the woods with a loaded shotgun. “Of course he denied looking for the rapist but I don’t want him roaming around out there. And I feel certain that he and his wife are covering for someone who frequents the woods.”</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-231"></a>“Did the forensic officers get anything out of searching the scene?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“There were some pretty nice footprints by the door. Right now we’re working on sorting out which fingerprints belong to the people who usually visit the house so we can exclude them.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“You’re not going to exclude them just like that?” Louise blurted out.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“No, of course not.” Mik told her that Bitten and her husband didn’t appear to have much of a social life. “It’s limited to her mother and two other couples. Those are the only people who have been to the house in the past month.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“And her lover,” Louise added. She promised to see what she could get out of them.</p>
<p class="space-break">“T<span class="small-caps">A-DAH</span>!” C<span class="small-caps">AMILLA EXULTED</span> when she called back a minute later. “You may now call me Mrs. Sachs-Smith.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Congratulations,” Louise said, holding the phone away from her ear a little. “That’s wonderful news. Listen, I want to hear everything, but I’m in the middle of something serious here. I promise to call as soon as I’m done. Enjoy each other—I’m so happy for you.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“We can go by there on our way home and have a toast with them,” Eik suggested, looking quite serious.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise quickly shook her head. “I don’t think they’re at all interested in having company. It seems like they’ve got more than enough in each other,” she said. “And I was actually going to ask if you would mind stopping by my parents’ house and picking up Jonas after we talk to Bitten.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise had given a lot of thought to her meeting with René at the hospital. If he didn’t recognize her when they saw each <a id="page-232"></a>other in the doorway, he had bigger things on his mind. But now that he had had some time to think, something might start to ring a bell. Of course, he might well have known exactly who she was. The whole thing was unsettling, but she’d decided that she would have to ignore whatever may come. That idea had felt sensible then, but now that they were approaching the Starling House, her chest started tightening.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She turned Eik’s massive vehicle into the narrow driveway to the thatched house and pulled the emergency brake.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Does this thing work?” she asked worriedly as the car rolled forward a little.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“It’s not razor-sharp but it works.” He spit out his chewing gum in the tall grass as he got out.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Every door and window of the house was closed; the place was completely quiet, and there was no sign of life. Aside from a car parked right by the road, there was no indication that anybody was home.</p>
<p class="calibre6">They walked together along the uneven stone path to the door at the end of the old forest guard’s house. The small-paned windows were lined up close together all the way along the side of the old farmhouse. Hollyhocks climbed up the white, lime-washed timber frame, their top flowers bending down like swans when they reached the bottom edge of the thatched roof.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise walked over and knocked on a low stable door, which seemed to be the original one, still on the house. It was so low that she would risk bumping her head walking through. On the opposite end of the house was the patio where the hot tub was set up. It faced the closed-off part of the property; a dense thicket of beech marked the division between yard and forest. There was no sign of the forensic officers, who had long finished in the house, except for a small piece of barrier tape used for preventing passage through the area around the patio door.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-233"></a>Louise didn’t hear anyone coming until the door opened, and she instinctively took a step back when she saw Bitten. The slight woman had a large, bluish-black mark around one eye, which was completely swollen shut. She wore a white robe, and her hair was rumpled and flat on one side as if she had lain down with it still wet.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Are you alone?” Louise asked while Eik stayed in the background.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Bitten shook her head a little. “Come in.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“How are you doing?” Louise asked, leaving the door open for Eik while she followed Bitten into the living room, which had been renovated with a floor made from ship’s planks—a remarkably poor decorating choice for the old house. All in all, René and Bitten had a nautical theme going on with both furniture and paintings in shades of blue and green. At one end of the living room, a large, built-in aquarium ran all the way behind the sofa set to the patio door. At least the style was consistent, Louise thought, but it seemed completely out of place in the middle of the forest. There was neither sea nor a harbor nearby. The closest thing to a body of water was Avnsø Lake.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I’m okay,” Bitten answered, her voice like that of a little girl. Louise had enough experience to register that what was missing from her voice was her dignity.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Where’s your husband?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise followed Bitten’s gaze out into the yard. “He’s putting a cross on the dog’s grave.” Bitten sank onto the wide couch, her eyes shiny. “Our daughter insisted.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Mik had told them that they had found the dog in the yard next to the toolshed, its neck broken and upper body crushed. “It wasn’t a pretty sight,” he had added.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“My daughter and I didn’t get to see her, so we haven’t even <a id="page-234"></a>had a chance to say good-bye,” she sniffled. “René buried her this morning and now there’s going to be a cross on there.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise leaned in very close. “Did he hit you again?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">She looked at the woman’s swollen eye. Although swelling always took some time, she would almost swear that it wasn’t the injuries from the day before that made Bitten’s face look like that.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The woman shook her head and clasped her hands while biting her lip.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Then who did it?” Louise pushed. “I can tell that something happened since I last saw you.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">The woman turned her head away without responding.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Damn it, Bitten!” Louise changed tactics. “You have to tell me what’s going on. Who are you having an affair with? We’re going to find him anyway, and you can save us a lot of trouble and yourself a lot of discomfort by telling us.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">A tear rolled down her cheek and she folded her slender hands in front of her mouth, biting her knuckle.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“We might not even have to tell your husband,” Louise finally said, uncomfortable about making that kind of promise.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“He already knows,” Bitten whispered, leaning forward a little while casting a quick, sidelong glance at Louise without turning her head. “When we got home from the hospital, Ole was suddenly at the door. He had seen the police cars and wanted to know what happened earlier that day and whether I had said anything about him.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">She wiped her face.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Ole Thomsen?” Louise whispered even though they were alone in the room. “Please tell me that’s not who you were waiting for?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Bitten twitched and nodded so slightly, it was difficult to see.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“And René knows?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“He does now. He didn’t understand how Ole knew that I’d <a id="page-235"></a>had the day off. I didn’t have time to think of a lie while they were both standing there so I told the truth.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">She swallowed and bent her head, her chin touching her chest.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“What did your husband say?” Louise asked.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Bitten gave a small scoff as she straightened herself up. “What do you think?” she said with sarcasm and looked at Louise while shaking her head, making her short hair fall in front of her ear. “He didn’t say anything; he didn’t dare, just like I knew he wouldn’t. Nobody tells Big Thomsen no. If they do, they lose either their job or their business. Their car gets stolen or their house burns down. And of course he’s never the one who stands to take the fall for it. So you’d be a fool to try to stop him if there’s something he wants.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“And he wanted you,” Louise concluded sympathetically.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Bitten nodded. “I didn’t really have a choice once René started working for him.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“In the woods?” Louise asked.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“No, he’s a driver. He just goes to the woods to laze around. He’s got three trucks on the side; that’s how he makes his money. Two of them carry gravel from the gravel pit—that’s what René does—and the third one carries freight. That’s the one the new guy from Pasture House drives—Thomsen’s cousin.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise took a deep breath. That explained the man’s behavior the other day.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“So what happened once it was just the two of you?” she asked.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“At first he was angry, but I think that was mostly because he was hurt. I guess he thought his friend had enough respect for him to keep his hands to himself, and now he’s running around the woods searching for the rapist, maybe mostly to convince himself that he won’t stand for another man touching his wife.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">In a way it didn’t surprise her, Louise thought. She could just picture Big Thomsen slinking in to see his friend’s wife. <a id="page-236"></a>She imagined him sneaking up in his lumberjack getup, hiding the old Land Cruiser between the trees in order to take the back way through the yard and in between Bitten’s legs.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Come to think of it, she wasn’t sure that Ole Thomsen would even bother to hide his car when he came around to visit. He probably parked right in the driveway.</p>
<p class="calibre6">It was no wonder that René had freaked out. Just then, he appeared at the doorway, having come in from the yard, where Eik was talking with his and Bitten’s young daughter.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Did you find him?” René asked</p>
<p class="calibre6">René Gamst needed a haircut, Louise observed as she moved to an armchair to let him take a seat on the couch next to his wife. He put his arm around Bitten’s shoulder and pulled her close.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I want you to find out who came into my house and raped my wife.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">As he sat there, aggrieved in so many ways, Louise suddenly felt sorry for him. His friend screwed his wife and a stranger had entered his home and done the same. He had been robbed of his dignity and manhood.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I promise we’ll find out,” she said, meaning it.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Please don’t say that unless you really believe it,” he said.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise leaned in a little. “I do. We’ll find him,” she repeated.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“If you don’t, I will.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Please stop it, René,” Bitten pleaded.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise could tell that though he stopped himself from making a pointed reply, he was frustrated and upset. His face red, his eyes shifting back and forth, he pressed his lips together and remained silent.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She leaned back in her chair.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Have either of you seen a white van in the woods or by the Stokkebo Road parking area?” she asked.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-237"></a>Bitten quickly shook her head but looked at René, who averted his eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“You’ve seen it,” Louise concluded. “Who’s the driver?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">His face twitched. He gave a small sniffle and folded his hands but still didn’t answer.</p>
<p class="calibre6">From the corner of her eye, she sensed Bitten straightening up and holding her breath.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise got out the picture of Lise Andersen and placed it on the table. “Do you know anything about this woman?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">They both looked at the photograph, then shook their heads. Eik came back into the house and sat down in the chair next to Louise.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Please. Tell us who drives the white van,” she urged.</p>
<p class="calibre6">But this time René didn’t react. Bitten was no longer holding her breath, but she was still as a mouse.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise got so angry that she jumped out of her chair. She grabbed René by the shoulders and shook him, holding on firmly.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Why the hell should I lift a finger to find out who was in your house when you don’t even want to help?” she yelled.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Looking startled, Bitten had moved all the way to the opposite end of the couch.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise shook him again. “Several women have gone missing, one has been murdered, and your own wife has been raped. Now, you’re going to tell me who drives that van!”</p>
<p class="calibre6">She released her hold on him, letting him drop back down on the couch. She avoided looking at Eik as she walked back to her chair.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“If we can rule out that this person is connected to the ongoing cases, then we can eliminate the van from the equation and stop wasting our time on it,” she said in a more subdued tone of voice.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“It’s Ole,” René finally disclosed.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-238"></a>“Ole Thomsen?” she asked in surprise. “I thought he drove an old Land Cruiser?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Not when he’s selling meat.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Shut your mouth, René!” Bitten shouted angrily and kicked him.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise ignored her, keeping René’s eyes locked. “Meat?” she asked.</p>
<p class="calibre6">He looked down at the table.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Tell me what you know about that van,” she demanded. “It’s been spotted in the woods on several occasions and it might be connected to the attacks that have occurred out there. It was last seen yesterday, driving out from the woods.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“That’s because he was here after I picked up Bitten from the hospital,” René admitted at last. “The woods were crawling with police so he came over here instead to find out what we knew.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Be quiet, René,” Bitten whispered without looking at her husband.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Keep talking,” Louise commanded. “What’s with the meat?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Just that he goes and parks in the parking lot twice a week to sell it.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise shook her head, not understanding what it was all about.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Off the books, for crying out loud,” René blurted out, gesticulating. “Whatever the butcher doesn’t sell in the shop goes out the back door.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“And gets sold off the books,” Eik concluded. René nodded.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Lars Frandsen’s shop,” Louise guessed.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Another one of the guys from the old gang, he had taken over the butcher shop after his dad.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“René, please stop it now!” his wife begged. “We’re not supposed to say anything. You know what will happen. And we’ve never seen it, either.”</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-239"></a>That last part was a lie, Louise thought. She was willing to bet that they bought the cheap meat as well.</p>
<p class="calibre6">René’s eyes wandered. “That was a mistake,” he stammered. “Bitten is right. I don’t know anything.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“But you know that Big Thomsen drives the van?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">He had started sweating, and his eyes were suddenly frightened as he turned toward them.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Please don’t tell him what I said,” he pleaded. “It was a mistake.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Bitten sat behind him, curling herself up while she kept shaking her head.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise shrugged. It was sad to see the degree to which they were subjected to the hierarchy that had been built up while they were still in school. She could hardly believe that this kind of thing could last all the way into adulthood. It had to be more than friendship tying that gang together, she thought as she got up.</p>
<p class="calibre6">René and Bitten stayed seated and watched them leave when they offered to show themselves out.</p>
<p class="space-break">“T<span class="small-caps">HAT WAS HOT</span>!” Eik said approvingly as they walked toward the car. “I like it when you get mad.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Shut up,” she snapped, getting into the car. The couple were genuinely scared senseless at the thought that they were the ones to reveal that Ole Thomsen and Frandsen the butcher were doing business under the table together.</p>
<p class="calibre6">They were driving down the forest road toward Lerbjerg when Louise suggested that she had better call Mik and tell him to check up on Big Thomsen.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“So that’s why nobody knows anything about that van,” she said. “He’s got everyone under his thumb so they won’t say anything that might provoke him. I never understood how he <a id="page-240"></a>managed to build up that position. It seems like he’s got something on everyone so they have to yield to him.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">She shook her head and got her cell phone from her bag.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Could he be our guy?” Eik asked as they drove through the last intersection before Lerbjerg. “He was around the area in 1991 as well.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Then it had to be Big Thomsen who raped Bitten, even though she was there waiting for him,” Louise said, but then she nodded a second later. “It’s not impossible, I guess. He’s clearly in touch with his inner primitive beast.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise had to go through the switchboard before being transferred to Mik and she briefly regretted not opting to call his cell phone. She still had his number on speed dial.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Mik Rasmussen,” he answered, sounding rushed.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Ole Thomsen is the one who drives the white van,” she began. “He’s also Bitten’s lover so it’s a double bonus. The vehicle may be registered under the name of Lars Frandsen, the butcher.” She told him about the illegal meat sales.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“We’ve already spoken with the butcher. It’s his car but he flatout denies that it’s been in the woods. He says it’s a company car.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise sighed. <em class="calibre5">Cocky as always</em>, she thought.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Ole Thomsen is the driver. So he’s the one you need to talk to, and he needs to be busted for the meat thing along with Frandsen.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">She nodded to Eik, who signaled that he wanted to get out of the car. They had pulled into her parents’ courtyard.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“We’ve already got our sights on him,” Mik said. “It appears that he’s been sleeping his way through half of central Zealand. At least his alibis for the times that we’re interested in were provided by several different women. But I’m not buying those stories. Something is very wrong here.”</p>
