<p class="noindent1"><span class="dropcap">H</span><span class="small-caps">E WAS SWEATING</span>, his thin hair sticking to his forehead, and his lumberjack shirt had come untucked. For a minute he stood transfixed, staring through the bars into the empty pen. Then he turned his gaze toward Louise, and his eyes lit up as he held out his hand.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Jørgen,” she said, her back against the pen.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She only took one step sideways before she felt his hands on her face. He ran his fingers down her cheeks. She pressed her arm against her body and felt her shoulder holster but didn’t have a chance to react when he suddenly grabbed her and pulled her toward him.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Jørgen. Let me go,” she demanded angrily and tried to wrench free of him but he brutally tightened his grip and she lost her breath. When she made another attempt, he squeezed her so hard that an intense pain shot behind her left lung as a couple of her ribs cracked.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-300"></a>Louise gasped for breath as he pushed her farther down the barn corridor, his one arm still locked around her. Yet she still tried to resist when he pulled off her sweater and yanked the gun holster over her head, the sharp leather straps cutting into her skin.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre5">Don’t fight back</em>, she suddenly thought, remembering Bodil’s words.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She registered a new sound behind her—footsteps on the concrete floors. She wanted to turn her head but fell against the wall when Jørgen tore her blouse and pulled it off her, panting and snorting. With a single jerk, he tore her bra and started roughly fondling her breasts.</p>
<p class="calibre6">It hurt. His hands were rough against her skin. Louise closed her eyes, unable to look at his face. She felt his heavy breathing very close to her neck and then against her cheek as he stuffed a piece of her torn blouse into her mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Using his entire body weight, he pressed her forward until she was doubled over across the saddle rack. The old grain sacks, heavy with dust, scratched her face as he pushed both hands down inside the waistband of her jeans to pull them down. The grit on the barn corridor crunched beneath her feet as he tugged on her pants one more time so the button fell off, enabling him to shove them all the way down.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The steps behind her came closer. Louise lifted her head to see the barn door and the twilight hitting the corridor from the doorway. At first she could only make out the outline of a person behind Jørgen’s broad body but as it came closer, she recognized René Gamst standing there holding his shotgun.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Relief rushed through her as they made eye contact, but then he moved his eyes to her exposed lower body and Louise noticed the bulge in his pants.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Jørgen was right behind her. She could feel the fabric of his <a id="page-301"></a>pants against her naked buttocks. The pain was burning in her chest, and her breathing was wheezy. His breath was like hard blows as she heard him undo his zipper. Louise closed her eyes and looked away from the barn door.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Then the first shot fell, and Jørgen’s body jerked violently. Another shot followed a second later.</p>
<p class="space-break">L<span class="small-caps">OUISE FELT THE</span> warmth spreading across her naked torso as the blood from Jørgen’s torn veins pumped onto her skin, and he slumped over heavily on top of her.</p>
<p class="calibre6">As his grasp around her slackened, she grabbed onto the end of the saddle rack and started pulling herself out from beneath the weight of his large body. She gasped for breath as a bloody splodge from his head landed on her shoulder.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She tumbled into the corridor and pulled up her jeans while Jørgen’s body was left slumped, his arms dangling limply over the floor. Louise breathed in sharp blows after pulling the rag out of her mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre6">René was still holding the gun with both hands.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“You could have hit me,” she whispered, covering her breasts with what was left of her blouse.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“That was a risk I was willing to take.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">She watched a speck of dust floating in the light from the window and heard the sound of Jørgen’s blood dripping onto the floor.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Why didn’t you shoot him right away?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">She couldn’t bear to look at him while asking.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Because you liked it,” he answered scornfully. “If only Klaus could have seen how little you fought it.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I’ll kill you,” Louise snarled at him, her heart starting to pound. She could feel her pulse beating in her neck, and her <a id="page-302"></a>chest getting tight. He had recognized her after all. Determined not to lose control entirely, she breathed in and out, dug her nails into her palm, and stared directly into his eyes. “Leave Klaus out of this,” she said through her teeth. “No wonder he didn’t want to hang out with you guys anymore.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“You!” he snorted. “You don’t understand a damn thing. You never did, not now and not then.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“What do you mean?” Louise asked him, straightening up so the pain from her broken ribs stabbed inside her chest.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Thomsen was right. You were so gullible.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Despite her agonizing pain, she got up before he had a chance to react, kicked the weapon out of his hands, and twisted his arm around so hard that he doubled over.</p>
<p class="calibre6">René Gamst moaned.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Tell me what happened!” she yelled, pulling on his arm.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Your boyfriend was a pussy,” he gasped. “He didn’t have the fucking guts to put the noose around his own neck.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">His words made everything go black as she pushed him down the barn corridor in an armlock. She pressed him against the ground as she bent down, pulling out two plastic strips from her shoulder holster on the floor.</p>
<p class="calibre6">He screamed when she tightened one of them around his hands before using the other strip to fasten his wrist to a bar in front of the horse pen. Then she left the barn without looking back just as the door to the main house swung open and the female officer came running out.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Did you hear the shots?” she shouted. “It was right nearby. I called Mik. They’re on their—”</p>
<p class="calibre6">She stopped abruptly as if she only just then really noticed Louise.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“What…?” she exclaimed, stunned, and walked toward her.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise brushed her aside and crumpled up in the small <a id="page-303"></a>pebbles. She pulled her shirt together around her naked chest and leaned back against the black-tarred plinth before closing her eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She heard René calling from the barn and soon after the sound of running steps approaching. Someone stopped next to her but she didn’t open her eyes, and then she heard him continue into the barn. He returned a minute later and fell to his knees next to her. When he said her name, she recognized Mik’s voice.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I think he broke a couple of my ribs,” she said quietly and opened her eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Others came running as well. Louise registered that the female runner had been found not far from there. She was alive but in bad shape. Nobody mentioned the baby in her belly. More footsteps and more voices but she couldn’t take part in it. Ambulances had been called, and someone put a blanket around her.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Eik was wheezing as he stumbled into the courtyard, out of breath. With a cry of shock, he dropped down on the rocks next to her, reaching his hand out for her soiled face.</p>
<p class="space-break">E<span class="small-caps">IK WAS STILL</span> sitting there when two ambulances pulled into the courtyard. She could smell his leather jacket and hear him breathing but she couldn’t see him.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Someone reached a hand down to her and she managed to get up while pain shot through her entire body. She slowly shook her head when he asked if she wanted him to ride along.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“When you head out together, you go home together,” he tried.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Not today,” she mumbled, pulling the blanket closer around her body as she walked to the ambulance.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-304"></a>Over by the barn René was about to be put into the backseat of a police car. Louise turned her eyes away quickly but not quickly enough to avoid his scornful look and the twitching at the corner of his mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She nodded when the ambulance driver asked if she would prefer to lie down. He asked about her condition and where it hurt but by then Louise had already turned her face away and closed her eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She heard the police car drive off with René before they closed the back of the ambulance. She could feel his eyes on her naked body again before the shot was fired. She had thought he would help her. But in that gang, they only helped each other.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The potholes in the gravel road made the first-aid kit in the back of the ambulance rattle as they drove away.</p>
