<p class="noindent1"><span class="dropcap">B</span><span class="small-caps">UT LINGER IT</span> did. The following morning, Jonas woke up with shiny eyes, his skin burning up with fever. Louise called Hanne to let her know that she would be late because she had to put Jonas on a train to Hvalsø, where her parents could pick him up at the station.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“You’ll probably need to have someone else take care of that,” Hanne cut in curtly. “Attendance at the monthly managers’ meeting is mandatory, and it starts in twenty minutes—which you would have known if you had been here yesterday when I handed out the agenda.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Hanne raised her voice a little before playing her trump card:</p>
<p class="calibre6">“And I personally put it on your desk.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I can’t be there in twenty minutes,” Louise answered quickly, not even bothering to comment on the fact that she had not been informed about these monthly managers’ meetings, either.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-146"></a>“You’ll have to pass on that message to the national commissioner yourself,” Hanne cut in. “That’s not part of my job description.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Don’t even worry about it,” Louise snapped, straining to contain her anger. Right now she didn’t give a damn about Hanne or the national commissioner.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“The meeting runs until noon and after that there’s lunch at Restaurant Posten as usual, and I already ordered for you.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Then you’ll have to cancel the order or send Eik in my place,” Louise hissed and hung up. She was no longer in a hurry to get to the Rathole and decided that she would drive Jonas to Lerbjerg herself. Then he wouldn’t have to rattle around on the train with a fever.</p>
<p class="space-break">L<span class="small-caps">OUISE HAD JUST</span> seen off her parents and their grandson when Mik called to tell her that the Forensics Department had run the test results from the body of the child care provider through the system.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“No match,” he sighed, sounding as tired as he had looked when they ran into each other in the woods. “So now we’ll have to go searching.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">They had performed an autopsy on the child care provider, and the medical examiner had noted indications that she had put up a hard struggle.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Large tufts of her hair had been ripped from her head and she had several pronounced hematomas. It seems so brutal that it got me thinking that maybe there was more than one attacker?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Did they find semen from anyone else?” she asked with interest.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“No,” Mik admitted. “Just from one person, but I find it confusing considering the amount of violence inflicted.”</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-147"></a>“What about the runner; has she turned up?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise had seen neither the news nor the papers since she left the investigation in the woods. It suddenly occurred to her that she hadn’t even spoken with Eik. She was well aware that she owed him an explanation for her absence and an apology for making him attend the meeting this morning.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“No,” Mik exclaimed, clearly frustrated. “The forensic officers have combed her regular route and there’s indication that she was attacked a couple hundred yards before the Troll’s Oak, down by the Deep where the road turns,” he explained. “Do you know the place?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Yes,” Louise mumbled, picturing the road with its steep descent and how you had to stand up and pedal hard to make it back up the hill. Tall pines lined both sides of the road, throwing the wooded area into shade. Someone must have told Mik that they called it the Deep, she thought.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“They found her iPod down there, and bloodstains at the spot, which of course need to be checked for DNA. The ground was torn up from resisting feet,” he continued and quickly added: “The forensic officers think she may have dug her heels in and been dragged away from the road. Unfortunately, the tracks weren’t deep enough to make imprints from the shoe prints. And there’s nothing else to indicate that a crime may have occurred because no one has seen her or heard anything.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Not even the people who live in Starling House?” Louise asked. “It’s not far from there.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Back when she lived out there, an old lady owned the small house in the middle of the woods. It wasn’t far from the gamekeeper’s house; in fact, it was right between that and Verner Post at the Snipe House. When she and her brother were kids, they used to call it the Gingerbread House. They were convinced <a id="page-148"></a>that the old lady was a witch because she never left the house, so they imagined that she lived off the children who played in the woods.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Later on, Louise’s father told her that the old woman suffered from sclerosis and couldn’t get around much the last several years. She used to get her groceries delivered from the store in Hvalsø. So it wasn’t that much of a mystery after all, Louise thought. By now the woman had been dead for several years and the house had been thoroughly renovated.</p>
<p class="calibre6">There was nobody home at Starling House when she and Eik stopped by on their tour of the houses around the woods. Louise had noted that a large patio had been added in the back with an outdoor hot tub. A motorcycle was parked in an open shed, too, so clearly someone had taken over the place.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“No,” Mik replied. “The wife out there was home and drinking coffee on the back porch when her husband left for work around eight, but she didn’t hear anything. But of course by then it may have already happened.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">There was silence at the other end of the line for a moment, then he cleared his throat.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“So in other words: We’ve got nothing. So we have to hurry up and find out whose DNA we’ve got from the blood. We just sent out a press release asking for the public’s assistance in finding any people who regularly visit the woods. Then we’ll have to see if they’ve noticed anything. It’s obviously going to scare them, but I don’t think we have a choice. As long as the perpetrator is out there, we have to do everything we can to catch him and warn others against walking around alone.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise heard his other phone ringing and barely had a chance to say good-bye before he hung up.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She called her mother. She could easily have turned around <a id="page-149"></a>and driven the short distance back to her parents’ three-winged farm but then she would have to go inside again and she just didn’t feel up to it.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Don’t go out in the woods,” she warned when her mother picked up the phone. “I don’t know what you’ve heard but it seems that there are now two victims and they have no lead on the perpetrator.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Sure, but isn’t that overreacting a bit?” her mom said, a smile in her voice.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I don’t know about that,” Louise replied. “The police are sending out a press release warning women against walking alone in the woods. I just thought I should let you know.” She hung up, wondering why she always felt the need to sound so surly when her mother was merely trying to calm a worry.</p>
<p class="calibre6">For a moment she closed her eyes, leaned her head back, and tried to collect herself. She needed to get out of here. The door to her past had been opened and she was unable to control her thoughts so close to where it all happened.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She had put so much energy into denying and rejecting the parts of her past that were too painful to remember that it had never occurred to her how easily they could be roused. She considered, very objectively, what her options were for moving on. To her dismay, there were only two: She either had to hand the case over to Eik, or stuff all her feelings and get on with it. The first would be the ultimate admission of failure, and against everything she stood for. So as she reached Hvalsø and turned right at the roundabout as usual in order to avoid Main Street, Louise realized that she had only one choice.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She drove past the pharmacy and the old stadium, which had given way to a row of town houses. That’s where she used to play handball. She thought of Morits, their coach back then, <a id="page-150"></a>and Arvid, who was the stadium manager and ran the concession stand.</p>
<p class="calibre6">This was where she lived her life. The memories came rushing in, but it all happened so long ago and she had done everything in her power to distance herself from her youth. Maybe that was a mistake. Maybe that was why it hit her so hard now. Because after all, a lot of it had been good. She had kissed in this town, gotten drunk, and gone to plenty of parties.</p>
<p class="calibre6">But she did all of those things with Klaus.</p>
<p class="space-break">T<span class="small-caps">HEY STARTED GOING</span> out when Louise was a freshman. She didn’t have to strain to picture his face, his chestnut-brown hair and grayish-blue eyes, which were always warm even though he wore a leather jacket and tried to look tough.</p>
<p class="calibre6">He had been one grade ahead of her through her school years in Hvalsø, and she’d had a secret crush on him since the seventh grade—so much so that she didn’t even notice the other boys who tried to catch her attention. And her heart was about to break when he left school after sophomore year to become a butcher in Roskilde because she felt certain that once he went there, he would forget all about her.</p>
<p class="calibre6">But he didn’t. He faithfully held on, always asking if she wanted to come along whenever he made plans to go out.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She lost her virginity to Klaus. There had been a bonfire out by Avnsø Lake that evening. They rode their bikes home through the woods, and the next morning she lay in bed with her eyes closed for a long time, trying to determine if she felt different somehow; if maybe she was more grown-up or loved him deeper. And it was probably a little of both.</p>
<p class="calibre6">It wasn’t until he got an apprenticeship in Tølløse that he started hanging out with Big Thomsen and his crowd. Klaus <a id="page-151"></a>was still the same person, but Louise didn’t care for the rest of them. They made her feel insecure because she was never sure if they were serious or just playing crude jokes. As she recalled, they always took it right to the line and sometimes they pushed their followers over it. Luckily Klaus didn’t adopt the same superior attitude or their relationship would have been over.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise wondered what the gang thought of her. She had never really mingled with the group—she mostly stayed with Klaus when there was a party, and otherwise they usually stayed in, spending time in her room or his, unless they were hanging out at the stadium. They got engaged on her eighteenth birthday. He had bought two thin silver rings from the jeweler on Main Street and surprised her when they retired to her bedroom after dinner with her parents.</p>
<p class="calibre6">When his apprenticeship ended, he was able to continue working for the butcher in Tølløse. One evening they had been sitting by Avnsø Lake, thinking about moving in together. As she recalled, it wasn’t much more than a month later that Klaus stopped by one afternoon to tell her about the farmhouse in Kisserup. The rent was just 1,625 kroner a month.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The house was vacant when they went to see it, and Louise loved it even though it needed cleaning and paint. An elderly man had lived there for the past several years before going to a nursing home. Later that same day, after signing the lease, they sat on the lawn beneath the large heritage apple tree, dreaming and making plans for the future. She had shaken her head at Klaus when he pointed out that the two smaller bedrooms behind the living room would make good nurseries.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Her only concern was whether Big Thomsen and his gang planned on moving in as well. It was always a great draw when someone got their own place; friends no longer had to hang out at their parents’ house and be careful to keep the volume down. <a id="page-152"></a>As they sat there in the grass, she had told Klaus that of course he could keep seeing them. She just didn’t want to live with them.</p>
<p class="space-break">W<span class="small-caps">ITHOUT GIVING IT</span> much thought, Louise signaled and turned off toward Kisserup and drove past the gravel pit with a knot slowly growing in her stomach. She hadn’t been there since that summer. There were more houses now, she noted, slowing down a little. The road to the thicket by the house was just after a row of closely spaced trees, which all but obscured the small sign.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The house was at the end of the road. Louise’s palms felt sweaty against the steering wheel as she pulled over and decided to walk the last part of the way. There weren’t many houses along the narrow road, and theirs had been a bit farther down than the rest. The trees still hid the house from view like they did back then; it wasn’t visible from the road, which turned slightly just before the sloped driveway.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise walked along a row of tall trees that followed the field next to the property. She could hear voices. It sounded like children playing with water, whooping and cheering when they got splashed.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She felt cold inside as she stepped between the pines and pushed through the close branches.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The red timber-frame house had a new thatched roof; a large patio had been built in the back. Toys were scattered across the yard and two children squealed with delight as their father turned the water hose in their direction.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise slumped down, staying hidden behind the heavy bottom branches of a pine tree. The remains of breakfast were still on the table and a woman sat under a sunshade, nursing an <a id="page-153"></a>infant. The family was probably enjoying their parental leave with their newest addition.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise noticed that they had planted small bushes in the spot where she had planned to put an apple tree. It would have grown big by now, she thought.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She didn’t cry as she sat there, breaking inside. It was no longer the kind of sorrow that brought tears. It had settled in a deeper place, and she realized that it had eaten away a bit of her life—or at least the life she had dreamed of having.</p>
<p class="space-break">T<span class="small-caps">HEY HAD MOVED</span> in on a Friday, having spent the previous weeks out there painting. Louise’s mother had helped them clean the house, and Klaus borrowed a van from his boss to move their things. They had spent their first night in the house on the living room floor because Klaus had started to unbutton her blouse and then they never really got any farther. At one point during the night, he had dragged in a mattress for them to lie on but they didn’t get much sleep. The way she remembered it, they made love until morning.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The following evening she had made plans with Camilla to spend the night at her studio apartment in Roskilde. A rock band was playing at the high school in Himmelev, and Klaus would never let her drag him along to something like that. So she left him with the boxes to unpack and promised to be back Sunday before noon so they could finish settling in.</p>
<p class="space-break">T<span class="small-caps">HE MOTHER WITH</span> the infant stood up. The baby appeared to be sleeping.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise watched as she gently laid the little one down in the carry-cot next to her chair before going inside. She returned <a id="page-154"></a>shortly after with a couple of towels, which she tossed to the two older children. The father had begun rolling up the water hose. The scene of domestic idyll played on as Louise thought back to the day that hers ended.</p>
<p class="space-break">S<span class="small-caps">HE HAD RIDDEN</span> her bike home from the train station on Sunday morning. She didn’t want to call and wake up Klaus to let him know that she was on her way, but she brought freshly baked bread from the bakery on Main Street—both breakfast rolls and pastries.</p>
<p class="calibre6">His motorcycle was parked in front of the house and the living room windows were open so she thought he might have gotten up early to start unpacking.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The door was unlocked but she didn’t take any time to puzzle over it. She was so excited to see him, she just walked right in.</p>
<p class="calibre6">He was hanging from a rope over the stairs.</p>
<p class="space-break">L<span class="small-caps">OUISE CLOSED HER</span> eyes but stood up quickly before the images got too clear. With her arms in front of her, she pushed her way back through the pines and stumbled out into the road.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She froze for a second. For the first time in twenty-one years, she had allowed herself to think back all the way to the moment she stepped inside the house. She would usually force her memories to change course before she got that far. But today she had walked the plank, and as she slowly started to make her way back to the car, she tried to determine whether she felt more broken.</p>
