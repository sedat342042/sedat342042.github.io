<p class="noindent1"><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="small-caps">T WAS PAST</span> noon when Louise got to the department, but instead of going straight to her own office, she headed directly for Rønholt’s front office. And Hanne.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She had to have a talk with the secretary. If their relationship continued down this road, it would eventually come to a crash, and she knew herself well enough to know that she might end up saying a lot of things that were both rash and filled with anger—admittedly not the smartest thing to do now that she had put herself in a position where she could get the boot on relatively short notice.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She had come to realize that she’d made a mistake in falling for Rønholt’s offer and his words of praise. There was no doubt in her mind that Eik had been telling the truth when he said others had been offered the opportunity to head the new special unit but had turned it down because it was a sinking ship. Of course none of them were foolish enough to put their steady <a id="page-156"></a>and secure jobs on the line for a new unit that was at risk of being short-lived and apparently only served as an office where cases were pushed through in order to be closed and archived as quickly as possible. She was furious with herself now for not making sure that her contract stipulated her right to return to one of the established departments should it become necessary to close down this new unit after the trial period. She had been so eager to get away from the dreaded Michael Stig, who had replaced her old boss, that she acted without thinking.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Come in!” Hanne’s voice sounded chirpy when Louise knocked but her smile faded when she saw who it was. “Well,” she said just before Louise stopped her, pulling a chair up to her desk.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Hanne, what’s your problem?” she blurted out. “Why do you act like this with me?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">At first Hanne just stared at Louise as if she hadn’t the faintest idea what she might be referring to. Then she gave a small wave as if trying to fan away a smell. But perhaps she was merely trying to hush Louise. Still without saying a word, she reached over and picked up the top item from her letter organizer and handed it to Louise.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She accepted the file but let it drop onto the desk without taking her eyes off Hanne.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Stop it,” she demanded, “and let’s just talk about this. We both know I’m not going to quit the department just because you don’t like my being here,” she continued, growing confused with the look in Hanne’s eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“What do you mean?” the secretary asked uncomprehendingly, awkwardly flicking her big red hair a little as if Louise’s attack was coming as a complete surprise to her. “Why would you quit?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Because you’re being so rude, and frankly it seems as if <a id="page-157"></a>you’d prefer it if I just went away. But I won’t,” Louise emphasized. “We need to figure out a way to work together, so it’s no use for you to withhold information about important meetings. Or for you to keep me in the dark about the routines of the department in general.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">There was a moment of silence between them; then Hanne pointed to the plastic folder on the desk.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I’ve got a phone number for you. They got a DNA result from the woman in the woods, and I promised that you would call them back.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">She said it as if the preceding conversation never happened.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise contemplated her for a second. Then she sighed and picked up the printout from the Forensics Department. She still hadn’t gotten around to putting her name on her cubbyhole.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Thanks,” she said and stood up.</p>
<p class="space-break">O<span class="small-caps">N HER WAY</span> back to the office, she wondered what in the world she was going to do about Hanne. In the end she would probably have to speak with Rønholt.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Hey!” someone called from behind her.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She turned around. When she spotted Olle, she realized that she never thanked him for the drawing of the kitchen rat.</p>
<p class="calibre6">He was tall and his hair was thinning at the top. Louise guessed that he was at least fifty, but a look in his warm brown eyes, which kept smiling as he walked toward her, made his age difficult to pinpoint.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Did you like it?” he asked expectantly, like a child who drew a picture for his parents.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise wasn’t sure if it was her expression or because she waited too long to answer, but in any event, he seemed to catch on to the fact that she probably wasn’t a major fan of cartoons.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-158"></a>“I can make something else,” he quickly offered. “I just thought I should make you something now that you’re going to be working with us.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“No-no,” she burst out, embarrassed that he should have to suffer for her irritable mood. “It’s really cool and it was so nice of you. I didn’t even know you had that kind of talent.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I’ve got all kinds of talent,” he retorted in a velvety smooth voice, stepping closer and smiling.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise was so taken aback at his undisguised flirtation that she couldn’t think to do anything but just stand there with a sheepish smile.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“You be sure to let me know if you feel like exploring some of the other ones,” he went on as she slowly began to take a few steps backward.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Olle!”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Eik came out of the cleaning room, tucking his pack of cigarettes in his pocket.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“She’s mine.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise turned around, feeling relieved that her rescuer wasn’t having lunch at Posten with the others. She gave a quick nod to the tall, gangly cartoonist and fled down the hall toward the Rathole.</p>
<p class="space-break">“D<span class="small-caps">ID YOU ATTEND</span> the managers’ meeting?” Louise asked as she walked through the door. Then her nose caught a strange smell in the office and she fell silent. Her initial thought was that maybe the rats were back.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Eik had pushed their desks up against the wall to make room on the floor.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I was busy,” he declared without looking at her. His desk was a mess of papers, which lifted as the wind caught them. <a id="page-159"></a>“I printed out information on every registered Toyota HiAce that’s white with no windows, and I was working on screening out the newer models when they called from the Forensics Department to say that we could come pick up Lise Andersen’s clothes.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">As Louise walked over to her desk and put down her bag, she realized that the musty smell was coming from the clothes.</p>
<p class="calibre6">He was laying them out on the floor. He had already smoothed out the rust-red, smock-like dress and was now placing a pair of navy-blue ankle socks next to it.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“They’re completely worn out.” He held out one of them to show her the large holes. “That’s why it looked like she’d been walking barefoot.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise nodded.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I’m just trying to see if maybe there’s something about her clothes that might give us a clue to go on. But the dress doesn’t have a tag, and if you come over here you’ll see that the fabric is worn completely shiny. It’s old.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">But Louise didn’t look at the dress. Instead she looked at him as he proceeded to pick up an undershirt from the small cardboard box. Even though Eik was too much in every way, she had to admit that Rønholt was right about him being energetic and good at finding new angles.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“They got a DNA result,” Louise told him. She dialed up the DNA section of the Forensics Department.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Eik had finished laying out the clothes and walked over to get the camera from his desk. Then he began to photograph each piece of clothing.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I guess it’s unlikely that we’ll be able to trace the dress,” he assessed while Louise waited for her call to be transferred.</p>
<p class="calibre6">He had made no comments on the fact that she had come in late, nor her calling in sick the previous day. Perhaps he hadn’t <a id="page-160"></a>even noticed, she thought, and told the man who picked up her call which case she was calling about. “You asked me to call.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">To Eik, Louise mouthed <em class="calibre5">They got a positive DNA match.</em> The man who had intercourse with Lisemette before she fell to her death was already in the police DNA database.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She was about to ask for the civil registration number when the man added that the person was identified by neither name nor civil registration number. His DNA alone was linked to another case. The perpetrator’s identity was unknown.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“But there must be a reference number?” she interjected and jotted it down as he read out the information.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She quickly wrapped up the call and punched in the reference number. Her fingers froze over the keys as she started to read.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“It’s him!” she said without taking her eyes off the screen to look at Eik, who was on the floor with the camera.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Who?” he asked.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“It’s the same guy,” she said. “The man who killed the child care provider also had intercourse with Lise. And when I was talking to Mik it sounded like he was pretty sure that the perpetrator could also be linked to the missing runner.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Eik left the camera on the floor as he got to his feet and walked over to stand behind her chair.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“But if it’s him then why didn’t he hurt Lise?” he asked. “There isn’t the slightest indication that she was the victim of an assault. Her clothes weren’t disheveled, and there were no tears or hematomas on her lower body.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise shook her head, momentarily unable to think of an answer.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Maybe she didn’t try to fight it?” she finally suggested, following him with her eyes as he returned to the clothes on the floor.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-161"></a>“You think he took his leisurely time to undo the whole long fastening in her dress? And what about her underwear? None of the things are torn or ripped. I’m not buying that this was rape,” he concluded.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Then what do you think?” Louise asked, growing exasperated as he merely shrugged and reached for the camera.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I think they knew each other,” he said, looking up at her. “And if that’s the case, then he might also have access to Mette.”</p>
