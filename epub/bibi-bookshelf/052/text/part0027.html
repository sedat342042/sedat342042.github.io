<p class="noindent1"><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="small-caps">HERE ARE YOU</span>?” Camilla asked when Louise finally answered her cell phone. She had been calling pretty much every ten minutes for the past hour even though she had figured out that Louise must have set her phone to silent mode. Anger was still pumping through her body, and her throat was sore from yelling. She couldn’t even remember everything she had said. Could she have called off the wedding?</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Can I stay with you for a little while?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">She had packed a large weekend bag and already slammed the door behind herself.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Markus had come home from school in the middle of their fight and when she turned her back to Frederik to go upstairs and pack, she had popped into her son’s room and told him to get some clothes together along with his schoolbooks for the rest of the week.</p>
<p class="calibre6">But he wasn’t about to go anywhere. He wanted to stay with <a id="page-171"></a>Frederik until she came around, and Camilla didn’t have the strength to argue with him as well.</p>
<p class="calibre6">So now she had walked out on both of them and wondered if she’d just written herself out of the chapter that was supposed to be the beginning.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“It’s only for a few days, until I can find something else,” she said, adding that she had to give the couple who was subletting her apartment thirty days’ notice.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Of course,” said Louise, and suddenly Camilla couldn’t cope with the thought of starting over one more time. Her life was a succession of restarts. When she met Tobias and got pregnant, she had thought that it was going to be forever but it seemed like only a second later that she was left alone with an eighteen-month-old boy. Every attempt at starting a relationship since had capsized.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“We only just left Holbæk to head back to the department so it’ll be a little while before I get home,” she heard Louise say while she blew her nose.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“No need to rush. I’ve still got my key,” she said and promised to take care of dinner.</p>
<p class="space-break">L<span class="small-caps">OUISE ASSUMED IT</span> was Camilla calling again as she was about to put her cell phone back in her bag. But this time it was Lisemette’s father on the other end of the line.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“We buried Lise today,” he told her. “The funeral was beautiful, and of course the weather couldn’t have been nicer.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I’m so sorry,” Louise said warmly. She hoped he’d make his peace, and was glad he’d at least gotten lovely weather for the somber event. She’d noticed that the warm May sun had inspired people to put on shorts and T-shirts. After a long winter, they couldn’t wait to shed the heavy layers.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Now she’s resting next to her mother, and the minister gave <a id="page-172"></a>a nice sermon even though the two of them never knew each other. Well, my wife and the kids didn’t know her, either…”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I’m glad it went well,” Louise said.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“But now my wife and I were just sitting here talking about Mette,” he said. “She would get very anxious if she felt insecure and scared. I can’t help wondering if she’s just left to her own devices now, sitting out there somewhere feeling miserable and scared. So I wanted to check if maybe there’s any news?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise leaned her head back against the soft headrest of the car while she weighed her answer.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“No,” she answered honestly. “We don’t have anything yet. Right now we’re working on finding out where your daughters have been staying all these years.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I’ve also been wondering if maybe we could find someone who remembers something from back then,” he continued, “but I don’t recall the supervisor’s name, only that it was a man.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“As soon as we have even the slightest clue to go on, I promise you’ll be the very first to know.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“You think she’s alive?” he asked, his voice hopeful, and Louise slumped down a little. She thought about the crushed dog and the old homicide cases and couldn’t bring herself to tell him about the beast they were hunting in the woods.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“If she’s alive, we’ll find her,” she said grandly, refraining from letting on what she personally believed.</p>
<p class="calibre6">He thanked her so profusely that Louise felt filled with shame at the thought that she might have promised more than she could deliver.</p>
<p class="space-break">C<span class="small-caps">AMILLA HAD PUT</span> out hummus, ham, sausage, and cheese on the table. It looked like she had cleared out an entire delicatessen, Louise thought.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-173"></a>“The bread’s in the oven,” Camilla said and sank onto a kitchen chair, taking a large gulp of her wine.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise patted Dina and went to pour the dog’s food in her bowl before taking a seat across from her friend.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She had a headache, and the Tylenol she’d taken before biking home hadn’t kicked in yet. She accepted the glass of wine that her friend handed her and thought that it might be more effective to wash away the thoughts of Klaus and the beast still on the loose.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I think it’s over,” Camilla said, putting her glass down. “I’m not so sure that Frederik is the kind of guy who lets you just slam the door in his face.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“You did that?” Louise asked before getting up to find a bread basket when the timer for the bread went off.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I just got so angry, I couldn’t help it. I was minding my own business, having a sandwich in the kitchen. Suddenly he’s standing in the doorway, with that look on his face.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">She grimaced and picked her glass back up before giving Louise an indignant look. “Do you know what he said to me?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise shook her head dutifully.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“That I’d have to face the fact that it takes a bit of manners to be among the model citizens of Roskilde.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise was making herself a plate, but put her fork down and started laughing.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Frederik seems to think that there are certain rules I have to abide by if we’re to keep living at the manor house.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Camilla topped off both of their glasses and grabbed a piece of bread.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“It’s not like I don’t know how to behave,” she said with hurt in her voice. “It’s one thing that he got mad about me firing the workers. But they weren’t keeping to our agreement! And isn’t a minister supposed to marry people the way he promised?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">She put a piece of bread in her mouth and chewed angrily.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-174"></a>“I’m running around to all these lame-ass things,” she went on. “The other day, I was squeezed into a corner at some charity auction and could barely stand up when it finally ended because my legs were asleep from boredom. But nobody took any notice.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Maybe that’s not what he meant,” Louise suggested. “Maybe he just doesn’t need any more problems.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Problems?” Camilla asked uncomprehendingly. “He doesn’t have any damn problems. I end up with all of them!”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“If given a choice, don’t you think he would have preferred you and Markus moving to Santa Barbara so he could continue his life over there?” Louise asked.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Camilla shrugged.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Instead of working his ass off in a family company that he never had any desire to run?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">She fell silent when her friend cast down her eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Enough about him,” Camilla said and told Louise about her visit to the patient care assistant who’d worked at Eliselund. “It was boiling water that ruined her face. Her skin was scalded off. It’s unbearable to think of. And Agnete Eskildsen was the one who turned on the tap.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise breathed in and exhaled heavily.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“She told me that the supervisor down there told the twins’ father a story that it was the girl’s sister who had been careless with a kettle of boiling water, but she also said that it was solely to protect the reputation of the institution and not to cover up for her.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Then it’s no wonder she reacted when she saw the photo in the newspaper,” Louise said.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Camilla nodded and added that Agnete had told her that the twins were inseparable. “I can barely stand to think where Mette might be now,” Camilla exclaimed. “Or what’s become of her.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Did Agnete have any idea about how something like this could have happened?”</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-175"></a>“She hasn’t been keeping up with what’s been going on down there. The director retired and someone new replaced him, but as she said when I was leaving, she turned her back on Eliselund after the accident.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">The phone rang in the living room, and Louise got up to answer it. These days, just about the only people who called her home number were her parents and Melvin.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Why don’t you come out here to the gardens for a cup of evening coffee?” Melvin asked when he found out that Camilla was visiting.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I don’t think either one of us is in any condition to drive,” Louise admitted, although the idea of sitting in the small garden and letting go of all her thoughts about the case did hold a certain appeal.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“That’s too bad. There’s something I want to show you.” He told her that a garden lot would be going up for sale just a few houses down on the same path as Grete’s friend’s place. “It’s going to be any day now.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Well, you should buy it!” Louise exclaimed. “Let’s buy it together.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">She could just picture it: Melvin puttering around an herb garden, digging up new potatoes; her in a hammock while Jonas was cultivating all his new friendships.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Yes, I’m in,” she announced rather giddily just as Melvin added that it couldn’t hurt to take a look since he got an inside tip before it really went on the market.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Wouldn’t it be nice to just move out and live in a small house in the community gardens, and not have to deal with work and annoying colleagues?” Louise said when she returned to the kitchen, where Camilla had cleared the table and opened up another bottle of wine even though it was already getting late.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“That would probably be kind of a bummer,” her friend <a id="page-176"></a>interjected. “Don’t they turn off the water and you’re not even supposed to live out there in the winter?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I have no idea.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise hadn’t considered the obligations that went with the idea, but she supposed that Melvin would be the one to take care of those things.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I thought it sounded like you weren’t liking your new department so much. Are you having second thoughts?” Camilla asked, opening a sleeve of crackers for the cheese.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise stared straight ahead for a second. Was she having second thoughts? Perhaps a little. She was still quite appalled that Rønholt had stabbed them in the back and almost forced them to close the case.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“If he had gotten away with making us close the case about Lisemette, I would have had to put my job on the line for it. I can’t just sit around a place where it’s all about processing case numbers through the system in order to achieve an impressive percentage of solved ones.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“What about that guy you’re working with?” Camilla asked, looking at her curiously.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise laughed wearily. “Eik Nordstrøm. On our first day I had to go scoop him up from some dive bar in Sydhavnen. He’s a chain smoker who listens to Nick Cave and only wears black.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Wouldn’t it be better for you to bring Lars Jørgensen over?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">They had finished the last bottle, and Louise gratefully left the cleanup to Camilla to get ready for bed.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“No,” she said to her own surprise before going to brush her teeth. “I kind of like that he’s straightforward. He doesn’t do a lot of bullshit and he backed me up when Rønholt was trying to screw us over. It’s more Hanne who’s being a cow. Eik is all right.”</p>
