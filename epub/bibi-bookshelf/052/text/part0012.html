<p class="noindent1"><span class="dropcap">G</span><span class="small-caps">OOD MORNING</span>,” Eik greeted Louise as she stopped in the doorway to their office just before 8 a.m. He had his feet on the desk, her large tea mug full of black coffee in his hand, and the morning paper in his lap.</p>
<p class="calibre6">He was wearing black again. Louise figured it was probably just his standard wardrobe.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Good morning,” she mumbled and put her bag down on the floor next to the desk.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“You want some?” he asked, pushing a bakery bag toward her.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise shook her head. “No thanks, but I would like my tea mug.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">He looked at her with obvious confusion until she pointed to his coffee.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Oh,” he said. “There weren’t any thermoses out there so I just grabbed the one that would hold the most. You can have it when I’m done, okay?”</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-60"></a>She sighed and went to fill her electric kettle and find a mug.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“The woman <em class="calibre5">was</em> a child care provider, just thirty-four years old,” Eik went on with a gesture toward the paper. “But other than that, your friend up there in Holbæk isn’t letting much out of the bag. Did he put a lid on it, or what’s going on?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise shrugged. “I have no idea. I didn’t talk to them,” she answered. She was annoyed that she had only been able to find a small white cafeteria cup for her tea. “Can’t we just stay focused on the one we need to identify?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Eik nodded. He folded the paper and tossed it on the floor.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“She’s not showing up on the Danish lists of missing persons, so how about searching the international records? See if there’s been any description through the years that matches the scar on her face?” Louise asked, secretly pleased that he couldn’t reach his computer without taking his feet off the desk.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Which time period are we looking at?” he replied, moving Louise’s mug to the window next to his dirty cup from the day before.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre5">If this is a woman who went into hiding, we’ll start by going back twenty years</em>, she decided. “Start by searching for women born between 1960 and 1975, and see who’s been reported missing in that age group since 1990.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise recalled the smooth skin on the uninjured side of the woman’s face and her almost childlike expression and briefly wondered if perhaps the woman was actually younger.</p>
<p class="calibre6">It was quiet in the office while Eik logged on to Interpol’s headquarters in Lyon.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I sent them the picture yesterday,” he said after a little while, “and I think they would have reacted to her distinctive scar if she’d been in their register. But I’ll look through the list myself now.”</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-61"></a>“Good.” Louise didn’t have enough experience in the new department to know whether Interpol headquarters would notify them if there was a match in the international register of missing persons.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She opened up the national register and entered “1990” in the search field. She pulled up a list of reports and cancellations. The names were still listed in the register even if they had turned up again or been reported as deceased, in which case a cancellation code had been added.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She entered the year of birth in the advanced search field and checked the box on the right to indicate female.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The first case that caught her eye was a woman born in 1964 who went missing on March 3, 1990. But reading farther down on the page, Louise saw that the case had a black marker: The woman had been found dead four months later. The next photograph she focused on was of a small, stocky woman with long, dark hair like a tangled halo around her head. The woman was from Kolding and shared certain similarities with the deceased, but she did not have a scar.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise figured it might be possible that the woman had been reported missing and then subsequently been in an accident, so that the scar wouldn’t be mentioned in the report. But Flemming had said it was an old injury, she reminded herself; she dismissed the Kolding case.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Lower down on the page, her eyes lingered on the town name of Hvalsø. Louise leaned forward and activated the case from 1991. It had been neither canceled nor affixed with a black marker, so the girl had never been found.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She stared at the name for a little while, her eyes squinting, and realization began to dawn. She remembered the case, even though she had moved away from the town by then. Lotte <a id="page-62"></a>Svendsen was the girl’s name, and she had been twenty-three years old when she went missing. She had been a few grades ahead of Louise, who had only recognized her from her picture.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Lotte Svendsen had been reported missing in connection with the town’s annual Whitsun celebration. It was the night between Saturday and Sunday when there had been a party at the sports center. Louise suddenly realized that she had never cared to know how the case turned out. Those were the years when she had put Hvalsø behind her. <em class="calibre5">So the girl never turned back up.</em></p>
<p class="calibre6">But Lotte Svendsen fit the description of their Jane Doe in no way. The next couple of women in the age group had all been found and canceled in the system. And then there was one more that same year, but Louise quickly determined that she was not the woman they were looking for, as she was tall and fair. She only dwelled on the case because this one had never been closed, either. The woman was nineteen and had been living with her parents in Espergærde. She had disappeared while visiting a friend who went to boarding school in Ny Tolstrup.</p>
<p class="calibre6">This case was one Louise had never heard of, probably because she had spent so little time at her parents’ place in the years after she left town.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The cases had long been deleted from the electronic system and were now only stored in the basic archive, which didn’t hold much information. All she found was that the second case had been placed with the old Search Department three weeks after the young woman’s disappearance. Back then it had also been noted that there might be a connection to the missing person case from Hvalsø. The two towns were only about five miles apart, and both places bordered on the woods in which the girls, according to witness statements, had disappeared. Otherwise, there were no links between the two girls, and the lead was a dead end.</p>
<p class="space-break"><a id="page-63"></a>H<span class="small-caps">ANNE OPENED THE</span> door without knocking to remind them of the department meeting at ten.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Did you put the cake in the kitchen?” she asked, looking at Louise.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“The cake?” Louise answered, puzzled.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Yeah—we take turns bringing cake,” Hanne said. “Did you think it turned up by itself?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise had only attended the weekly department meeting once and had given no thought at all to how the snacks ended up on the table. “No, I didn’t realize it was my turn.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“It’s on the cake list,” Hanne informed her and let her know that it was posted on the notice board in the lunchroom.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Nobody had bothered to tell Louise about any cake list. She suspected the “someone” who should have told her was Hanne.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I’ll run down to the bakery,” Eik cut in. “Just tell them I’ll be back in a few minutes.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">The meeting was scheduled to begin in five minutes but he had already put on his jacket and was heading out the door.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“No, don’t,” Hanne said, quickly heading him off. “I’ve got a box of cookies as backup. We’ll have those today.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Eik gave her a big smile. “Honey, I’m all out of smokes, so I’ve got to go down there anyway,” he said, patting her cheek.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise sighed wearily as she got up to go to Rønholt’s office. The hallway walls were painted a pale green, and apparently someone had a penchant for cartoons, because black-and-white drawings of all the well-known cartoon characters were displayed in varnished wood frames the whole way. Only now did Louise discover that a new one had been added right across from her door: Remy, the kitchen rat from the movie <em class="calibre5">Ratatouille.</em></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-64"></a><em class="calibre5">Oh, funny!</em> she thought, sarcastically at first but then she couldn’t help but smile. She didn’t recall the names of the three investigators down the hall. They were all guys, and the artist had to be one of them, she guessed.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“You like it?” Eik asked from behind her.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Like it?” Louise asked. “I don’t think the point was for me to like it. Isn’t it just meant to remind me that I’m the one who got the office that was infested?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I don’t think so,” he said as they walked down the hallway together. “Olle is the one who drew it, and I’m guessing it’s his housewarming gift to you. He’s really talented, and he’s made a drawing like that for everyone in the department. I got Goofy.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">He pointed toward his old office, where the picture hung right next to the door.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Olle’s been in the department the longest,” he continued, “even though Hanne claims he could actually make a living selling his pictures. But he only paints on the weekends and when he takes time off for his overtime.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise couldn’t quite imagine who would actually pay money for the cartoon characters in the glossy frames, but perhaps that was just because she was not the target audience.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Well, then I’d better hurry up and go thank him,” she said. She was still smiling when Hanne suddenly came rushing toward them.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I’ve just put a phone call through to you,” she said. “It’s a lady who recognizes the woman you’ve been trying to identify.”</p>
