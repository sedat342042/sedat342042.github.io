<p class="noindent1"><span class="dropcap">C</span><span class="small-caps">ONGRATULATIONS</span>,” R<span class="small-caps">AGNER</span> R<span class="small-caps">ØNHOLT</span> exclaimed from the doorway the following morning. “Good job with the identification. Now we can close the case.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">He smiled approvingly at Louise and went on: “I’ve gotten ahold of Lars Jørgensen’s résumé, and I intend to have him over for a talk later this week.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise put her hand up to make her boss stop.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“We’re not ready to close the case,” she corrected him. “Lise Andersen has been missing for thirty-one years without anyone knowing it. The case has only just been opened.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“But now that she’s been found and identified, her past is no longer relevant to us,” he maintained.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She looked at him in surprise while he ran his hand over his well-groomed beard.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“What do you mean?” she asked. “If this special unit is to be justified, it is relevant to find out what’s happened in <a id="page-103"></a>this woman’s life since a false death certificate was issued in 1980.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Eik walked through the door, eyes squinting and hair unruly, and she gave him a quick nod.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Weren’t we supposed to look at the cases that can’t be classified as standard disappearance cases?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Exactly,” Rønholt said. “Your job is to focus on missing person cases where we suspect that a crime is involved. And this woman is no longer missing.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Maybe so,” she replied. “But I want to know what happened to Lisemette. How can there be a death certificate when she only just died last week? That seems suspicious to me.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“And how come nobody’s missed her since the accident in the woods?” Eik cut in. “We know that she’d been sexually intimate with a man just before she died. Someone knows about her.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“The case is closed,” Rønholt insisted, and Louise felt flushed with anger as he went on: “Make sure it gets archived correctly in the system that’s been set up for the new department.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">As he was about to leave, she stood up.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“We can’t file it until we know what happened to the twin sisters,” she tried. “What about the other one; where is she? Her death certificate may have been forged as well.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“We have other cases piling up,” was his reply. “And one case closed means one less in the pile.”</p>
<p class="space-break">L<span class="small-caps">OUISE SLAMMED THE</span> door behind him and walked over to the window. She crossed her arms. If it turned out that she had quit the Homicide Department for a job that was only about closing and archiving cases, it would be the mistake of a lifetime. The anger felt like a stab in her chest, and she paused for a moment before she was able to turn around and sit down again.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-104"></a>“That’s his weakness,” Eik said after she sat down. “Rønholt tends to be a bit rigid once the workload starts to grow, and he wants to please management by showing results.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I couldn’t care less about who he’s trying to please,” Louise said sourly. “It’s bad practice to close a case before it’s finished. If that’s how it’s going to be then I won’t be at the helm.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I agree.” He put his feet up on the desk. “I suggest we get Viggo Andersen to file a missing person report for Mette. Then we have a case and we can continue.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise looked at him with surprise and nodded approvingly. But then she hesitated. “Can you file a missing person report when there’s a death certificate?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Eik folded his hands behind his head. “If we can show the probability that she didn’t pass away back then, either, then I should think so.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Her face turned pensive. “The undertaker…” she said. “The undertaker who arranged the funerals at Eliselund. I’ll call Viggo Andersen and suggest that he have a talk with him.”</p>
