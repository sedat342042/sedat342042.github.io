<p class="noindent1"><span class="dropcap">E</span><span class="small-caps">VERY PART OF</span> Louise’s body ached when she was woken by her phone. She had passed out on the couch the night before after a taxi had dropped her off in Frederiksberg around 11 p.m. The one last beer had turned into many. She had found out that Eik Nordstrøm had only black clothes in his wardrobe because he couldn’t care less about clothes and it was just easier when everything looked the same and he could buy a stack at a time. That piece of information had cost her a beer but in return, he had bought a round when he revealed that he took a dip off the pier in Sydhavnen every morning come rain or shine. Louise had tried asking a few questions about his personal life but he clammed up. She did the same when he wanted to know about her old boyfriend and Big Thomsen.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The phone was still ringing, and Louise swore out loud when her dog poked its wet nose in her face, thrilled to finally see signs of life.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-219"></a>“I’m getting married,” Camilla sang when Louise finally answered the phone.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Hmmm,” she answered, pushing Dina away a little. “Were you able to appease the minister?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“God, no!” Camilla laughed. “I’m getting married today—at eleven thirty at city hall. Frederik made all the arrangements.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise sat up.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I don’t think I’ll be able to make it,” she exclaimed, worried that her friend might expect her to turn up with flowers and champagne.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Well, you’re not invited. We’re going to celebrate our wedding day in bed with plenty of champagne.” Camilla laughed again.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Are you drunk?” Louise asked with confusion as she got up. “Where are you?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I’m at Hotel Prindsen. Frederik rented the suite, and he had scattered red rose petals all across the room before I got there.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“This morning?” Louise asked, checking the time on her phone. She was suddenly worried that she was the one who had overslept. But it was only seven oh four…</p>
<p class="calibre6">“No, we’ve been here since yesterday.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Well, I’m glad you guys made up,” she said, yawning. “What about Markus; where is he?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“He doesn’t know anything. The last time I talked to him was yesterday afternoon when I was on my way home from Eliselund.” Camilla snorted. “The kid called me because he didn’t feel up to walking home from a friend’s house, so he got to stay there and spend the night but we’ll pick him up after we’ve been to city hall.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise sat up straight. “You were at Eliselund yesterday?” she asked as she heard Frederik’s voice and a door closing. “What were you doing there?”</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-220"></a>“Back when the death certificates were signed, the director of the place was someone named Parkov.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I know that,” Louise cut in irritably.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“After Eliselund, she worked at Avnstrup until that closed down, too, but as far as I can tell she still lives out in the woods,” she went on. “I had actually planned to go talk to her myself, but… you know… something more important has kind of come up.” She laughed, adding that she and Frederik had agreed that she would start working again after the wedding. “Apparently I get completely impossible if I don’t have a story to keep me busy.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Could you stop talking for a second?” Louise cut through while she could hear the clatter of plates and silverware in the hotel room. “How do you know that she lives by Avnstrup?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Because I looked her up in the <em class="calibre5">Blue Book</em> and then ran a search for her. She lives on Bukkeskov Road.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Is it Bodil from the gamekeeper’s house?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“How would I know what the place is called?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise tried to focus her thoughts.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“She was at Eliselund when the twins died,” Camilla added. “But then she left shortly after. Lillian was there at the time as well.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Well, I’ll be damned,” Louise said and stood up.</p>
<p class="calibre6">It was one thing that Bodil had not recognized the photograph of Lisemette. But she should at least be able to tell them how the twins had left Eliselund.</p>
<p class="space-break">“W<span class="small-caps">E’RE GOING TO</span> see Bodil,” Louise said breathlessly when she got into the office. Dina had run off in Frederiksberg Park because Louise had gambled on finishing up their morning walk faster by letting her off the leash. But the dog didn’t return <a id="page-221"></a>when Louise called her; it wasn’t until fifteen minutes later, when she spotted the yellow Lab on the grass with a chocolate counterpart, that she had succeeded in calling her dog over.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She removed her sunglasses from her hair, which had air-dried during her bike ride. She could tell from the look on Eik’s face that he expected her to elaborate.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“And then we need to have a talk with Lillian Johansen, who still works at Eliselund,” she said, telling him about Camilla’s visit to the day center.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Last night was fun,” Eik said, his voice raspy, and it was only then that Louise got a good look at him.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Jesus!” she blurted out. “What happened to you?” The bags under his eyes made them look small and screwed-up and he had a large scrape across his left temple.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I didn’t do as good a job as you going home,” he said, rubbing his wound. “And then this morning I misjudged the distance to the wharf when I jumped in the water.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“You look like hell. What about the car? Did you drive here?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Yes. We can take my car; it’s parked down there,” he said and added that first he would like to go by the cafeteria to get something to eat. “Do you want anything?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise hadn’t had time for breakfast or tea before dashing out the door, so she nodded as he got up. At least he didn’t smell like booze, she thought as he walked by her.</p>
<p class="calibre6">While Eik was getting them food, Louise went to inform Rønholt that they were driving out to Hvalsø.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“You look nice!” Hanne said appreciatively and pointed to Louise’s hair, which was still hanging down. Confused, Louise stopped for a second in the doorway before Hanne nodded to signal that it was okay for her to go in. “He’s not busy.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Take a look at this,” Rønholt said when he saw her. He <a id="page-222"></a>waved her over to his window and pointed to a large yellow-and-brown flower.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“We’re going to Hvalsø,” she said and began to retreat toward the door.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“It’s a lady’s slipper,” he said lovingly, “the largest and rarest type of orchid in all of Europe. It only blooms for two weeks. Isn’t it beautiful?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Orchids had never been Louise’s strong suit but she nodded. It did look pretty with its heavy flowers.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“By the way, they called from Holbæk to say that they were very happy with your interview.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Thanks,” said Louise, her hand on the door handle. “I’m glad to hear it. They’ve got plenty on their plates right now with the murder in the woods and the runner who’s still missing.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“In fact, it sounded like there would probably be a spot for you up there if this agency doesn’t work out,” he said, letting go of the plant.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“That won’t be necessary,” she cut in tartly. “The new agency will work out, and there’s no way I’m going to Holbæk.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">She stopped in the hallway and thought that it was pretty darn soon for Rønholt to start airing his doubts about the new special agency. She watched Eik walk down the hall holding two small bottles of 1 percent milk and a couple of cut sandwich rolls, which he balanced on a paper plate.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“We’re bringing it, right?” he asked, gesturing toward the food.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise pulled herself together and walked with him toward the office while thinking that maybe it was quite normal to be less affected by hangovers if you kept up your state of intoxication on a regular basis.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Yup,” she said and picked up her bag. “Let’s get going.”</p>
