<p class="noindent1"><span class="dropcap">L</span><span class="small-caps">OUISE BOUGHT A</span> sandwich from the hospital cafeteria and finished her Sprite before getting up from the bench. She considered going back to the ward to make another attempt to speak with Bitten, but obviously the woman wasn’t going to cough up the name of her lover as long as her husband was there. She would wait to try again when Bitten was back home.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She’d just left the large parking lot when Eik called to tell her that he had been working on the list of previous employees at Eliselund and had made an appointment with the consultant doctor’s widow.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“It was her husband that signed the death certificates,” he said and told her that he was meeting her in Solrød at 7 p.m. “I thought you might like to come?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">That was in an hour. Louise glanced at her watch and told him that she’d just finished up in Roskilde.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-212"></a>“I could meet you down there,” he suggested. “Or I can talk to Birte Holsted alone.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I’ll be there,” Louise said quickly, surprised that Eik was even still at work. She had called when she left Hvalsø to assist the Holbæk police with the interview, and it had sounded like he was running out of steam looking for the previous employees at Eliselund. But it suited her just fine because it would give her an excuse to put off her talk with Melvin. She wasn’t looking forward to disappointing him by backing out of the community garden project.</p>
<p class="space-break">E<span class="small-caps">IK WAS STANDING</span> by the curb in front of a yellow single-family house when she turned the corner onto the residential street behind the Solrød train station. He stepped on his cigarette to put it out and walked in front of her up the driveway, where an elderly lady was waiting to receive them, a crutch under her one arm and an unwelcoming look on her face.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“We’ll sit in here,” said the widow, who explained she needed the crutch because of recent hip surgery.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She showed them into the living room, where a wide patio door was open, the evening sun casting a blanket of light on the floor. For once, Louise had hoped that there would be coffee waiting on the table, but there was nothing to suggest that the former consultant doctor’s widow had any intention of serving them anything.</p>
<p class="calibre6">And she didn’t point toward the comfortable couch when she asked them to have a seat.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Here you go,” she said, pulling out a high-backed chair by the dining table instead before hobbling to the head of the table herself. “You know, I have no idea why you suddenly want to <a id="page-213"></a>talk about Ernst. It’s been so long since we buried him that even our grandchildren have had babies in the meantime.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I understand your surprise,” Eik said, taking off his leather jacket before edging down onto the hard chair. “But as I said on the phone, this is really more about Eliselund than it is about your late husband.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise watched him while he talked. His voice was deep and pleasant, confidential, she thought. He folded his hands on the table and smiled disarmingly at the widow.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“We’re working on an old missing person case and in that connection, we’re trying to locate some of the people who worked at the institution in the time before it closed down,” he continued. “And during that time, your husband was still working down there.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“My husband killed himself while working down there,” the widow corrected him.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“What do you mean?” Louise cut in.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Birte Holsted slowly looked at her.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“He committed suicide,” she merely said. “He ruined our lives.” Her lips were tight and her gaze lingered somewhere above their heads.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“When did it happen?” Louise moved forward in her seat a little.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The widow grabbed on to her crutch, which was about to slide down from the back of the chair. “They cut him down on March sixteen, 1980,” she said, her face impassive, and put the crutch on the floor. “I knew for a long time that some things were going on down there. I could feel him pulling away from us. He became increasingly pressured and shut himself off. It was only after his death that I heard about the case.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“The case?” Louise asked.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-214"></a>“A disciplinary case had been launched against him. He was under suspicion of gross medical misconduct but they never got to the bottom of it,” she told them. Then she straightened up and looked at them.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“My husband was weak and unable to set boundaries,” she said.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Can you be a little more specific?” Eik asked patiently.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“There was a director at the place who caught him making a mistake,” she told them, “and then he was caught in her snares. Finally, the pressure became too much. And even though it was hard at the time, I’ll readily admit that what happened was probably for the best.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“His death?” asked Louise, and the widow nodded. “What happened?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“They claimed that a patient died of pneumonia because my husband didn’t start treatment in time.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Was it a young woman who died?” Louise asked, leaning in over the table.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The widow looked at her and shook her head.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“It was a young, mentally retarded boy,” she replied as if that made it insignificant. “It wasn’t until after his death that I learned there was another case against him, one that was far more serious and would have led to his dismissal as well as a prison sentence if he hadn’t prevented that himself.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“What was it concerning?” Eik quickly asked.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The widow sighed heavily. “You’d be better off asking Bodil Parkov what went on at Eliselund back then. She was the director down there, and if anyone knows it would be her.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">The look she shot in Louise’s direction held many years’ worth of bitterness.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Did your husband issue death certificates for a pair of <a id="page-215"></a>seventeen-year-old twin sisters before his death? Did you ever hear about them?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise couldn’t be sure but she thought she saw a twitch across the widow’s wrinkled forehead before she shook her head and pressed her lips together.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“One of the twins was just buried,” Louise said. “She didn’t actually die back then, and we need to know if the other one is still alive, too, and how the two sisters disappeared from Eliselund.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I couldn’t tell you,” Birte Holsted said, slumping. “I never heard about any twins.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">She suddenly looked tired. Even if she had reacted to the question about the forged death certificates, she now seemed to be telling the truth in saying that she didn’t know anything about Lisemette.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Perhaps you can help us with the names of some of the others who worked at Eliselund at the same time as your husband?” Eik tried, ignoring the fact that Louise had gotten up from her chair.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I didn’t know any of them,” the widow answered quietly. “My husband didn’t talk about the patients or the employees once he was finally home. And we were quite thankful for that, really.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">She bent down and picked her crutch up from the floor, preparing to walk them out.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“We’ll show ourselves out,” Louise quickly said as Eik got up and thanked her for the conversation.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“That’s enough to make you want a drink,” Eik moaned as they were standing on the sidewalk once again. “What a life. Do you suppose she’s been sitting in there feeling resentful for the past thirty years?”</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-216"></a>Louise shrugged and began walking toward the car. “It certainly doesn’t seem like the two of them had the ideal relationship,” she conceded and asked where he had parked.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“The train was faster,” he said, jumping at Louise’s offer to drive around Sydhavnen to drop him off.</p>
<p class="calibre6">When they pulled up in front of Ulla’s, Eik gave it another shot.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Come on, just one,” he coaxed. “I’m buying.”</p>
<p class="space-break">“P<span class="small-caps">ATIENTS DIED BECAUSE</span> he neglected his work,” Louise said after Ulla had stopped by their table, placing two beers in front of them.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The room was smoky; behind their table, four men were playing pool. Louise leaned forward in an attempt to make herself heard above the jukebox.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“But you can’t exactly call it neglect when a person manages to survive their own death certificate,” she said, shaking her head. “What the heck did he have to gain from writing Lisemette out of the system? And what did the widow mean when she said that he was caught in the director’s snares?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Eik threw back a shot and raised his glass to let Ulla know that he was ready for another.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“It also sends a strong message that he chose to take his own life down here,” he said and put his cigarettes on the table. “Do you mind if I smoke?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise laughed and shook her head. She looked around. “Thanks for asking, but everyone is smoking in here.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“So, he killed himself at Eliselund because he wanted to make sure that everyone saw him take the consequences of his mistakes,” Eik said, getting back on point.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“And why was that important to him?” Louise asked, <a id="page-217"></a>looking down at the table when a dark-haired man with a beer belly and leather vest leaned on her chair and asked if she wanted to dance.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Jønne, get lost,” Eik said, waving him off.</p>
<p class="calibre6">There were only eight or nine patrons at Ulla’s. Aside from the ones playing pool, the rest were hanging out by the bar where Ulla herself was holding court with her meaty arms on the counter and eyes that regularly wandered to Eik and Louise’s table.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Because something was over,” he continued. “He took the consequences of something that had happened.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Something to do with Lisemette?” Louise suggested. When he asked if she wanted to share one last beer, she agreed.</p>
