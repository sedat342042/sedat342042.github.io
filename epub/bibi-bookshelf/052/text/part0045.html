<p class="noindent1"><em class="calibre5">The Forgotten Girls</em> is a work of fiction, and I have liberally changed and adapted reality to fit into my story.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Some parts are based on actual events that took place at the old mental institutions around the country. Most, though, are figments of my imagination—just as none of the characters in this novel are based on real people.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Likewise, I have taken a casual approach to the geography of the area around Hvalsø, which was the setting of my own youth. Most of the places are real but many have moved around a little in this book. Eliselund, however, exists only in my mind.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Finally, I would like to extend a big thank-you to everyone who so openly and kindly took the time to help me in my research for this book. My special thanks to Charlotte, Steen Holger, Tom, Lotte, and Christine.</p>
