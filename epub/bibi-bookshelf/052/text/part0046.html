<p class="noindent1">S<span class="small-caps">ARA</span> B<span class="small-caps">LAEDEL</span>’<span class="small-caps">S</span> interest in stories, writing, and especially crime fiction was nurtured from a young age, long before Scandinavian crime fiction took the world by storm. Today she is Denmark’s “Queen of Crime,” and her series featuring police detective Louise Rick is adored the world over.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The daughter of a renowned Danish journalist and an actress whose career included roles in theater, radio, TV, and movies, Sara grew up surrounded by a constant flow of professional writers and performers visiting the Blaedel home. Despite a struggle with dyslexia, Sara found in books a world in which to escape when her introverted nature demanded an exit from the hustle and bustle of life.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She tried a number of careers, from a restaurant apprenticeship to graphic design, before she started a publishing company called Sara B, where she published Danish translations of American crime fiction.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-312"></a>Publishing ultimately led Sara to journalism, and she covered a wide range of stories, from criminal trials to the premiere of <em class="calibre5">Star Wars</em>: <em class="calibre5">Episode I The Phantom Menace.</em> It was during this time—and while skiing in Norway—that Sara started brewing the ideas for her first novel. In 2004 Louise and Camilla were introduced in <em class="calibre5">Grønt Støv</em> (<em class="calibre5">Green Dust</em>), and Sara won the Danish Academy for Crime Fiction’s debut prize.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Today Sara lives north of Copenhagen with her family. She has always loved animals; she still enjoys horseback riding and shares her home with her cat and golden retriever. When she isn’t busy committing brutal murders on the page, she is an ambassador with Save the Children and serves on the jury of a documentary film competition.</p>
