<p class="noindent1"><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="small-caps">GNETE</span> E<span class="small-caps">SKILDSEN GOT</span> a thermos from the kitchen counter and placed it in front of Camilla before turning around to pick up the small plate of cookies next to the coffeemaker.</p>
<p class="calibre6">When Camilla had called and asked if she could stop by, she had told Agnete she was a freelance journalist who wrote for various newspapers and magazines. The older woman had accepted this without further questions.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I understand you worked as a care assistant at the institution Eliselund down by Ringsted,” Camilla began. “And that’s how you recognized the girl with the scar?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">The woman nodded, and for a moment it looked as if she were lost in a labyrinth of old memories.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Yes,” she finally replied. “It really was a pity because she was such a pretty little girl.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“So it happened down there?” Camilla burst out. “Do you remember when it happened?”</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-135"></a>Agnete Eskildsen nodded again. “It was in 1970,” she answered without hesitation. “I know because I quit immediately after. That’s why I can say with certainty that it was in July. I preserved berries for the entire first week that I was at home.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Camilla raised an eyebrow, surprised that this was a detail she recalled after so many years.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“During my last year at Eliselund, I was the night nurse in section C. My first husband had fallen ill, so I picked up quite a few night shifts. I spent the days at home with him, and toward the end the only thing I could get him to eat was the stewed fruit I made from our garden,” Agnete Eskildsen explained, adding with a little smile that she hadn’t been very brave back when she worked nights. “We had to make the rounds every hour, and I didn’t like going into the men’s dormitory because they’d be in bed with each other and it wasn’t a quiet affair.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">She briefly lost herself in the memories.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“One night I thought one of the men had a cramp. When I walked into the room, his whole bed was shaking so hard that it had moved away from the wall. I was alone on duty and not really happy about the situation but finally I walked over and lifted up his covers, and then it turns out he was just masturbating. We got exposed to the strangest things,” she said, shaking her head once again.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“How old was Lisemette back then?” Camilla asked.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I’d say she was around eight at the time,” the older woman answered hesitantly.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“What do you recall about the two sisters?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“They were like two peas in a pod,” she answered spontaneously.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Camilla nodded encouragingly.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“One functioned better than the other one, of course, but when they were together they just seemed happy,” Agnete <a id="page-136"></a>Eskildsen remembered. “There was some trouble one time when one of them, the brighter one, had to go to the sick ward for some sort of surgery. Or maybe she’d gotten hurt; I don’t quite recall. In any event, they were separated, and it turned into a big mess.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“How so?” Camilla asked with curiosity, pulling her notepad closer.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“The one who got left behind started banging her head against the wall so violently that the caretaker had to take her to the sick ward. They had to give her a sedative and bring in an extra bed. You couldn’t separate those two.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Camilla looked at her in surprise. “Surely there must have been other times when they had to be apart? They must have gone to the bathroom occasionally?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Agnete Eskildsen smiled for the first time since unlocking her memories and shook her head. “Back then they had large toilet rooms, mind you. There were four toilets lined up against each wall so they’d sit in there together. We’d bring twelve of them to the restroom at a time as I recall.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“In the same room?” Camilla burst out.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Sure. I guess that wouldn’t pass today,” the older woman said, “but that’s how it was done back then.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">She smiled a little and told her that there had actually been quite an uproar when the restrooms were converted and partitions put up around the toilets.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“They didn’t want us to close the doors,” she recalled and explained that the residents didn’t care for change.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Camilla tried to picture it: a large, tiled room with toilets all lined up. It brought to mind the mucking ditch in a livestock barn. <em class="calibre5">No, that wouldn’t pass today</em>, she thought.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I can’t actually think of any other times that the girls were apart,” Agnete Eskildsen continued, shaking her head <a id="page-137"></a>pensively. “When they transferred from the nursery section, they were placed in one of the large dormitories with fifty beds and their two beds were pushed together. That wasn’t usually allowed so they did make some concessions. But then again, they were forgotten girls,” she added.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Forgotten girls?” Camilla repeated.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Agnete Eskildsen nodded. “They had no contact with their family or anyone else from the outside. That’s how the system worked back then. You weeded out the ones who were defective and hid them away. Visitors were a rare occurrence,” she recalled. Several of the mothers were not allowed to visit their children, she went on, because their husbands were annoyed that they would be upset afterward.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“The children?” Camilla asked.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“No, the wives,” she quickly replied. “The visit would leave them so distraught that they forbade them from going. So many of the children never had visitors, and yet they stood faithfully by the gate, waiting for someone to come. It was quite heartrending.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“That sounds crazy,” Camilla said, shaking her head. “But after the accident when Lise was being treated for her wounds, the two sisters couldn’t have stayed together?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Camilla noticed the expression on the woman’s face shifting to something like animosity. It took her by surprise that the night nurse remembered so many details from that time.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Yes, they stayed together,” Agnete Eskildsen finally said. “But that was also the reason they couldn’t send her to be treated at the hospital—because they wouldn’t allow the sister to come along. So she stayed at Eliselund, and our own consultant doctor treated her even though it wasn’t his specialty.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Agnete Eskildsen fell silent for a moment before she added that an extra bed was placed in the sickroom for the sister.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-138"></a>“I imagine they decided that her presence wasn’t important since she was feebleminded anyway,” she added quietly after a little while.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“But the accident,” Camilla said. “What happened?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“It was just that—an accident.” Agnete Eskildsen sighed and looked sadly out the window. “A really bad, no-fault accident.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“How was it no-fault?” Camilla asked.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Agnete Eskildsen folded her hands on the oilcloth in front of her and picked at a fingernail before she reluctantly started to recount the incident.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“We always had to turn up the water heater in the basement the day before the weekly bath day to allow time for the water to heat up. But that day, the thermostat was broken, and that’s when it happened.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">She looked down at the striped oilcloth.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“The girl was already in the tub when the shower with boiling-hot water got turned on, and her screams carried throughout the large building.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Agnete Eskildsen closed her eyes and stayed that way as she went on: “It was me who turned on the water,” she whispered despairingly, “and I’ll never forget her scream. I wake up at night because it tears through my dreams. The skin on her face and down across her shoulder was stripped clear off before we could react, and afterward she wouldn’t let us touch her. She just lay in the bottom of the tub, burning pink, screaming until the consultant doctor came and gave her an injection.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Camilla had put her pencil down. Now she just sat there in shock, listening.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“We hustled everyone out of the bathroom. It wasn’t a pretty sight of course,” Agnete Eskildsen continued after a pause. “They had all been lined up and ready, naked as the day.”</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-139"></a>They both sat in silence, the picture all too clear.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“It was a difficult time afterward,” she acknowledged. “Back then we didn’t talk about it much when things like that happened. At first I tried to forget but now I’ve long come to terms with the image of that terrible wound to her face.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I only stayed till the end of the month. Then I quit and I haven’t used my caretaker training since.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“So you don’t know what became of the two sisters?” Camilla asked after a minute, picking her pencil back up.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Agnete Eskildsen shook her head. “I have no idea. But you can imagine that it brought up a lot of memories when I suddenly saw her picture in the paper.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Camilla nodded sympathetically.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“The last time I saw Lisemette was when they lifted her little body out of the tub. I wasn’t even allowed to visit her in the sick ward, even though I’d bought chocolates for both of them.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">It got quiet again, but this time the silence held so much sadness that Camilla felt that she had to get up and let the woman off.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I put Eliselund behind me,” Agnete Eskildsen said as they were standing in the courtyard after Camilla put her purse in the car. “Mr. Nørskov, who was head of the place, retired a few years later, and I’m not shy to admit that I wasn’t one to send flowers to his farewell reception after the way he treated me—even though it was the janitor who hadn’t serviced the water heater properly.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">She fell silent and thought for a moment.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Toward the end, Parkov was in charge, but I never met her. All I can say for certain about the twin sisters is that they would have, without a doubt, stuck together if at all possible.”</p>
<p class="space-break"><a id="page-140"></a>H<span class="small-caps">ER WORDS STAYED</span> with Camilla as she headed back toward Roskilde. If both sisters were alive when the death certificates were issued, then they must have stayed together. And if Mette was still alive when her sister fell down the slope last week, then where was she now? And how was she managing without her sister?</p>
<p class="calibre6">Camilla’s thoughts were mingling too fast for her to keep them all straight. She pulled over, got her iPhone from her purse, and turned on the voice recorder to make sure she wouldn’t forget the things that needed further investigation when she got back home. It occurred to her that she hadn’t given one thought to Frederik or their wedding plans since the moment she had sat down at Agnete Eskildsen’s oilcloth-covered table.</p>
