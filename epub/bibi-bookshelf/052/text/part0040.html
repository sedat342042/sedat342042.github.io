<p class="noindent1"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="small-caps">HIS TIME</span> L<span class="small-caps">OUISE</span> didn’t notice the old sawmill or the other houses because Eik was driving so fast down Bukkeskov Road that rocks sprayed from underneath the car. She had her eyes fixed on the tall chestnut trees around the gamekeeper’s house.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise had called Mik from the car to briefly update him on their interview with Lillian Johansen and share the information that they had dug up on Jørgen Parkov and the family’s background.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“He lived here back when the first series of rapes happened as well,” she pointed out.</p>
<p class="calibre6">But she had been unable to answer one of Mik’s questions:</p>
<p class="calibre6">“What about the intervening twenty years?” he had asked. “Doesn’t it seem unlikely that he would take that long a break and then pick back up where he left off?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">When they pulled up in front of the gamekeeper’s house, <a id="page-278"></a>the gate in the fence as well as the front door were both wide open.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Something is not right,” Louise said to Eik when she noticed Jørgen’s rake in the middle of the courtyard.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She tore off her headset and hurried toward the house while calling Bodil’s name. The place was eerily quiet. The only sound was from a bird, which flushed from the thatched roof. Her heart was beating fast as she placed her hand on her gun and slowly stepped into the hallway. There was no one in the living room and not a sound to be heard from the rest of the house. She nodded to Eik, signaling for him to proceed to the living room while she headed for the kitchen.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Empty. Two used dishes were left on the table along with an empty milk glass. There were crumbs on the table still, and the butter had not been put away.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise continued slowly toward the door to the room behind the kitchen; then she quietly pressed down the handle and opened it.</p>
<p class="space-break">T<span class="small-caps">HE ROOM WAS</span> shaded by a large tree in the yard and a cool, faintly perfumed scent hit her nostrils as she stepped into Bodil’s bedroom.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Bodil was sitting in a rocking chair between the two windows facing the garden. She was holding a heavy piece of knitting, a pair of large headphones covering her ears while she rocked mechanically back and forward.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise registered her tense breathing and loosened her grip on her pistol while she watched the older woman’s focused work with the knitting needles. She called her name a couple of times before walking over to position herself in front of the rocking chair.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-279"></a>Bodil gave a little start. She looked up and as she removed her headphones, Louise could hear the classical music that had filled her ears. She didn’t speak. She only stared up at Louise with sad eyes while her hands stopped and then dropped limply into her lap.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise squatted down in front of her.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Where’s Jørgen?” she asked.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The woman pressed her lips together and shook her head.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Bodil,” Louise said, this time a little more sharply. “I need to speak with him and it would probably be best if you were there, too.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Bodil’s chin quivered and her lips trembled.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“He’s not home,” she said almost inaudibly.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise placed a hand on the armrest of the rocking chair and stopped its movement.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Where is he?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“In the woods. I told him he had to bring back the lady.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Which lady?” Louise asked, standing back up.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“The one he brought home.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Who’s that?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“The one from the woods that everyone is looking for,” Bodil answered without meeting Louise’s eye.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“The runner?” Louise asked. “Has he been keeping her here?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Yes. Down in his room.”</p>
<p class="space-break">L<span class="small-caps">OUISE SPRINTED OUT</span> of the bedroom, through the kitchen, and into the living room. She registered Bodil following her to the small hallway leading out to the back of the house, where a solid oak door separated Jørgen’s section from the rest of the house. Louise contemplated the heavy bolt at the top of the door. The bolt was unlocked, and the door was open now.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-280"></a>The front room was Jørgen’s bedroom. It was larger than Bodil’s, and one wall was lined with long shelves on which small cars were neatly displayed. Not just Matchbox cars but real collector’s items.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise quickly continued toward the small room in the back but stopped abruptly when the stench hit her. Both windows were open yet the smell was nauseating and acrid. The only object in the dark chamber was a bed, and on it was a crumpled sheet soiled with urine and feces. For a second she felt completely paralyzed as she let the impression sink in; then she walked to the bed and picked up a rope from the floor. It was tied to the headboard.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Has he been keeping her tied to the bed?” she asked without turning around.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Jørgen was always good at knots,” Bodil answered. She walked over to the mattress and started folding up the sheet. “That smell will probably be hard to get out, don’t you think?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise bent down and looked under the bed. There were more ropes and rope snippets but nothing else.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Jesus,” she whispered, straightening herself up. Through the open windows, she heard Eik’s swift footsteps moving across the gravel of the courtyard; a second later he was by the door.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“You’ve got to come over here really quick. There’s something you need to see,” Eik said, his voice sounding grim.</p>
