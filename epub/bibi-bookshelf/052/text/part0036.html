<p class="noindent1"><span class="dropcap">L</span><span class="small-caps">OUISE WAVED TO</span> Jonas as he appeared by the kitchen door. She hadn’t had a chance to call and let him know that she would be by to pick him up. She had missed him.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Hey!” she called out and smiled when her son walked out into the courtyard to say hello to Eik. He was such a great kid. Louise walked over to give him a hug.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Do you feel like going home?” she asked before greeting her father, who came around the corner from the backyard.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“You have to come in the house and listen to what the boy’s been doing with his time while he’s been laid up,” he said and beckoned them inside. “It’s just amazing what these young kids can do with their computers.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“We’ll probably have to listen to it some other time, Dad,” Louise cut in, shooting Eik an apologetic smile. “We have to get back to the city.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Her father turned and gave her a stern look. “It’ll just take a <a id="page-242"></a>second, and of course you have the time to listen to what Jonas can do,” he said, taking it for granted that they would follow him. “He’s very gifted, you know.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Jonas shrugged a little, looking self-conscious.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“It’s nothing, really,” he whispered. “But Grandpa seems to think I’m some sort of musical genius.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“That’s grandparents, I guess,” Eik said, good-humoredly following Louise’s father. In the living room he walked over and introduced himself to her mother and immediately accepted her offer of coffee.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise was still standing in the doorway. The inside of the old timber-frame house had been completely renovated, the walls covered with grayish wood and tile on the floor. The living room opened up into the kitchen where Louise’s mother had insisted on leaving the old woodstove even though she used a new gas stove for cooking.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Her mother walked over to the cupboard, and of course she got out the mugs she herself had thrown and fired. Before Louise knew it, Eik was following her mother outside to the wing that had been set up as a pottery. As the door closed behind them, she heard him inquiring with interest about the things her mother made out there.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“All right, I’m ready,” said Jonas, coming out of the guest room after gathering his stuff.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“No,” Louise hurried to say. “I want to hear what you’ve made.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Not that she expected to be able to tell it apart from what she had listened to through the door to his room, but she wanted to show that she cared about his interests.</p>
<p class="calibre6">He opened his computer on the dining table and asked her if she was ready.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-243"></a>Louise nodded and sat down as he turned up the music. Just then, her mother and Eik walked in through the kitchen door, Eik carrying a small green vase that she’d apparently given him.</p>
<p class="calibre6">He put down the vase and listened for a minute before nodding appreciatively.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“That’s good stuff,” he said and closed his eyes as if tasting the notes. “It’s got kind of a Nick Cave sound but then not really—it’s more contemporary. Who made it?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“The kid did, of course,” Louise’s father boasted. “That’s his music.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Eik raised one bushy eyebrow and didn’t seem to understand.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Jonas makes music,” Louise pitched in. “He’s got several songs on YouTube, and they get played all the time.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Jonas nodded shyly.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“What do you call yourself again?” Louise’s father asked.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Joe H,” he answered quietly. “And the song is called ‘Back to Normal.’ ”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“As in Jonas Holm,” her father enthused with a big smile.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Well, I’ll be,” Eik exclaimed, sounding impressed.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“One of his pieces is on the list of the most popular songs on YouTube,” her father went on.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Jonas smiled a little more confidently.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“It’s what?” Louise exclaimed with surprise and took a step back.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I told you the boy is on to something,” her father said.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Did you think I was kidding when I said I wanted to play at Roskilde Festival?” Jonas asked Louise.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Honestly, yes,” she admitted. She asked him to play the song again.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I told him we need to talk to Kjær,” her father grumbled. <a id="page-244"></a>Kjær was the old family lawyer. “All the stuff about copyright and those kinds of things needs to be looked over by someone who knows about it.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Okay, Grandpa,” Jonas laughed. “We’ll take a look at it.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">It wasn’t that long ago that the boy had started calling Louise’s parents Grandma and Grandpa. It wasn’t something they had talked about. Louise had just suddenly realized that he was saying it and that it sounded natural. She was pleased.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Come on then, superstar. Let’s get back to the city,” she said, swatting at him.</p>
