<p class="noindent1"><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="small-caps">HAT WAS THAT</span> about the kids you guys found?” asked Camilla, who hadn’t seemed overly surprised when her friend showed up after all.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“The girl was just playing as if nothing had happened,” Louise told her. “First we heard the little boy, completely beside himself and dissolved in tears, and then we found the others.” She shook her head a little. “I wonder how long they’d been left to themselves,” she mumbled. She was having a hard time getting the children out of her head. They had been so close when the woman was beaten and killed.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Heineken,” she answered when Camilla asked what she would like to drink and listed off her options. She would not have minded a cigarette, to be honest, if it weren’t for the fact that she had quit long ago. Besides, she had been inhaling Eik’s secondhand smoke all day. She wasn’t sure if this was due to <a id="page-54"></a>seeing Mik again or the encounter with Ole Thomsen. Maybe it was just because the day had been so crappy from start to finish, she thought. It seemed like days had passed since she had picked up Eik Nordstrøm at the bar in Sydhavnen.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I saw Big Thomsen today,” she said after Camilla opened her beer. “Do you remember him?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Camilla shook her head without taking the time to think, but then again she had always been better at putting things behind her than Louise had. “I have no idea who that is.” She put a glass on the table.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Yes, you do,” Louise insisted and started laughing. “You slept with him!”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I did?” her friend asked, surprised. From the look on her face, the discussion didn’t seem to be ringing any bells.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“That time when you visited me in Hvalsø for the Whitsun celebration,” Louise reminded her. “At the very least, you went home with him.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">When they’d first met each other, Camilla lived in Roskilde, too, and it had been difficult to convince her to come to Hvalsø even though the two towns were only one train stop apart.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Well, I don’t remember any of that,” her friend insisted.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Back then he had an apartment in the basement of his parents’ house with a corner bar and a big stereo. His dad was the chief of police in Roskilde. You remember him; you just don’t want to.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Wait,” Camilla said, her eyes moving back and forth as she seemed to shift the pieces in her head. “Oh, that guy! How’s he doing?” she asked, her attention obviously elsewhere. Then she looked out the window and excused herself. “You’ll have to keep yourself entertained for a minute. I think the workers are about to leave even though we had a deal that they were going to keep at it until they finished the back room.”</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-55"></a>Louise was left to drink her beer alone. Through the open doors, she could hear her friend having a loud discussion with someone. She returned to the kitchen soon after, her eyes dark with anger.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I told him that they don’t need to bother coming back,” she groaned. “They’re not finished even though they promised, and they have the nerve to just pick up and go.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">She banged the table angrily with her hand. “It’s Lars Hemmingsen—do you know him? Didn’t he used to hang out with Ole Thomsen and those guys back then?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise didn’t remember him off the top of her head, but Ole Thomsen did always have a group of followers.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“They’ll get it done,” Louise soothed, not sure why this all came as a surprise to Camilla. Everyone knew that contractors never finished on time.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“The painters are coming tomorrow,” her friend added indignantly. “But I guess there’s no point now since those bastards didn’t finish plastering the walls. And you know what?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise dutifully shook her head and listened.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“That Hemmingsen guy asked if we could pay them under the table!”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Oh?” Louise asked, confused.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“But Frederik said he wanted an invoice. Obviously that’s why they’re dragging it out—so they can charge us for more hours.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Camilla had decided to have the wedding at home. She wanted to hold the ceremony in the park behind the house where the grounds sloped down toward Roskilde Fjord; the reception would be inside in the spacious rooms. From what Louise had gathered, Frederik would prefer to have the ceremony at Roskilde Cathedral and then celebrate with a nice dinner at a restaurant, but Camilla refused.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-56"></a>“I ran into Mik out by Avnsø Lake,” Louise said and poured the rest of the beer into her glass. “It was kind of weird seeing him again.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“What was he doing out there?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“He’s head of the investigation.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“The investigation of what?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“The homicide of the woman.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Camilla wasn’t listening at all. If this had been in her old days as a journalist, she would have gobbled up every detail, pressing for more.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Was he doing okay?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Camilla stood by the window, her back turned, watching the workers load their equipment into their vehicles.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise shrugged. “I didn’t ask.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“You were so stupid to screw that up,” Camilla scolded and turned toward her. “Things could have worked out really well for the two of you.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Once again she turned her attention to the workers. Louise emptied her glass in one long swallow to avoid having to reply and stood up, annoyed. Camilla was in a whole other world, and she didn’t have the energy to be part of it.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Just then the door opened and Markus walked in, closely followed by two friends. “Mom, can we go to the movies?” he asked. “And can you give us a ride?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Camilla said a quick hello to her son’s friends and nodded. “As long as you don’t have any homework.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Only then did Markus notice Louise, and he walked over and gave her a hug. It was quicker than they used to be, she noted, remembering that he would be turning fourteen on his next birthday. So perhaps it wasn’t so strange, especially with his friends watching.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise had not seen much of Camilla’s son since he changed <a id="page-57"></a>schools, and even though Jonas and Markus had been friends since the first grade, and promised each other to keep in touch, Jonas had only been to visit him once. Luckily, Markus appeared to have settled in well in his new class.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Can you drop me off at the station?” Louise asked. She got out the bag of decorations from the craft store and put it on the table. She had no idea why Camilla wanted to mess around with making the invitations herself when she had the entire bottom floor to remodel.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Did you make any plans with Mik then?” Camilla asked as they sat in the car, the boys making a racket in the back.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“He was in the middle of a homicide investigation,” Louise repeated. “The woman’s body was still there. To be honest, we didn’t talk much.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“But now you have a reason to call him,” her friend went on, oblivious to her feelings. “You know, there’s nothing like some good sex to lift your spirits.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Please stop,” Louise pleaded, picking up her bag from the floor so she would be ready to jump out in front of the station.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Take care.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">She gave Camilla a quick peck on the cheek before she got out and waved to the boys from the sidewalk.</p>
<p class="space-break">W<span class="small-caps">HEN</span> L<span class="small-caps">OUISE GOT</span> home, Jonas was in his room, playing the guitar. She could hear the music through his closed door, and after taking off her shoes and saying hi to Dina she walked over and knocked to let him know that she was home.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Hey,” he said, looking up.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Do we know if Melvin’s having dinner with us tonight?” she asked. She hadn’t had a chance to call their downstairs neighbor as she’d said she would. On weekdays they ate <a id="page-58"></a>together if neither of them had other plans. The deal was that they would take turns preparing the meal, but in reality Melvin did most of the cooking.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“He’s with Grete. They were going to her friend’s place by the community garden in Dragør. He said we could come along if we want.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I really don’t feel like it,” Louise burst out.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Over the past few months Melvin had been seeing Grete Milling quite often. The two of them had met while Louise was investigating the disappearance of Grete’s grown-up daughter in the Costa del Sol. Her daughter had been murdered, but the two retirees had subsequently stayed in touch, and Louise was pleased that they were enjoying each other’s company. It eased her guilty conscience a little on those occasions when she lacked the energy to be social.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Fine by me,” Jonas said. “I’d rather finish this one anyway so I can put it up on YouTube.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Her birthday present to her son had been a software program that allowed him to upload his original music to his computer and put together his own mixes. He spent several hours every day writing and editing, which was just fine by Louise. She was glad that her teenager was not zoning out in front of video games full of mindless violence or spending entire evenings commenting on his friends’ status updates on Facebook.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Should we just have sandwiches or do you want me to go to the store?” she asked on her way to the kitchen.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Sandwiches,” Jonas answered from his room, where he was once again bent over his guitar.</p>
