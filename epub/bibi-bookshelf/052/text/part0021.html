<p class="noindent1"><span class="dropcap">L</span><span class="small-caps">OUISE CALLED IN</span> sick the next day after tossing and turning most of the night, her head buzzing with bad memories she’d tried so hard to repress and didn’t want to deal with now. After maybe an hour of early-morning sleep, she came to in a daze. She couldn’t face dealing with Eik; forget about Hanne.</p>
<p class="calibre6">After seeing Jonas off to school, she went back to bed and spent most of the day just staring into the white ceiling of her bedroom while concentrating on chasing off the shadows that filled her with memories and painful thoughts.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She was still in bed later that day when Jonas put his key in the lock to let himself in and dropped his book bag on the floor. She was thankful her son was home, and safe. She always worried about him and felt better knowing he was under her roof. But she was not ready to come out of seclusion just yet. She lay quietly, hiding from reality. She heard Jonas’s footsteps and him talking to Dina even though the dog was deaf. She heard <a id="page-131"></a>him take the leash from the hook in the hallway; shortly after, the door slammed behind them.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Then Louise got up and wrote a note. She took a quick shower, got dressed, and was out the door before Jonas got back. With a slightly guilty conscience, she got in the car.</p>
<p class="space-break">A<span class="small-caps">N HOUR LATER</span> she was driving down Main Street in Hvalsø. Just before the church, she signaled and turned down the road toward the rectory. Louise parked the car and turned off the engine. She sat with her eyes closed, completely still for a moment before she opened the door and got out.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She barely looked before crossing Main Street. Ever since moving, she had avoided it when visiting her parents. The fear of running into a familiar face was lodged inside her just as it had been when she’d fled town twenty-one years ago.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The bell in the store clanged as she closed the door behind herself. She let the heavy, humid scent of flowers that filled the small room from floor to ceiling wash over her. From the back room she heard the sounds of conversation and a door being opened.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Coming,” a light voice said. Then the woman came into view.</p>
<p class="calibre6">For a moment they paused and stared at each other in silence before Louise regained enough strength to bend down and grab one of the ready-made bouquets from a bucket on the floor.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Vivi had been in Klaus’s class and although she had put on the pounds since Louise last saw her, she still looked the same. She was one of the girls who had faithfully hung around Big Thomsen and the rest of that gang throughout their youth, Louise recalled, eyes locked on her debit card, which was already in the machine.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-132"></a>They had not exchanged a single word and they still didn’t as Louise accepted the bouquet wrapped in light green paper and exited the store.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She had walked a distance down the sidewalk before she stopped to put her debit card in her wallet and close her purse. Then she crossed the street and walked toward the church.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The gravel on the path crunched under her feet. Louise did not know exactly where Klaus was buried. She had not been there the day of her boyfriend’s funeral. Couldn’t cope with everybody staring at her and people whispering. All she knew was that his grave was somewhere behind the church. Her younger brother had told her.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Mikkel had been there and placed a single red rose on her behalf. Louise had never asked for any details. She did not want to know how many people had shown up or which songs they had sung. All she heard was that Klaus’s younger sister had broken down by the coffin after saying a few words; when Mikkel wanted to recount what she had said, Louise had asked him to stop. The sister had been away at boarding school when it happened but after the funeral she never went back. At least that was what Louise had been told.</p>
<p class="calibre6">As she got to the church, a sense of guilt hung over her once again. She had worked on it and fooled herself into thinking that she had finally managed to put it behind her, but she was never able to rid herself of the shame of the rumor.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre5">Louise bangs for a chopper ride.</em> Her brother was the one who heard it first down by the soccer stadium. At first she had laughed and ignored it. At the time she had been seeing Klaus for almost five years, and he just shook his head and could not even take it seriously. It was only when she started noticing that people whispered about her, at times so loudly that she could not help but hear what they were saying, that it started bothering <a id="page-133"></a>her. But by then the rumor had taken hold and it didn’t matter what she said. No one could answer when she asked them to tell her whom they had seen her ride with. Because the only one she ever rode with was Klaus.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise held her breath for a moment, pulling herself together. The path ahead of her ran straight as an arrow between the low evergreen hedges, which framed the grave sites on both sides of the path. He was somewhere down this way.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She took a few steps but felt her aversion and grief rise up like a shield, blocking her movement. She didn’t want to go down there. It was no more than ten yards but she simply couldn’t.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Back in the small church parking lot, she threw the bouquet in a trash can and hurried away. She walked back to the car, her head bowed and eyes on the pavement, struck by an overwhelming sense of loss. Loss of dignity and loss of love.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Her throat contracted as she ran the last part of the way to the car. She felt as conflicted about this town as ever. It trapped her, yet she couldn’t seem to let it go.</p>
