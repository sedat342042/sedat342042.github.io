<p class="noindent1"><span class="dropcap">I</span> <span class="small-caps">PUT A</span> black marker on the case so the woman is now categorized as deceased in Interpol’s register,” Louise said. She looked at Eik, who was digging into his second sandwich. “But before we release the photo to the media, maybe we should send it to the police districts and to Interpol?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">She waited, unsure of the proper procedure. The case had been transferred to the Search Department once it became apparent to the Holbæk police that they were unable to identify the woman on their own.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Not that it’ll do the other districts much good when we don’t have a name to put on it,” she added.</p>
<p class="calibre6">He shook his head while he quickly finished chewing. “We’ll only be wasting time if we sit around and wait for someone to recognize her by chance. When it comes to unidentified bodies, we usually start by focusing on the area where they were found.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“All right,” Louise said. “It was a forest worker who found <a id="page-23"></a>her on Thursday morning by Avnsø Lake on central Zealand. Does that ring a bell with you?” He shook his head as she rattled off locations: “Hvalsø, Skov Hastrup, Særløse, Ny Tolstrup. There’s a refugee center out there.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Is it down by Køge?” he asked, shaking the crumbs off his black T-shirt.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“No, it’s not near Køge.” She sighed. “It’s between Roskilde and Holbæk. The forest worker was cleaning up along the lakeside when he spotted her. He doesn’t know anything about the deceased and hasn’t noticed any signs of anyone living in the woods.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">She recounted information from the autopsy but fell silent when he held up his hand to stop her. “I need a refill.” He picked up his mug and left. On his return, he asked, “Do we know if the local police searched the area around the slope where she fell?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“The report from the police department in Holbæk says there were clear skid marks in the wet soil at the top,” Louise confirmed. “There had been light rain overnight but they didn’t find any footprints apart from hers.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Maybe she lived in the woods,” he suggested. “Could she be homeless?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise put down the brief police report as someone knocked on the door. Hanne poked her head in; the corners of her mouth turned down, and reminded Louise that she still had not put her name on her cubbyhole. “It’d be nice if things didn’t end up on my desk. They’re piling up!”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Did something arrive for me?” Louise asked. It could be mail forwarded from the Homicide Department. The head of the Negotiation Group had agreed Louise would be spared any new assignments while she worked on getting the new unit up and running, so she wasn’t really expecting anything.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-24"></a>“There’s an invitation to the summer barbecue and the phone directory that I printed for you.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“And you didn’t bring it along when you were stopping by anyway?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I can’t run around delivering mail to everyone in the department,” Hanne replied pointedly.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Oh, but you usually don’t have a problem with that,” Eik chipped in, winking at her.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“You’re a different story,” Hanne cooed.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise stared at the door for a few seconds after Hanne closed it behind her. Then she shook her head.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“She’s not used to competition,” Eik said, leaning back in his chair to fish a wrinkled pack of cigarettes out of his pocket. “Hanne is the queen of the department, the one we all court.” He pulled a flattened smoke from the pack and put it in his mouth while he looked around for a light.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“There’s no smoking in here,” Louise said as he was about to light the cigarette, having found a lighter in the desk drawer.</p>
<p class="calibre6">He cocked a brow and eyed her for a moment before tossing the lighter back down.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise put the police report on the desk.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“As far as the lists of missing persons go,” she continued, “I only went back a month at first. But that just gave us the woman from up in northern Jutland and a young guy from Næstved. So I went back a year, but in that time there were no women within the age group. Finally I went back five years.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise had the lists from the police in a stack in front of her.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“No one fits the description. The big scar would, without a doubt, be listed under distinctive features. So she’s not listed as missing.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Eik still dangled the cigarette from his lips and seemed restless.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-25"></a>“Give me the lists and I’ll take a look at them,” he said, already on his way out the door, lighter in hand.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Just go smoke your damn cigarette so you can focus and we can move on,” she burst out irritably and sat down to wait.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Seven minutes later he returned. “Send me that picture of the woman’s face, would you?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">After examining the photograph he declared, “If she’s Danish, someone must recognize her. That scar is so striking that there’d be no mistaking it if you’d seen her before.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise nodded.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Do you want me to write a description and send the picture to the press? I’ve got a list of the contacts we use for missing person alerts.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Please do,” she exclaimed, happy to see him finally come alive a little. She looked at the clock. “I have an appointment down in Roskilde so I’ll be leaving a bit early today.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">She was still trying to get used to the fact that her dear friend Camilla Lind had moved into her future in-laws’ large manor house in Boserup just outside Roskilde. After his brother died and their sister left her position as chief executive of the family business, Camilla’s boyfriend, Frederik, had decided to leave the United States and move back to Denmark to take over management of Termo-Lux.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Camilla ending up as “lady of the manor” was something Louise had not seen coming. She knew that her friend’s small apartment right by the Frederiksberg Swimming Baths was on the market, and Markus had changed schools about a month ago because Frederik Sachs-Smith had gotten him into some private school in Roskilde. It had all happened so quickly, and now they were getting married, too. Louise had stopped by a craft store to pick up more pearls for the invitations. Camilla insisted on making them herself; Louise knew how important <a id="page-26"></a>all this was to her old friend and confidante, so she promised to bring them down after work, even though she found the whole thing to be a waste of time.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She sighed at the thought, already weary of being dragged into the wedding preparations. It was as if her friend had gone into romantic overdrive.</p>
<p class="space-break">“D<span class="small-caps">ONE</span>!” E<span class="small-caps">IK</span> N<span class="small-caps">ORDSTRØM</span> broke the silence a little later. “The description and photo have been sent out with a notice to contact the Special Search Agency if you recognize the woman or have any idea who she might be.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">He looked expectantly at Louise.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Great,” she complimented. “Have you seen the pictures they took where they found her?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">He shook his head.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise brought them up on her screen and sent them to him.</p>
<p class="calibre6">His furrowed face turned serious as he leaned forward, intently studying the photographs. “My mom had flowered smocks like that. They closed with a bunch of hooks in front, too,” he said. “I think it was the sixties but you would think they hadn’t invented the zipper yet. I didn’t know they still existed.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise contemplated the picture and nodded. From the clothes it did look as if time must have stood still for her.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“How ’bout we drive down and speak to the guy who found her ourselves?” he went on. “We can put a little pressure on him.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I already made plans to do that first thing tomorrow,” Louise said. She briefly wondered whether her temporary partner intended to show up on his own the next day or if she was going to have to pick him up again.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-27"></a>“You go ahead and go to Roskilde,” he said, shutting down his computer and putting on his leather jacket. “I can talk to him. I have nothing else to do now anyway.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise took her eyes off the screen and watched him as he dug the last cigarette out of the pack, which he crumpled up and tossed into the wastebasket.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“It’s not exactly a high-priority case that calls for overtime,” she objected. She guessed that he was the type of person who would come in late and then turn around and add extra hours to his time sheet if he ended up staying past 4 p.m. That wasn’t going to fly with her. “You don’t even know where Avnsø Lake is!”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I’ve got GPS.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Sure, you’ll find your way to the woods but then that’s as far as you’ll get. There’s no coverage once you drive in there.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">She was usually the one to insist on getting things done, she reflected. And she wondered if this could be a sign of her getting old and complacent. <em class="calibre5">No way</em>, she decided, picking up her bag. She may have just turned forty, but she wasn’t ready to be “fat and finished,” as the old Danish saying went. “All right, fine; we’ll go now.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">On their way out they stopped by Hanne’s office. Louise left it to Eik to pick up the key for one of the department’s two cars. When they got downstairs, though, she held out her hand.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I’m driving,” she informed him.</p>
