<p class="noindent1"><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="small-caps">HAT THE HELL</span> are you doing?” Louise yelled when she walked into the office the next morning, her head heavy, and spotted two of the case files from the archives in Roskilde on Eik’s desk.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“It’s just the ones we didn’t finish in Holbæk,” he answered innocently.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“You can’t just remove the case files! That’s Mik’s case! How do you plan to explain that you took them?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Calm down,” he grumbled, straightening up as he opened the top file. “I’ll send them back as soon as we’re done with them.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“You’re not sending them back,” Louise cut in, pointing to the phone. “You’re going to call up Mik and explain to him that the files are on your desk.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Just then Louise’s cell phone started ringing, and she was about to toss it in the drawer when she noticed that it was <a id="page-178"></a>Melvin. For a second she started to worry. It wasn’t like him to call her during her working hours.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Yes,” she answered briefly, turning her back to Eik, who was laying out the old cases across his desk. She pulled out her chair and sat down while her downstairs neighbor informed her that he had just gone to put them down for the community garden lot.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“The house on there isn’t very big,” he said and generously offered to take the smaller room out back so she and Jonas could have the bedroom and the part of the living room that was screened off behind the kitchen. “There’s room for an extra bed.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">So all three of them in 375 square feet, Louise thought, starting to regret having let herself get carried away in her red wine buzz. She had to backpedal but really didn’t feel up to it right now. He sounded so happy.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Let’s talk about it tonight,” she said quickly and promised to stop by downstairs after she got home.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I also found the case files for the two women who went missing that same summer. Check out what one of Lotte Svendsen’s girlfriends said in her deposition,” Eik said as soon as she put down her phone. “ ‘We had been hanging out all day. It was the Whitsun celebration so most of us met up early for the community breakfast down on Main Street.’ ”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Give me that; I want to read it myself,” she said irritably, reaching for the old report.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“ ‘Several of us went home to sleep for a while before meeting back up in the evening for the party in the tent. Then we rode our bikes out to Avnsø Lake and kept partying. I don’t remember if Lotte went swimming, too, but she wanted to leave before the rest of us. Ole had started messing around with Helle, and so Lotte got mad and went to get her bike,’ ” she read out.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-179"></a>After skimming over the rest of the case, she determined that the deposition from Lotte Svendsen’s girlfriend was the most interesting one. The other people who were interviewed hadn’t even noticed that Lotte Svendsen left early to go home.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Nobody had seen her after she left the party in the woods, and it was several days before a forest worker found her bike between the trees a few hundred yards from there. No attempt had been made to hide it; it was just left there, Louise noted, which suggested to the police that she had parked it there voluntarily.</p>
<p class="calibre6">If she had been attacked that close to the others, it seemed most unlikely that nobody would have heard her calling for help. According to most of the people who had been interviewed, it was no secret that Lotte Svendsen had been deeply in love with Ole Thomsen for several years—ever since they left school, in fact, but things never really happened between the two of them. At the time, several people explained that they initially thought her disappearance might have something to do with that.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Big Thomsen had been interviewed as well but according to his deposition, he hadn’t even noticed her being at the lake that evening.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre5">What a jerk</em>, Louise thought. That’s exactly how she remembered that crowd: arrogant and indifferent.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Would it be worth it to talk to the people who used to hang out in the woods back then?” Eik suggested, looking at her questioningly.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Maybe,” she replied, “but I think we should start by focusing on finding the consultant doctor and some of the others who worked at Eliselund back then so we can get an explanation for those death certificates.” She told him about Camilla’s visit to Agnete Eskildsen. “I don’t like thinking about the fact that the rapist might have a connection to Mette.”</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-180"></a>Louise tipped her chin toward the phone on his desk. “You get the information on the employees,” she said, “and I’ll drive to Holbæk and return the two case files that you stole.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“You don’t have to drive there; we’ll just send them in the mail,” he objected. “They don’t even know that they’re missing.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I don’t want to risk them getting lost in the mail,” she declared. “I’m going.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">She was quite happy to get away from the Rathole and from Eik, who had put the phone in his lap, tipped his chair back, and flung his boots up on the desk while punching in the number for Eliselund.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“February 1980,” he repeated, and listened while nodding.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise was holding the case files, her bag on her shoulder, and couldn’t help but smile. She had immediately picked up that Eik had Lillian Johansen—the cranky sourpuss—on the line.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I just need to know who worked at Eliselund at the time,” he continued in a deep and patient voice while shaking a cigarette from the pack with his free hand and lighting it, unconcerned with the fact that Louise was still standing in the doorway.</p>
<p class="space-break">W<span class="small-caps">HEN SHE GOT</span> to Holbæk, Louise left the case files with the front office for the criminal police with instructions that they were to be brought to Mik’s office right away. Then she slunk away before she risked running into anyone she knew. On her way back to the car, Viggo Andersen called and told her that he now intended to look for the doctor who signed the death certificates.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I’m going to get ahold of the Division for the Care of the Mentally Retarded,” he said with an air of commitment. He <a id="page-181"></a>was showing his girls all the attention that had been withheld from them back then.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“We’re already working on finding the persons responsible. Why don’t we agree that I’ll contact you once we get some names?” Louise said. She understood that he felt the need to act, but he would have to wait until they had had a chance to speak with those involved. Instead she suggested that he have a talk with Agnete Eskildsen, who used to work there when the girls were little. “Did you or your family have any acquaintances in the Hvalsø area? Someone who would have known the girls when they were little and knew that they grew up at Eliselund?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">A considerable amount of time passed while he pondered her question, but he finally arrived at the conclusion that they didn’t.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I was too busy working and looking after the girls to have much of a social circle,” he added. “And they were mostly in their own little world and then they were just three years old when they moved away.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“No big deal, it was just a thought anyway,” Louise hurried to say. “You’ll hear from me after we speak with some of the old employees from Eliselund.”</p>
<p class="space-break">W<span class="small-caps">HEN</span> L<span class="small-caps">OUISE REACHED</span> the freeway exit to Hvalsø, she decided to stop by her parents’ place to see if Jonas wanted to come home. She drove down the underpass and was about to take the back way around town out of habit, but then she stopped herself and continued down Main Street instead. When she reached the church, she signaled off and turned into the small parking lot. There were no other cars. She got out of the car and walked through the gate. Keeping up her pace, she continued down the <a id="page-182"></a>path past the church and around the corner to the cemetery in the back. The cemetery was deserted aside from an older man who was watering the graves that faced out toward the inn.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She smelled the freshly cut grass from the lawn surrounding the unmarked graves. She proceeded slowly toward the rearmost paths, where she began reading the names on the headstones, an oppressive feeling growing in her chest. None of these people had died recently.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Twenty-one years had passed. Klaus was buried on September 7, 1990. It was a Friday. Louise remembered because it was exactly one week after they moved into the house. She paused for a moment to gather up courage before continuing to the rearmost path, which ran along the cemetery wall.</p>
<p class="calibre6">His grave was the third one in. The name was cut into black slate, and there was a small heart underneath.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre5">That heart should have been from me</em>, Louise thought sadly and squatted down.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She looked at the two small cemetery vases with fresh flowers. Everything was tidy and neat without being overly groomed, but he wouldn’t have cared for that anyway. Her eyes rested on the wildflowers sown in a cluster and the two evergreen shrubs that gave his little plot a lush appearance.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre5">Someone must come here often since the grave is so neat</em>, she thought, reaching out to touch the fresh flowers in the vases. The leaves were still crisp. Louise let her hand linger for a moment on the stem of the flower while her thoughts traveled back, and she startled when her cell phone started ringing in her pocket.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“There’s been another rape,” Mik started without presenting himself. “The woman’s husband found her when he came home and called an ambulance. They took her to Roskilde.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise stood up in a daze.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-183"></a>“Is she alive?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Yes, and it doesn’t seem like she’s been subjected to the same aggravated violence as we’ve seen in connection with the murder of the child care provider,” he said, adding that he hadn’t personally had a chance to speak with the victim.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“But could it be the same perpetrator?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Without a doubt,” Mik answered.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“What do you know?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“We know that the rapist entered the woman’s home through an open patio door while she was in the bathroom.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Where does she live?” Louise asked, feeling a jitter through her body.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“The postal code is for Hvalsø, but according to her husband, the house is inside the woods a ways,” he explained. “The house has some name or other; I’ve got it written down somewhere. Here it is: Starling House.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Starling House, huh?” Louise remembered it, and the large patio she had seen from the forest road.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Yes, that’s right.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Has the victim said anything?” she asked.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Not yet. I’ve got pretty much all my people out in the area so I’ll have to recall one of the female officers before we can go to Roskilde to interview her,” he answered. They were both well aware that the interview would be more productive with a female interviewer.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I can go talk to her,” Louise quickly suggested but then fell silent when it occurred to her that it may not be the best idea. She might not be able to go through with the interview if the rape victim turned out to be someone she knew.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“You got time?” he asked, jumping at her offer. “For now, all we need to know is whether she can describe the rapist.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I’ll talk to her.” Louise made a quick decision and thought <a id="page-184"></a>of Mette. Right now, even the smallest lead was a potential step toward finding her. She told him that she was in Hvalsø. “I can get there faster than you guys anyway.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Thanks,” he said. “I’ll drive out to the house with the forensic officers then. I’ll let them know that you’re on your way.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise got in the car and threw a last glance at the cemetery, thinking that it hadn’t been quite as hard as she had imagined.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She should have done it years ago.</p>
