<p class="noindent1"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="small-caps">HE HOMICIDE ROOM</span> was at the end of the hallway. This rearmost autopsy room was twice the size of the other bays to allow room for police and forensic officers, but the room was set up the same as the others: with a steel table, a wide sink, and bright lamps.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise took out her Dictaphone and placed it where it could record Flemming’s examination of the body. The entire process was photographed by Åse, who was compiling the materials for investigation at the Center of Forensic Services. The samples that Flemming collected in the process would be passed on to the forensic geneticists upstairs.</p>
<p class="calibre6">While Louise wouldn’t exactly say the woman lying on the table in the middle of the room was dirty, neither would she say she was well groomed. Her hair was overgrown and tangled and her nails long and jagged. Most striking was the large scar <a id="page-10"></a>that covered one cheek and pulled down the eye a little, giving her face a sad expression.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“The dentist was astounded, to put it mildly, when he finished his examination,” Åse said as she lifted her camera. “He said it’s extremely rare for him to see a set of teeth in such a state of neglect. They’re ruined from cavities and very crooked.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Flemming nodded. “She has apparently never had any kind of orthodontics, and there’s severe periodontal disease in the upper part of the mouth,” he said. “She already lost several teeth.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise grabbed a tall stool, which she moved closer as Flemming started the internal examination. The organs had been removed and transferred to a steel tray next to the sink.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“We’re dealing with a full-grown woman but I’m having difficulty assessing her age.” He bent over the body. “As far as the distinctive scar is concerned, I feel certain that it has never been treated. It’s a violent injury from some time back. It may also have been a corrosive burn,” he added, pensively. “There hasn’t been any grafting, and it must have hurt like hell when it happened.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise nodded. That had been her initial thought as well.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“She also has an old scar that could easily date all the way back to her childhood. At one point in time she broke a bone in her left forearm, which wasn’t treated.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">The medical examiner looked up at them as he drew his first conclusion.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“All of this tells me that she has been profoundly neglected throughout her life and that she was probably quite isolated.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise looked at the ruined soles of the woman’s feet and the cuts on her ankles. They clearly showed that she had gone barefoot for a long way.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-11"></a>Flemming turned his eyes back to the woman’s body once more and continued the autopsy in silence for a short while until he noted that in falling down the slope, the deceased had broken seven ribs on her left side.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“There’s about five pints of blood in the left pulmonary cavity,” he announced without looking up. “And the lung is collapsed.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">After rinsing the internal organs and examining them one by one, he straightened up and told Åse that he was finished.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Aside from the broken ribs and the blood in the pulmonary cavity there’s no indication of violence,” he said, rolling off his skintight gloves and throwing them in the trash. “My immediate guess would be that she died of her internal bleeding.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">He paused and thought for a moment before adding: “One detail that may be of interest is that I’m quite convinced the woman had intercourse shortly before her death.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise looked at him in surprise.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I believe there are remnants of semen in the vagina and on the inside of both thighs,” he explained, “but I need to get that confirmed, of course, so I’ll have to wait to get the test results back before I can say for certain. That could take about a week.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">She nodded. It very well could when there was no indication that the death was the result of a crime. She got up and walked back to look at the woman’s disfigured face.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“If I’m right, it could mean that perhaps she wasn’t that lonely after all.” Flemming walked over to call the technicians, letting them know he had finished.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“But still lonely enough that no one has found reason to report her missing despite the fact that she’s been dead almost a week,” Louise said.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-12"></a>She waited while Åse put away her equipment and then they said good-bye to Flemming, who had moved to the computer in the corner to dictate the details to his report.</p>
<p class="calibre6">They left the autopsy room with a nod at the two forensic technicians, who had to close up the body before it was taken back to the cold-storage room in the basement.</p>
