<p class="noindent1"><span class="dropcap">C</span><span class="small-caps">AMILLA STOOD IN</span> the kitchen, arms folded across her chest, and looked out the window. Out in the field, Markus and two of his new friends from school were taking turns riding the new ATV that Frederik had bought for him. She thought the four-wheeler was much too fast for boys their age, but nobody took her seriously when she worried about their safety. Each time they just told her that it was safer than a two-wheel motocross bike—as if that was any comfort. Camilla also did not accept the argument that everything was perfectly all right as long as they only rode it on private property. From what she could tell, an accident could just as well happen in your own field.</p>
<p class="calibre6">While the bike was moving at high speed, Markus stood up from the seat and leaned to the side to make it ride on two wheels before taking a sharp turn to the left. He was <a id="page-125"></a>breaking every agreement they had about driving slowly and carefully; clearly he’d forgotten that she could see him from the kitchen.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Camilla walked back into the rooms where the walls were still peeling and unfinished. Two of them were completely untreated and there was a sour, musty smell.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She opened up the tall windows facing out toward the courtyard. For the first time, she felt like turning her back on her new life.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The minister had just left, their conversation having turned into an argument when she realized that he had only come to see her to talk her out of getting married in the yard. He had insisted that the only appropriate thing would be to have the actual ceremony in Roskilde Cathedral and suggested that she could then have the wedding reception in her backyard.</p>
<p class="calibre6">He didn’t understand that she wanted to keep it informal. Camilla wanted to be surrounded with joy and laughter. She didn’t want an organ or the church choir, which made her think of everything that had happened to her future husband’s family. And when the minister finally confessed that he would like the media attention that the Sachs-Smith wedding would undoubtedly attract, to also benefit the cathedral, Camilla had definitively decided that he would not be marrying her at all.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Hey!” Frederik called from the entrance hall. She had called him right after the minister left.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Hey,” she said wearily, turning her back on the bare walls and cardboard-covered floors.</p>
<p class="calibre6">He walked over and kissed her, and she savored the warmth of his body for a moment. “Now we don’t have a minister either,” she lamented and dropped her hands despairingly.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-126"></a>He held her at arm’s length and smiled. “You sure do scare everyone off.” He kissed her again, running his hands up her back while gently nibbling at her earlobe. “I can go by the parish office later and have a talk with him. Don’t you think we can bring him around?” he whispered as he pulled up her shirt to find her soft skin.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Camilla removed herself from the embrace and took an angry step back. “Like hell you will!” she said, tucking her shirt back in. “I don’t want him to come around. I’m the one who’s mad!”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Come on!” said Frederik. “He married my sister. And he buried our mom and my brother, too. He’s part of the family.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">She could tell he was getting annoyed.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“If you still want to get married in two months, we’re going to need him. He already changed his plans for us and squeezed us into his full schedule,” Frederik reminded her, “so we can be a bit flexible, too.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“It’s not about being flexible. It’s a question of having a wedding that reflects who we are,” she tried. “You just give in and go along whenever there’s the slightest conflict.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I don’t think that’s entirely true,” he continued calmly. “But there’s no reason to make things more difficult than they need to be.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Difficult!” she burst out. “It’s not difficult to get the mayor to marry us instead. We just have to make an appointment. The most important thing is that we feel comfortable and that the day turns out exactly how we want to remember it.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Of course,” he hushed. “But we’re not going to go running to the mayor just because you got carried away by your temper and fired our minister.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Camilla was so furious that tears welled up in her eyes as she turned her back to him and walked away.</p>
<p class="space-break"><a id="page-127"></a>S<span class="small-caps">HE CLOSED THE</span> door behind her and slumped down by her desk. No way was she backing down. Every fiber of her body objected to the idea of a church wedding. That was not at all how she imagined it, and the minister could have just told them from the beginning that it would not be possible. Then she would have looked for another minister. There were plenty of churches in Roskilde. But right now she was mostly angry that she didn’t have Frederik’s support.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She straightened up and tried to force herself to think of something else. Suddenly she realized that she had thought about little else but the wedding since she and Frederik moved in together. She had left several phone calls from her previous editor at the morning paper unanswered, and she had shown no interest in what Terkel Høyer wanted from her.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She folded her hands under her chin and stared out the window, a feeling of emptiness washing over her. Then she closed her eyes and put her head in her hands. She hadn’t even been listening when Louise told her about the missing twin girls. In fact, she hadn’t heard much of what her friend said because she had been so preoccupied with her own problems, mostly needing someone to listen.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She sighed heavily. She remembered something about one of them living off the grid until her death last week, and that the whereabouts of the other sister were unknown.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She heard Frederik calling from the living room that he was going back to the office, but she didn’t answer although she knew he was probably waiting for her to come out. Instead she tried to think of the deceased twin’s name. She opened her laptop, typed “Lisemette Eliselund” in the search field, but quickly saw that there were no results.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-128"></a>Then she logged on to Infomedia and tried searching the newspapers’ database, but again—nothing. Well, obviously the articles had not been electronically saved so far back, she thought, but she’d wanted to give it a shot before calling Louise.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Camilla immediately picked up on her friend’s sullen tone but asked her anyway if she knew the name of the woman who had reacted to the published photograph of Lisemette.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Do you know where she lives?” Camilla asked after writing down the name.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I believe it was somewhere down by Gørlev—but try running a search with her phone number,” Louise answered without asking what her friend planned to do with it.</p>
<p class="calibre6">It wasn’t like her at all, Camilla thought to herself. Louise was usually all ablaze as soon as she showed any interest in one of her cases. It was only after she hung up that Camilla realized that her friend could have been upset.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She did an address search for Agnete Eskildsen and figured that she could easily sell the story—that is, if she was able to crack it.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Can Filip stay for dinner?” Markus called up the stairs.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“No,” Camilla called back without getting up.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Why not?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Because you and I are going out to eat!”</p>
<p class="calibre6">She suddenly craved time with Markus, just the two of them the way things used to be, and she wanted to get out of there before Frederik got back.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“So can’t he come, too?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“No,” she yelled, well aware that her son had grown into enough of a teenager that it could lead to a major argument if he felt offended by her rudeness. “He can stay for dinner tomorrow,” she suggested, offering a deal to keep the peace.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-129"></a>“Fine,” Markus sulked and slammed the door as he went back outside.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She rested her head in her hands for a moment before getting up and going to survey one of the guest rooms. Then she got her duvet and pillow and made up a bed before returning to the office to set up an appointment with Agnete Eskildsen.</p>
<p class="calibre6">At this moment, family life was getting on her last nerve. They could all bite her.</p>
