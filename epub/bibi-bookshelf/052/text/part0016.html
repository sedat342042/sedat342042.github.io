<p class="noindent1"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="small-caps">HEY WERE BOTH</span> quiet as they drove back on the freeway, until Louise’s cell phone started ringing.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“No, don’t bring raw food,” she said after putting the headset on. Camilla was in Copenhagen and had dropped Markus off at home with Jonas. Now she was offering to take care of dinner. “Melvin is making rissoles; I’m sure you’re welcome to join us.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise felt like she needed to shake off the visit to Lisemette’s father before she got back to Frederiksberg if there was to be any chance of her being enjoyable company.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“And who’s Melvin, then?” Eik asked.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise turned off Kalvebod Quay and drove past the central post office without answering.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I was just under the impression that you lived alone with your foster son,” he mumbled and got out his pack of cigarettes so he could sneak a few puffs.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-95"></a>She parked by the curb, trying to refrain from reacting to the fact that he had obviously been checking up on her. She definitely had not told him any of that herself.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Melvin is our downstairs neighbor,” she answered, getting out of the car. “He’s seventy-five, and today is his turn to cook.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“You live in a commune?” he asked with respect in his voice as he tucked his lighter in his pocket.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She laughed and shook her head. “Not at all. We just help each other out to make things run more smoothly. Melvin lends a hand with the practical stuff, and Jonas and I help him keep the loneliness at bay.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Well, no wonder there’s no room for a man in your life.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise stopped. “What makes you say that?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“What?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“That there’s no room for a man in my life? Do people talk about that?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">He shook his head innocently.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Who said that?” she demanded to know. “Was it Hanne?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Oh, stop it, it wasn’t meant as an insult,” he shouted after her as Louise turned her back on him and walked away. She hated being exposed and questioned; hated that Eik knew her private business after only a couple of days.</p>
<p class="space-break">I<span class="small-caps">T WAS LATE</span>, so instead of going back up to the office, she walked over to her bicycle while she called the Department of Forensic Medicine to ask if they had set up an appointment with Lise Andersen’s father.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Actually, he’s already on his way,” Flemming Larsen informed her. He also reported that one of her colleagues from the Search Department had tried to track down the woman’s <a id="page-96"></a>dental records now that they had her civil registration number. “No luck, though,” he lamented. “In fact, they haven’t found anything. It would have been a different story had she been registered as dead within the last ten or fifteen years. Then there’d have been a better chance of the information still being there.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I’m pretty sure he’ll be able to identify her,” Louise said. She asked Flemming to call her once Viggo Andersen had been to see his daughter.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I’ll accompany him to the viewing room myself,” the medical examiner said. “If he’s the least bit unsure, I’ll be able to tell and then I’ll be sure to react.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise thanked him and got on her bike to go home.</p>
<p class="space-break">M<span class="small-caps">ELVIN HAD MADE</span> scalloped peas and carrots fresh from Grete Milling’s greenhouse. Louise smiled at him, appreciating the fact that he went all-out when he was in charge of dinner.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“If only I had a greenhouse like that,” he sighed and put the last rissoles in the pan.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Maybe you could apply for permission to put one up in the yard,” Camilla suggested as she handed him a glass of white wine from a bottle she had brought. “It’s pretty big.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“But that’s not the same,” Melvin mumbled while flipping the breaded meat.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Or you could have your own vegetable garden at my place,” Camilla offered. “There’s plenty of room, that’s for sure. But I’m not going to take care of it for you.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“That’s the whole point of it, though,” he retorted, “unwinding and caring for the things that grow. Nancy was always so good at that.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Since meeting Grete Milling, he had been mentioning his <a id="page-97"></a>late wife less frequently but when he did, his voice always filled with love even though it had felt like forever since they had lived together. For the last several years of her life, Nancy had been in a coma at a nursing home, but Melvin had gone every day to see her.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Will you tell the boys that dinner’s ready?” he asked, nodding toward the closed door to Jonas’s room.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise walked over and knocked. They had been in there since she got home, and Melvin had only seen them when they came out to ask if there were any more Popsicles in the freezer.</p>
<p class="calibre6">There was a draft from the open window. Louise was a bit puzzled. “Are you guys smoking in here?” She walked over to close it.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Markus was sitting on the bed and shook his head indignantly, offended that she would even ask.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Jonas was practically touching his nose to the screen as if on another planet and he clearly was not paying attention.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Yeaaah!” he suddenly shouted, jumping up. “Ten thousand hits! Ten thousand people have listened to my new song!”</p>
<p class="calibre6">He pounded Louise on the shoulder and high-fived his friend on the bed.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Markus got up, and Louise joined them in looking at the YouTube page where Jonas had uploaded some of his own music.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“But they don’t even know you, so how do they find you?” she asked, shaking her head.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Jonas has a crazy-high rating,” Markus said approvingly.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“It’s because the link to the song gets passed around,” Jonas explained. “People who like it share it, and that’s how it spreads.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Holy crap, it keeps going up,” Markus pointed out and sat down in front of the screen. “There’s two more now.”</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-98"></a>“Are you guys coming?” Melvin called from the kitchen.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I put the song on Facebook, too, and yesterday I had over two hundred comments and they were from people from all over the world,” Jonas explained once they were all seated around the table.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise smiled, pleased that Jonas was so absorbed in something that clearly made him happy. There had been a period when he’d been having problems with the other boys at school, who teased him because he’d lost both of his parents. Louise had found it difficult to deal with the cruelty of the kids’ teasing, and Jonas had tried to spare her by keeping it to himself until he ended up in the emergency room with a split eyebrow after a fight in the schoolyard.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Maybe you could play something at my wedding,” Camilla said with a smile.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise appreciated Camilla’s generosity, even if her friend was mostly being polite. She looked forward to being the proud mama when Jonas performed a song or two on the big day.</p>
<p class="space-break">“D<span class="small-caps">O YOU THINK</span> they’re smoking?” Louise asked after dinner when the boys had once again closed the door behind them. She looked at Camilla.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Are you nuts? They’re way too young,” her friend dismissed. “They’re barely teenagers.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise laughed. “What does that have to do with anything?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Isn’t that usually when they start doing things like that?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I don’t think ‘usually’ plays much of a part when you’re that age,” Melvin chipped in, sneaking another half rissole onto his plate. “The whole smoking and drinking thing seems like it just starts when you’re ready. I was twelve when I lit up my first cigarette.”</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-99"></a>“Well, that makes you an excellent role model then,” Louise said, hoping that her neighbor hadn’t been entertaining Jonas with too many stories of his youth.</p>
<p class="space-break">“H<span class="small-caps">OW’S THE REMODELING</span> coming along?” Louise asked once they had cleared the table and were having coffee. Before Melvin went back downstairs, he had left a handful of Quality Street chocolates on the table and extended an invitation from Grete Milling to Louise and Jonas to come along to Dragør that Sunday.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Camilla shrugged and grabbed a piece of chocolate.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Frederik wasn’t exactly happy to hear that I’d fired the workers. He’d prefer everything to run smoothly of course, but I’m simply not going to put up with people blowing off a deal,” she huffed. “Just because they think they’ve got you cornered and you need the job finished no matter how they behave.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Have you found someone else to take over?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Camilla shook her head.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“The ones we talked to have an eight-week waiting list—minimum.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“So I guess you’ll have to rehire the other ones so they can finish,” Louise said with a small smile.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Are you crazy? No way! I won’t let them set foot in my house again,” Camilla sputtered. “If we can’t find anyone else to do the work, I’ll put up a tent in the yard. Or hire some Polacks. They don’t spend half their working hours reading the paper and drinking Coke, either.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise couldn’t help but laugh. “That’ll look great on the front page when it’s revealed that the Sachs-Smith family uses underpaid labor.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“We don’t have to underpay them just because they’re <a id="page-100"></a>foreigners,” her friend snapped irritably. Then she cracked a smile herself when she said that she was actually considering overpaying them.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She picked out another chocolate wrapped in glittery red foil.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“But it’s all a mess,” she admitted, folding the foil into a tiny square. “The contractor—the guy from Hvalsø—came up the same evening that I’d fired them to hand over a huge bill, which also included all of the work they hadn’t done. I guess he had no problem finding the time for that,” she said, shaking her head.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Camilla finished her coffee and got up to gather up her things. She called for Markus and told him it was time to go.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I’m in the bathroom,” he called back.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“You could just postpone the wedding. That way you’d have more time to get everything in place,” Louise suggested.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“We could, but I don’t want to. If I’m getting married, it has to be this summer. I’m crazy about him. I’ve never felt such a sense of belonging with someone as I do with him,” she declared. “We’re going to have a big, amazing summer wedding, dancing around barefoot in the yard and spending our wedding night on a mattress beneath the apple trees with candlelight and plenty of champagne.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">In the beginning Louise had considered the relationship between her friend and Frederik Sachs-Smith a passing fling, but it seemed that Camilla had found the love of her life. It would be interesting to see how two such different lives could be combined, she thought. Her friend, the journalist, who had lived in a two-bedroom apartment in the city and had always taken care of herself and devoted herself to her own interests. And the rich guy who had sat on the deck by his pool in California, writing his film scripts and never wanting for anything. <a id="page-101"></a>In addition to the family money from Termo-Lux, he had built a considerable fortune by investing wisely, and he had been a bachelor until Camilla entered the picture.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Markus’s shouting roused Louise from her thoughts. She could only hope her friend knew exactly what she was doing.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Are you coming?” Markus demanded of his mother from the entrance hall.</p>
