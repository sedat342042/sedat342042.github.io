<p class="noindent1"><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="small-caps">T’S BEEN SO</span> long now,” the woman on the phone began after Louise picked up the line.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“But you recognize the person in the photograph?” Louise asked quickly, to help her get started.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Yes, I’m sure I do,” she said. “I once knew a little girl whose face became disfigured like that. I think I also recognize the features on the other side of her face.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Then I’m glad you called.” Louise asked the woman for her name and phone number.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Agnete Eskildsen,” she said, adding that she lived on Hallenslev Street in Gørlev.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“And you’ve crossed paths with the woman we’re looking for?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Yes. Absolutely. Her name is Lisemette.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise asked Agnete Eskildsen to tell her what she knew.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Well, back then she was just a little girl,” she started. “I’ve <a id="page-66"></a>just been trying to count the years. Lisemette must have come to Eliselund around 1965. I remember because I myself was on D back then, and that was the section for the little ones. The children were around three years old.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Eliselund?” Louise interrupted as she noted that the deceased would have been born around 1962. “What’s that?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Why, it was a home for the retarded,” Agnete Eskildsen explained. “They’re called mentally disabled now, of course, but that’s what they were called back then. It’s just outside Ringsted. I worked there as a care assistant.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">She seemed to be thinking.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I can’t remember exactly anymore what the area is called, but there’s a pretty big lake that the institution was facing. You should be able to find it if you have a map.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“So she’d been put in a home for the mentally handicapped,” Louise confirmed. That was consistent with the results of the brain scan that Flemming had done. “Do you remember anything about her parents? Were they locals?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I’m afraid I don’t recall.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“We would really like to find her next of kin,” Louise explained to emphasize the importance of the woman thinking carefully.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The line was quiet, and Louise assumed that Agnete Eskildsen was probing her memory. But when the woman finally spoke again, her tone was a little sharper.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I’m sure you understand,” she said, “that many children like that did not have any contact with their parents once they’d been handed over to us. Several of them never saw their parents again so we didn’t necessarily know the names of their relatives. They were called ‘forgotten children.’ ”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“But surely their families didn’t write them off just because they’d been put in an institution?” Louise objected.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-67"></a>“Quite a few did.” Agnete Eskildsen explained that many parents preferred to hide or even forget the fact that they had a “flawed” child. “They didn’t want to visit the home. But there were also times when the parents were advised to break their contact with the child because their visitation led to nothing but trouble. The children became agitated and upset when their mothers and fathers left, so it was best for everyone if there was no contact.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I see,” Louise said, trying to swallow her disgust. What Agnete Eskildsen was telling her sounded completely inhumane. She knew it happened every day—she’d seen enough horror on the job—but could hardly accept the idea that any parent would abandon a child merely because he or she did not live up to expectations.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Breaking the silence, the woman seemed defensive as she went on. “I know it sounds terrible now, but that’s just how it was back then.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Yes, right. So the girl had no contact with her parents?” Louise asked, her composure regained.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I’m not sure exactly,” Agnete Eskildsen admitted. “But as I recall, she never had any visitors. I could be wrong.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">She fell silent for a moment.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Do you remember her last name?” Louise asked.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“No, sorry.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“But someone must have known the names of her parents?” Louise tried, thinking of the Care Division or the facility supervisor.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Yes,” Agnete Eskildsen conceded. “It was in the records, of course, but that wasn’t something the staff paid much attention to.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“So there are records?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Sure, those kinds of things are always archived, but I <a id="page-68"></a>don’t know if the old files are still accessible. Back in my day, they were stored in the basement. We had records dating all the way back to 1860, when the first patients were admitted to Eliselund. Several of the really old case files are probably exhibited in the museum now.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“The museum?” Louise repeated.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Yes,” the woman replied as if annoyed that Louise knew nothing of the place at all. “When the Division for the Care of the Mentally Retarded ceased to exist in 1980, much of Eliselund closed down. Only the main building is still in use today, and it’s been set up as a day treatment center for the mentally disabled. Many of the other buildings ended up empty, but I read somewhere that the old washhouse has been converted to a museum with some of the devices that were used in the place through the years. I remember there was a Utica crib, and I’m sure that’s been brought over. Of course it’s been a long time now since the mad ones got locked up like that, thank God.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I’m not really sure what a Utica crib is,” Louise admitted.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“It’s a wooden box, maybe ten square feet, that was used to confine people. You always kept the worst ones locked up to have some peace. We used straitjackets and belts as well but at our place at least they were indoors in winter. The Utica cribs were outside or in the barn.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“But you think I’ll be able to find the old records down there?” Louise asked, shaken by the casual tone with which Agnete Eskildsen spoke.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Someone at the day center will probably be able to help,” she suggested. “I’m thinking you’ll find someone there in the main building all week. But what do I know? It’s been more than forty years since I stepped foot in the place. I just felt like I had to reach out when I saw that picture of little Lisemette.”</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-69"></a>After thanking Agnete Eskildsen once more for reacting to the police alert, Louise looked up Eliselund online.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Day Center Eliselund, West Zealand County, it said, followed by a phone number. Louise dialed and waited while a mechanical voice offered choices: the business hours of the day center, how to contact a client, and which number to press to get in touch with the main office. She selected the last option and her call was picked up right away by a Lillian Johansen.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Records like that are very sensitive, of course, so we can’t just hand them over,” the woman said curtly after Louise explained who she was and why she was calling.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“We’re not asking you to hand over the files,” Louise quickly pointed out. “We’d just like to see them—”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“All records are protected by the Privacy Act,” the woman cut in.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise tried again. She had just been so excited about possibly moving a step closer to an identification, and now this petty official was going to stand in her way.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“We’re trying to identify a dead woman. We received a tip from someone who recognizes her, who told us that the deceased lived at Eliselund as a child,” Louise elaborated. “All I’m asking is if someone from your staff will go and see if her file is still there and give us a civil registration number or the names of the woman’s parents so we can get in touch with her next of kin.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I’m afraid that’s not possible,” the woman stated bluntly.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I guess I’ll have to get a warrant then.” Louise sighed, aware that she had missed her opportunity to talk her way through the bureaucratic wall. “But maybe you can tell me if the old records are still kept on site?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Yes, of course. It’s not like we throw anything away,” the woman answered pointedly.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-70"></a>Following this minimal opening, Louise quickly assessed that it would be worth it to give it another try, now that she had confirmed that the records were accessible.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“But then I’d just like to ask you,” she tried again, “if someone could please go down to the archives and check the old patient records to see if a girl lived there by the name of Lisemette. She was born around 1962.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Anyone could call and ask for something like that,” was her reply, and Louise was about to lose what was left of her patience when the woman added that the police might bother to show up in person for starters. “Then you can explain to us exactly who it is you’re looking for.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I’m coming down,” Louise quickly decided. “Would there happen to be anybody I can talk to who worked at Eliselund in the mid-sixties?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“No, but we’ve got the yearbooks. They have the names and pictures of everyone who lived here during that period.”</p>
<p class="space-break">L<span class="small-caps">OUISE QUICKLY WROTE</span> down the address and ended the conversation.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Let’s go,” she said as Eik came through the door, holding a pastry in his hand. “In all likelihood, the woman’s name is Lisemette and she was placed in a home for the mentally disabled outside of Ringsted as a child. It’s closed down now but they’ve got all the records. If you’ve got nothing else, I think we should drive down and have a look at the yearbooks to see if we can find out if it’s her. Maybe then we can find her next of kin as well.”</p>
