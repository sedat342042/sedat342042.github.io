<p class="noindent1"><span class="dropcap">S</span><span class="small-caps">IRENS SOUNDED THROUGH</span> the quiet of the woods long before the emergency responders came into view. Louise assumed that it was mostly to give her notice that they were getting close so she would be ready to show the way.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She got up from the stump and waved as the ambulance appeared over the hill a moment later. “Go straight about half a mile and then take a left,” she instructed them.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise was about to walk back when a police car pulled up, stopping next to her. She took a step back in surprise when she noticed Mik Rasmussen behind the wheel. She hadn’t seen him in a long time—not, in fact, since he had ended their relationship.</p>
<p class="calibre6">He had screamed, calling her names, bringing up past issues both slight and egregious, accusing her of all kinds of terrible things because she couldn’t, or wouldn’t, commit.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She was going to die alone and he didn’t even really feel <a id="page-38"></a>sorry for her, he had yelled. The words had kept resurfacing every time she thought of him, so gradually she had forced herself to stop.</p>
<p class="calibre6">There was no doubt in Louise’s mind that he had meant every word, and on those rare occasions when she opened up that place inside herself where she was most vulnerable, she could sense her own fear that he might turn out to be right. Still, it was the result of her decision, years earlier, that she wasn’t going to make promises to any romantic partner. That she wasn’t going to rely on anyone so heavily that she could get so deeply hurt again.</p>
<p class="calibre6">They had met in 2007 while she was “on loan” to the Mobile Task Force to assist the Holbæk Police Department in solving a case. They had shared an office, and at first she had seen the lanky local deputy as more awkward than charming. But then he had invited her to go kayaking and she had gratefully accepted the chance at a little diversion from the case as well as the station hotel in which she and her task force colleagues had been accommodated. They’d ended up drinking Irish coffee at his place. One evening led to another, and they saw each other for two years. He called it a relationship but to her it wasn’t quite as serious.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Hi,” she said, pushing away her thoughts. She gave a quick nod to the female colleague sitting next to him. She noticed that her own voice was a few degrees too cool and professional as she shared with them that the slain woman was possibly a child care provider or nursery teacher who had taken the children out for a walk.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“And the kids—are they still down there?” Mik asked, pointing ahead toward the lake.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“They’re sleeping but my colleague is with them.” Louise added that they were probably both thirsty and hungry.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-39"></a>Deep in thought, she stood for a moment and watched the car and then the forensic officers’ blue van drive by.</p>
<p class="space-break">E<span class="small-caps">IK WAS SITTING</span> on the bench, talking to a male colleague from Holbæk, when Louise returned. The children were still sleeping on the ground. The area to his right was being cordoned off, and another police car came down the forest road.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“We heard the kids,” Eik explained. There was dirt on his pants, and his T-shirt was still wet on the shoulder where the boy had cried. “It was probably five, ten minutes before Louise found her.” He turned to her. “Isn’t that about right?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise nodded and watched as Mik walked back from where the body was. She noticed that the stroller had been picked up.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Her name is Karin Lund,” he told them as he got to the bench, the woman’s wallet in hand. “She lives on Stokkebo Road. Does that ring a bell?” He looked at Louise.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She thought for a moment then shook her head. Another road led to the camping cabin—that might be it, but she wasn’t sure.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“My guess is that you need to continue straight on from here and then stay left when the road forks,” she explained as she pointed up behind them. “There’s a big parking lot at the end of the forest road that runs over there. Stokkebo Road could be the gravel road that continues out of the woods.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">She couldn’t recall any other entrances into the woods within such a short distance.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“There are some houses there at least,” she added.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The forensic officers had begun searching the area around the body for evidence. The stroller had been pushed away from the path a little. For a moment Louise was struck by the intense <a id="page-40"></a>concentration that always descended over a new crime scene. Everyone was working on their assignment, and nothing could be overlooked.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Today she just wasn’t part of the team.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“We need to take the kids back to the address,” Mik said to his female colleague.</p>
<p class="calibre6">His leadership and way of assigning tasks seemed relaxed and natural. Though this was the first time Louise was working with him as he headed an investigation, Jonas had recently told her that Mik had been promoted. They still kept in touch. And shared Dina.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The yellow Lab was actually Mik’s dog, but after Jonas lost his father and moved in with Louise, Mik had offered him the puppy. And she knew that very few twelve-year-olds would be able to turn down an offer like that. Nonetheless, she’d been furious. Because they had failed to consult her, and she had no plans whatsoever of being tied down by a dog needing food and walks at regular intervals throughout the day.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Now Mik walked over and stood beside her. “I was a bit puzzled when I saw that the dispatcher had put you down as the person who found her.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I should have notified you guys that we were driving down here,” she apologized. It was standard procedure to check in when conducting investigations in other police districts even when they were the ones who had asked for assistance. “There was an accident out here last week,” she went on, telling him that they had come to see the place where the woman had fallen to her death. “And then we’re going to talk to the guy who found her.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">He told her that he was the one who had passed on the case to them.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Could the two cases be connected?” Louise asked.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-41"></a>Mik shook his head. “There’s no indication that the woman from last week was the victim of a crime. We brought the dogs out here to search the area but they didn’t come up with a thing. Of course we shouldn’t rule out anything but the autopsy shows that she died from the injuries she sustained in the fall, and her footprints were the only ones by the edge. Did you find out her identity?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Not yet, but we’re working on it.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">She was happy to see him but could tell that whatever had existed between them was now gone. In exchange, no anger remained, either; only the camaraderie and the professional relationship, which suited her just fine. It suddenly seemed very natural to be standing there, talking as colleagues. Louise smiled at him.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“It’s good to see you,” she whispered before anyone else could overhear. Eik had left the children in the care of the female officer and was now leaning against a tree, smoking a cigarette.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Have you settled into your new position?” he asked.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She automatically started to nod but then caught herself. “Not really,” she admitted. “But I’m sure it’s just teething troubles.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">She sometimes experienced pangs—she’d miss Mik, then snap out of it quickly, realizing it had needed to end and she was far better off without him. Given the familial ties that had grown between them, she’d felt a void after the breakup. Of course she had Jonas and Melvin—their retired neighbor in the downstairs apartment, who loved to spoil them a little and cook dinner when Louise did not make it home in time. But that still left the nights. And Louise just had to accept the fact that she was the kind of person willing to give up sex if it meant also giving up the pressure of having to be something for someone else.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-42"></a>“Do you need us for anything else?” she asked, signaling to Eik that they ought to be moving on. “We haven’t been to the slope yet and we still need to speak with the forest worker.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Not at the moment, I don’t think,” Mik answered. “I don’t suppose you saw anything when you drove in here?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise shook her head. “Not until we found the kids.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">The little ones were being placed in the backseat of the police car. The girl whimpered, the volume rising when the officer tried to buckle the seat belt around her slight body. The other two seemed to have gone into hibernation—they let themselves be buckled in without any objections.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“We’ll take the back way,” Louise decided, pointing toward the slope and the lakeside below. She stood for a moment and watched the police car drive away. She actually felt more like sticking around to follow the work.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Coming,” Eik answered, making sure that his cigarette was out before shoving the butt in his pocket.</p>
