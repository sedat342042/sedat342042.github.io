<p class="noindent1"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="small-caps">HE SMALL COMMUNITY</span> gardens were so tightly spaced that it was practically like having dinner with the neighbors, Louise thought as she got up to clear the patio table. She had to concede, though, that Grete Milling’s friend’s small, black-painted wooden alcove and the garden had a calming effect on her. She still felt guilty about playing hooky from work and ditching on Jonas, even though he hadn’t noticed. She was shocked to discover that the past continued to have such a hold on her.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She put the salad bowl on top of the stack of plates and carried everything into the small kitchen area behind the living room.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Melvin was making coffee the old-fashioned way on the stove, and the two older ladies were rinsing the dishes. Everything was a bit too tight but sufficiently relaxed that it wasn’t really an issue, Louise noted, suddenly enjoying having people <a id="page-142"></a>around to drown out the silence that had overcome her since she fled the cemetery. On her way home in the car, she had felt so empty and ashamed that she couldn’t even manage to put some flowers on Klaus’s grave.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“You’ll have to remind me if you take sugar?” Grete said, looking at her questioningly.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise shook her head and replied that just milk would do fine.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She hadn’t mentioned her visit to Hvalsø. When Melvin asked if they wanted to go to the community gardens for dinner, all she wanted to do was get back into her bed and pull the covers over her head. But Jonas wanted to go; he’d been there a couple of times and loved it. So, to make her son happy, and keep herself even, Louise decided to join in. Jonas took off right after dinner to see some friends he’d made there the last time.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Melvin handed Louise a blanket and swatted a couple of mosquitoes off his arm. They had agreed that they could sit outside a little longer as long as they bundled up.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Do you think Jonas is smoking?” she asked after they sat down.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Almost absurdly, she hoped that he would say yes because then she would have a concrete reason to focus her thoughts on something other than herself.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Melvin shook his head and smiled. “Right now that boy has only one thing on his mind,” he said, “and that’s his music. If he were smoking, he would have been doing it with Markus the other day because that kid smokes like a chimney and has for a while.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise looked at him with astonishment. “Why didn’t you say something?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Her downstairs neighbor hesitated for a moment before answering. “I think the kids should be allowed a little privacy,” <a id="page-143"></a>he finally said. “They’re about that age when it becomes quite natural to have little secrets.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“But Melvin, you have to tell me when you find out stuff like that!” Louise said. For once she felt resentful of her neighbor.</p>
<p class="calibre6">They heard Jonas and his friends approaching on the garden path, and Melvin lowered his voice.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Didn’t you keep any secrets from your parents when you were that age?” he asked.</p>
<p class="calibre6">About to shake her head, Louise stopped herself. When she was fourteen, she and her friends hid Martinis in the bushes outside the community parties at the local sports center. And then hadn’t she lit up her own first cigarette down by the old gravel pit when she was in the sixth grade? As images from her years in Hvalsø flooded her mind, she stood up as if she could shake them off.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“My advice to you is that you give the boy a little space if you want to hold on to him. If things get too suffocating, he’ll only pull away and live his own life.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I’m cold,” said Jonas, who returned after saying good-bye to his friends and took a seat next to Melvin.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise handed him her blanket and noted that it was getting dark already. They’d better get going. She was still shaken by Melvin’s disclosure. She would have to talk to Camilla about it, but she wanted her friend to have the chance to enjoy her wedding first.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Melvin and Grete had promised Grete’s girlfriend to return the next day to help her paint the fence facing the path. It was Louise’s understanding that it had to be done by June 1 or you would be setting yourself up for conflict with the other garden owners. Melvin had already gotten involved with several of the other members of the garden association and had promised to <a id="page-144"></a>come help out for the work weekend as well because the common areas needed cleaning up.</p>
<p class="calibre6">He was completely hooked on the whole community garden life, Louise thought, watching him get up and walk over to test the soil of a small raised bed by the hedge along the neighboring lot.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I think I might have a temperature,” Jonas mumbled, feeling his forehead.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise looked at him. She worried about him feeling anxious and sick as a reaction to her skipping work and acting depressive.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“You’ll have to go downstairs to Melvin’s if you’re going to stay home from school tomorrow,” she said as the four of them walked to the car together.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Hrhhmm,” Melvin cleared his throat. “I kind of figured on borrowing a mattress in Dragør.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise smiled; she found it sweet that Melvin still had a hard time saying he planned to spend the night with Grete.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“You know—because we’ve got an early start out in the garden tomorrow,” he tried to explain himself.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I can take care of myself,” Jonas cut in, and Louise thought that it might not even be something that would last until the next day after all. The boys had been running around in short sleeves, and maybe they had just gotten chilled. Maybe it was a case of nerves he could sleep off.</p>
