<p class="noindent1"><span class="dropcap">C</span><span class="small-caps">AMILLA HAD SLEPT</span> in Jonas’s room. Her head felt heavy from all the wine and she hadn’t even registered when Louise left. It was after ten before she got up to walk Dina. Then she sat in Louise’s kitchen, staring at the wall.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She regretted the fight and all the trouble that had come from her insisting on doing things her way. She regretted getting so angry with the workers and kicking them out before they had finished, and that her stubbornness had caused her to reject the minister.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She reached the conclusion that she would have to apologize. Not to the minister—no way—and not to the workers. But to Frederik.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Rushing from Louise’s house, her thoughts swirling, she got into her car and took off. By the time she signaled off toward Roskilde an hour later, her anger had disappeared and she was shocked that she had gone so far as to call off the whole thing.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-196"></a>As she approached Boserup and caught a glimpse of the gleaming tile roof of the manor house, she slowed down. Suddenly it all seemed so difficult. She hadn’t called Frederik to let him know she was on her way home, and now she was unsure of how to go about it. They had never had a falling-out before—not to the point of doors slamming.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Camilla pulled over and turned off the engine while she looked down the driveway lined with old, gnarled trees on both sides. But she couldn’t pull up to the house; her hand would not turn the wheel.</p>
<p class="space-break">I<span class="small-caps">T WAS ONLY</span> when she was driving down the long, straight highway past Osted that it occurred to Camilla that she might not get much out of showing up at Eliselund without an appointment. She decided to give it a try anyway, though, and turned up the radio when Beyoncé came on. She felt something unwinding inside as she began to sing along.</p>
<p class="calibre6">As she continued toward Eliselund, she finally felt like she was on home turf. If she knew anything it was how to kick down doors. She might not know how to act among the upper classes but as a journalist, she knew how to get her story and get people to talk.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I was told that my mother worked as the director here before the institution closed,” she lied effortlessly as she sat in the office across from an older lady with gray hair twenty minutes later. She hurried to explain that her parents had divorced when she was very young. “I grew up in Birmingham, England, with my father but he died last year so now I’ve returned to Denmark with my husband and our son.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">When she had parked the car outside in the courtyard surrounded with the large, white buildings, a handicapped-accessible van had been parked there and two assistants were lifting a big <a id="page-197"></a>boy inside while the driver folded up his wheelchair and put it in the back.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Camilla waited in the car until they drove off. There were other people in the van as well; he was the last one they put in. The two assistants waved good-bye, and it wasn’t until the van left the courtyard that one of them walked over to ask if she was there to pick up Sofie.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“No,” Camilla answered in confusion, but then she had quickly collected herself and asked if they were closing up for the day.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Just about,” the woman said. “The last few will be picked up within the next half hour or so and then there’s always a bit of cleanup and things to take care of. But if you’ve come to speak with the enrollment office, that’s not here, you know.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“N-no,” Camilla quickly said and then took a gamble: “I’m actually here on a very private errand,” she began. “A few days ago, I spoke with a woman named Agnete Eskildsen. She used to work here, and she was the one who suggested that I drive down here to see if perhaps you could help me find my mother. But maybe you’re busy. Is this a bad time?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Oh, I don’t think we’re that busy,” the woman had said and asked her to come along.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The other assistant had turned around in the doorway. “So, are we closing up or what?” she asked sullenly.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“It’s all right, Lillian,” said the gray-haired woman overbearingly. “I can close up today. You go ahead and go home.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">She put her hand on Camilla’s shoulder as she directed her through the large hall to signal that she was welcome to come inside.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Some people are such busybodies,” she mumbled as she led the way to the office and held the door open for her guest. “So you know Agnete?”</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-198"></a>She smiled and lightly nodded.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Sure is a small world. She worked here years ago, before I started. We finished our degrees in occupational therapy together. It was her second degree, you know, and even though she’s probably ten or fifteen years older than me, we always got on well.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Camilla merely smiled.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Is her husband still alive?” the other woman asked. Camilla shook her head, hoping that there wouldn’t be questions that might reveal how briefly she’d known Agnete Eskildsen.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I’m sorry,” the woman said suddenly. “I never introduced myself. My name is Lone Friis. In fact, it was Nete who suggested that I apply here back when the day center was starting up. She wasn’t interested in coming back to Eliselund herself, even though a lot has changed since she was a patient care assistant here. I never really understood her aversion to the place.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">She laughed warmly.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“And I’ve been here ever since, so I really have a lot to thank my old girlfriend for.” She motioned toward the chair opposite hers by the desk. “It almost sounds like you’re doing your own private version of that TV show <em class="calibre5">The Locator</em>,” Lone Friis exclaimed after sitting down. “It’s so exciting. I hope I can help. What’s your mom’s name?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Camilla should have seen that coming. Of course she was going to ask that. For a moment she completely blanked as she tried desperately to remember what Agnete Eskildsen had told her about the director of the place.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“She took back her maiden name after she and my father divorced,” she said, stalling for time while digging frantically for a first name. But either the former patient care assistant hadn’t mentioned it, or she hadn’t been paying attention.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-199"></a>Lone Friis was smiling patiently but the silence was beginning to seem strange.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Her name is Parkov,” Camilla said, feeling relieved that her brain was working again. “Or at least it was,” she rambled on while hoping that it didn’t seem too weird for her to only know her mother by her last name.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Bodil Parkov is your mother?” the woman asked with surprise; she appeared not to register Camilla’s hesitation. She cocked her head while looking at her guest with interest as if searching for recognizable features. Then she straightened herself up a little. “Well, not that I know her personally but she is a bit of a name around here, you know. She was the first female director of the institution.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“And was she here until it closed?” Camilla asked.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Lone Friis hesitated. “Close to it, at least,” she said in a way that made Camilla suspect something might have happened toward the end to put her out the door before the rest of the institution staff. “It was actually only a few weeks ago that we were talking about what became of her after she left. But it shouldn’t be too hard to find out.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“How come you were talking about her?” Camilla asked curiously, thinking that it definitely couldn’t have been in connection with Louise’s attempt to find Lisemette’s family—that was too recent.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“They’re looking to hire a new director at the Andersvænge center this fall, and someone brought up her name as a possible candidate. But it seems to me that she must be long retired by now.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">There was a quick knock at the door and Lillian walked in wearing a light windbreaker and holding a bike helmet.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I locked both of the back rooms and canceled the fruit <a id="page-200"></a>delivery for tomorrow,” she said while Camilla stared straight ahead.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Great, I’ll take care of the rest then,” Lone Friis replied. “But listen to this.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">She motioned for her sullen colleague to come in.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“This is Bodil Parkov’s daughter, who has come to learn a little about her mother from back when she was the director here at Eliselund.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Camilla tightened her grip around the armrest of the chair while she forced herself to smile and look at Lone’s colleague.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Lillian tilted her head back a little as she contemplated Camilla. “You’re Parkov’s daughter?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Oh, that’s right,” Lone Friis exclaimed, ignoring her colleague’s undisguised disapproval of her speaking with a stranger. “You were here back then. I completely forgot.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Camilla winced a little as she watched her entire fabricated story fall apart.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Lone Friis got up to go see off the last children. “What can you tell Camilla about her mother? The two of them have lost touch.” Lone excused herself, leaving Lillian and Camilla alone.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Parkov didn’t have any children,” Lillian snarled, still standing in the doorway. “That’s how she was able to spend all of her time down here and make the rest of us do the same.” She stared at Camilla. “I don’t know who you are or what you’ve come to dig up. But I can tell you one thing that I’ll stand by no matter who’s asking: A lot of people would have been better off if Bodil Parkov had never set foot at Eliselund.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">A car honked outside and they heard footsteps running down the hall. Lillian turned around and left, and Camilla wiped her clammy hands on the thin fabric of her skirt. She had stretched her made-up story too far.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-201"></a>She quickly got to her feet and grabbed her purse but stopped as Lillian stepped back into the doorway, blocking her way.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Get in your car and leave. We’re not interested in people who snoop around,” she hissed.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“You knew Lise and Mette?” Camilla observed and decided to drop the story about her missing mother. “You worked here. What happened the day they died?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Lillian turned her back to her and walked out to the courtyard where three children were throwing their bags into the trunk of the car.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Who signed the death certificates?” Camilla called after her.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I don’t know anything about that,” Lillian answered dismissively. She started walking off with her bike but just then, the car with the children drove up and she had to stop to let it through the gate first.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Camilla caught up to her and grabbed her arm.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Tell me what happened. You must have talked about it.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Why don’t you ask Bodil Parkov? She would be the one to know.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Lillian tore herself away and pushed off with her foot to get the bike going.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Don’t mind Lillian,” Lone Friis said as she walked across the courtyard. “She has a hard time with people from the outside. She gave me the silent treatment all last week because I allowed the police access to our archives. She has a hard time making the distinction between personally sensitive information and common sense.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Camilla forced herself to smile even though every fiber in her body was trembling to get going. Lone Friis did not appear to have witnessed her scene with Lillian. She had been preoccupied with getting the children sent off, Camilla thought, and <a id="page-202"></a>started walking toward her car. There she thanked the older woman while she opened the driver’s door.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Well, I’m afraid it wasn’t much help,” Lone Friis lamented as the wind tussled her hair. “Wasn’t your grandfather a merchant—and quite wealthy at that? At least that’s what they said that one day when we were talking. It was unusual that your mother went into service at such a young age instead of finishing school since the family had money. But maybe that was all just lunchroom gossip,” she apologized. “You can probably read about that in <em class="calibre5">Krak’s Blue Book</em>,” she offered, referring to the who’s who of Denmark. “When we were talking about her and the job at Andersvænge, someone went and looked up your mother to find out how old she is.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“She’s in the <em class="calibre5">Blue Book</em>?” Camilla asked, now sitting in the car with her window rolled down.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Lone Friis nodded. “But Lillian is right!” she realized. “Mrs. Tønnesen also mentioned that Parkov never had any children.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Camilla started the car just as Lone Friis took a step forward, looking at her with confusion through the rolled-down window.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She shot her a stiff smile and pushed the button to close the window.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“What did you say your name was?” Lone Friis called as Camilla started backing up.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Her heart was pounding and the dust kicked up behind the car as she sped out of the courtyard, leaving Eliselund behind in a grayish-brown fog.</p>
