<p class="noindent1"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="small-caps">HE WARM</span> M<span class="small-caps">AY</span> sun had turned the roadsides lush and green, and the yellow dandelions had finished flowering and transformed into fuzzy gray spheres. Every corner was drenched in idyll as they rounded a turn in the road lined by a couple of thatched timber-frame houses and horses grazing right by the road. Ahead of them was a tree-lined avenue, more than a mile long and winding through fields running down toward Haraldsted Lake. The drive from the main road had almost made Louise forget their reason for being there. The sky was clear and the area was divinely beautiful. The road curved one last time before it descended toward the water, bringing Eliselund into view.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The closed-down white buildings of the institution stood out like abandoned giants. The large structures formed a square around a courtyard in the center with several smaller buildings behind them. It must have all been enclosed by a tall <a id="page-72"></a>wall, Louise thought, stopping on the hilltop to take in the old home. The remains of the peeling brickwork still bounded the area.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Cars were parked on one side of the courtyard, and from the hilltop it was easy to see which building housed the day center. The main building was freshly limed and the plinth glistened black, in sharp contrast with the rest of the buildings, which appeared to be abandoned.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise drove slowly down the hill.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“At least she grew up in beautiful surroundings,” Eik noted as they continued through a gate that reminded Louise of Vestre Prison. It was the same kind of impressive red-brick arch; less pronounced, but knowing what had once been here it was nonetheless reminiscent of entering a prison.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Yes,” she conceded as she pulled in to park alongside the wall across from the main entrance. “It looks like the residents must have been completely isolated from the rest of the community, though.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Eik nodded. “I suppose they were locked up in this area,” he said, looking around as they stood in the courtyard.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The place had a depressing effect, as if the past still clung to the battered walls of the abandoned buildings.</p>
<p class="calibre6">There was no doorbell by the entrance to the day center so they let themselves in and immediately heard people talking.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise walked in a bit farther to look around. They had entered a long hall with framed photographs of the place as it looked in the past. On the opposite wall was a row of portraits with small brass signs underneath: the consulting doctors for the institution through the years.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Are you looking for someone?” a voice sounded suddenly from above.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise hadn’t noticed the stairs to the left of the front door.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-73"></a>“Yes,” she answered and waited as an elderly lady with straight gray hair and a welcoming smile descended the stairs. Definitely not the unnecessarily difficult woman on the phone. <em class="calibre5">A good start</em>, Louise thought.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Eik stepped forward to shake her hand while he explained who they were, and that they had called, were told the archives and records were kept either on-site or in the museum, and that they could come in to discuss gaining access.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“We would really like to see your old yearbooks.” Louise took over, explaining that they had an unidentified woman who now turned out to have possibly stayed at Eliselund as a child.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I saw the notice in the paper,” she said. “Do you think she might have been a patient here?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“We were contacted by someone who used to work here at Eliselund.” Louise told her that the former care assistant thought she recognized the distinctive scar. “We would really like to get in touch with the deceased’s next of kin. We were hoping that you might help us find her civil registration number so we can locate her family.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">The woman seemed to give their request some thought before weighing in. “I believe the yearbooks were mostly used to document full occupancy to the Care Division. They don’t say anything about the family relationships of the patients. That’s only in the patient records.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“And they’re in the museum?” Louise asked.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The lady smiled and shook her head. “Only the patient records for the groups from the middle of the last century are displayed over there. The rest of them are archived in the basement.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise sighed. “I wonder if you’d be kind enough to take a moment and check whether the file we’re looking for can be procured?” she asked. “I have a first name and a year.”</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-74"></a>The woman waved them along. “I can’t see that it would be a problem if you want to just go down to the basement yourselves and look through the records from that year. As long as you don’t remove them.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“That would be very helpful.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“After all, it’s almost unbearable to think that the next of kin should find out about the death from the media,” the woman continued.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise was well aware that you could not hand over confidential information even to the police, but in this case she did not see how it could do much harm, and was pleased to have found someone open to reason. And pleasant to deal with, as well.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Follow me,” the woman said, walking to the stairs, which continued down to the basement. “It’s a bit chilly down there and if you don’t have enough light to read in the archives, just go ahead and bring the files up here.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise had no intention of bringing anything back upstairs for fear of running into the shrew, who might throw a wrench in the works before they had a chance to obtain the information they needed.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I’m sure it’ll be fine and we’ll be out of your hair soon,” she said quickly. To her satisfaction she saw that Eik had already pulled a notepad from the inside pocket of his leather jacket.</p>
<p class="calibre6">A row of wooden doors with heavy iron fittings ran the length of the wide basement hallway on both sides, and the ceiling was high enough for them to walk upright without difficulty—even Eik, who had to be around six feet. The air smelled damp and musty, and it didn’t look as if the basement was used for anything but storage. Passing by the open rooms, they saw several beds with buckles and straps as well as an old dentist’s chair, which had been fitted to immobilize the patient’s arms and legs.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-75"></a>“I know—it gives you the chills just thinking about the torment that’s been suffered in that chair,” the woman said, having turned around. “I’ve been told that the dentist who looked after the residents’ teeth here didn’t use any anesthetic. Instead he just tied down his patients before he got started.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise shook her head.</p>
<p class="calibre6">They took a right at the end of the hallway and continued down yet another long corridor.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“The archives are down there at the end. It’s actually several rooms that have been combined into one,” the woman informed them. She explained that this part of the basement had at one point been used as a separate sick ward “for those patients who couldn’t be controlled without tying and who needed to be in isolation for a short time to avoid contagion.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise shuddered and thought for a moment that she could still sense a little of the spirit from that time. But most likely it was only because the moisture made the air stagnant, she thought.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Here.” The woman opened a door and showed them into a large room with shelves from floor to ceiling. “You’ll find the years marked under the volumes.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">She had turned on the ceiling light and was pointing to some white labels affixed to the front side of the shelves.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“The old institution had a bed capacity of three hundred, but additional beds were often set up so there’d be upward of four hundred patients at a time,” she told them. “As you can see, a lot of destinies have passed through here over the years.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise looked around. All along one wall, patient records were crammed together so tightly that she could barely make out the dusty green backs of the individual files. They all ranged from 1930 to 1960. On the next shelves, the records had been placed in beige files and spanned the next decade until <a id="page-76"></a>1970. Louise walked over to a slightly smaller bookcase behind the door and found that it was for the residents who were born in the last ten years of the institution, from 1970 to 1980. Some of them must have still been quite young when Eliselund closed down, she thought.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Here it is,” Eik said, pointing to an index tab projecting between the beige files. “Nineteen sixty-two.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise walked over and stood next to him to see. He had started pulling out files one by one in order to read the white label on each front page.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Wouldn’t it be easier if you take them out?” she suggested. “Let me take some of them and then we can quickly look through them all.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">He pulled a stack of files from the shelf; there were about twenty from that year. Louise took half of them and brought them over to where the light shone from a naked bulb hanging from the ceiling. She squatted down with the files on her lap. There were both men and women, all of them born in 1962. Erik, Lise, Mik, Søren, Hanne, Lone, Mette, Vibeke, Ole, Hans-Henrik…</p>
<p class="calibre6">She put the pile down on the floor so she wouldn’t get them mixed up. Eik brought the rest of the files over and squatted next to her.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Apparently the residents came from all across Zealand,” he noted as he quickly leafed through his pile, which had almost all boys.</p>
<p class="calibre6">There was no Lisemette in the records that Louise had, either.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Agnete Eskildsen wasn’t a hundred percent sure of the birth year,” she said. “Let’s get the year before and after.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I’ll take the early ones,” Eik suggested.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-77"></a>Louise wasn’t listening. She had picked up an old black-and-white photograph that had slipped out of one of the files when she got up. She walked over to the light and looked at the young girl’s face and naked torso. All of one side was peeling and nearly raw. In the few spots where the skin remained, it was heavily blistered. The girl lay with her eyes closed in a hospital bed, a white pillow under her head.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Eik had brought another volume from the shelf and was about to open the first file.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I think she’s here.” Louise replaced the stack of patient records on the floor in order to find the one to which the photo belonged. “I just need to find her.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">She put the file for Erik aside and opened Lise’s record. “Look!”</p>
<p class="calibre6">There were more photographs of the disfigured girl, including some in which the wound had started to heal. The damage to the tissue was so severe that it looked white and thick in several places. The skin stretching from the cheekbone and out toward her temple in particular was still rough and swollen with scabs. The shoulder was badly damaged as well.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Lise Andersen, born August six, 1962,” Louise read off, picking up the file. It didn’t say much about the scar except that the accident had happened in 1970. So the girl had been around eight years old, Louise concluded, quickly scanning the pages. In the back of the file, two forms from the home’s sick ward were attached.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise removed the paper clip and saw that Lise Andersen had had surgery to treat an umbilical hernia when she was five. The year after the accident, she had sustained a fracture to her left arm. Both were completely consistent with Flemming’s observations during the autopsy.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-78"></a>“It’s her.” She replaced the clip before handing the medical record to Eik. “Her civil registration number is at the top right corner. Write that down, would you?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Quickly she leafed through the final pages to find the girl’s basic information and learned that her parents had lived in Borup when the girl was admitted to the institution.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“She has a sister,” she read aloud and stood up to get closer to the light. “A twin sister named Mette.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Eik put the medical record back into the file on the floor and came over to read together with her. He positioned himself so closely behind Louise that she could feel the heat from his body in the cold basement.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I saw the sister’s name in the pile I went through.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“<em class="calibre5">Did</em> you find it?” she asked to make him back off a little.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Lisemette,” he said as he found the record in the pile. “Lise and Mette—there were two of them! Then I’ll write down her civil registration number as well—”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“She’s dead,” Louise cut in, astonished. “Lise Andersen died February twenty-seven, 1980.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Nineteen eighty?” Eik repeated uncomprehendingly and brought over the sister’s file. “What do you mean?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“There’s a death certificate in the back of the file, and according to that she died thirty-one years ago, six months shy of her eighteenth birthday.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise knelt down and spread out the few pictures from the file on the floor.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The girl had dark hair, and the prominent scar covered the exact same area as on the body she had seen at the Department of Forensic Medicine. She also thought she recognized the uninjured side of the face. The same delicate features.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“But that makes no sense,” she said, bewildered, and asked to see the sister’s file.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-79"></a>Eik leaned in to read along.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Mette Andersen,” she read. The two sisters were admitted to the institution together. Louise turned to the back of the file, letting the records slip out and fall to the floor as she pulled out one more death certificate.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“They died on the same day,” she noted with puzzlement and accepted Eik’s outreached hand as she went to stand back up. “February twenty-seven, 1980.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Eik looked as if he had completely checked out.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Not only did they die on the same day,” Louise continued, “they died at almost the same time, nine fifty-six a.m. and nine fifty-seven a.m.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“So the woman with the scar is long dead?” he asked, confused.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Looks like it,” Louise said. “But we know that she couldn’t have been because she’s still in cold storage at the Department of Forensic Medicine.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">She quickly leafed through the files, stripping them of whatever looked useful at first glance. She replaced the rest so the files were not left empty.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“We’d better leave something in there in case we need to get a warrant in order to gain official access to the information,” she said, sticking the papers and death certificates in her bag. “Let’s get out of here.” She helped Eik put the records back on the shelf.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“But how could she already be dead?” he tried again.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise shook her head. She didn’t have an answer.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Any luck?” a voice sounded behind them.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise could tell that Eik was in a rush to leave so she stopped and turned around to avoid giving the impression that they were running away.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“It was a big help,” she said, thanking the woman and smiling. “Now we’ve got a few things to go on.”</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-80"></a>“So was it her?” the gray-haired lady asked, her hand on the light switch to keep the light from going out.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“We think so,” Louise said. “And now we’re going to contact her family.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">She started walking down the hall to signal that they needed to get going.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Well, good luck,” the woman called out behind them. “I’ll keep the light on until you’ve made it upstairs.”</p>
<p class="space-break">R<span class="small-caps">IGHT UNTIL THE</span> end, Louise had feared running into the cranky hag she had spoken to over the phone, so once they were safely in the car she felt like it had been a bit too easy. As they drove over the hill, thoughts were buzzing in her head; she couldn’t decide in what order to proceed.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I’ll call Hanne and have her check the twins in the Civil Registration System,” Eik said, breaking the silence. He already had his phone to his ear and the notepad on his lap. “If she was declared dead at age seventeen like it says, it would be in the official register as well.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise nodded, concentrating on the narrow country road while feeling completely convinced that the woman she had seen on the autopsy table was Lise Andersen. It was perfectly plausible that the dead woman was forty-nine years old, she thought, and asked Eik to locate Lise’s parents. Surely they would know if they had buried their two daughters.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Did we bring the photos of our Jane Doe?” she asked as they were parked at a rest stop outside Ringsted waiting for Hanne to call them back and tell them whether the twins’ parents were still alive and, if so, where they lived.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Eik laboriously pulled two folded-up sheets of paper from his back pocket. “I printed them out before we left. Maybe <a id="page-81"></a>you should call the guys at the Center of Forensic Services and the Department of Forensic Medicine and give them her civil registration number,” he suggested. “They should be able to find medical or dental records once they have something to go by. That is, if they still exist.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">He pulled out his pack of cigarettes and was about to roll down the window.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“All the way out,” Louise demanded, and told him that she would make the call. “But I’m not sure if that stuff is saved that long after someone is dead. In 1980 there were no computer archives, of course, so it seems like they should have been in the records we found if they still exist.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Were they?” he asked through the open car door.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise shrugged. “I actually didn’t notice, and I don’t think we should go back until we know if it’s necessary.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">The opening notes of Pink Floyd’s <em class="calibre5">The Wall</em> sounded when Hanne called back.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise watched Eik with curiosity as he wrote something down, asking Rønholt’s secretary to repeat the last part.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Thanks, gorgeous,” he flattered before tossing the cell phone onto the front seat. “They’re both reported as dead in the national register.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“What about their parents—are they still alive?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Eik looked at the notes he had taken while talking. “The father is. Viggo Andersen lives in Dåstrup, which according to your good friend Hanne is just outside Viby Sjælland.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“We’ll go talk to him,” Louise decided, already setting up the GPS.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Hell no,” he objected. “We’re not going to see a father who lost both of his daughters more than thirty years ago and ask him to confirm that they’re dead.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">His hand darted to the leather string he wore around his <a id="page-82"></a>neck and he started tugging at the yellowed shark’s tooth that hung from it.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Of course we are,” she decided. “And that father did not lose his daughters thirty years ago. One of them is in the basement of the Department of Forensic Medicine right now. We need to speak with him.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“We don’t know for certain whether our Jane Doe is identical with one of those twins,” he insisted. “We only have our information from one person, who knew her a long time ago, and from guesswork based on a patient record. To me, that’s not enough to make an identification.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Louise turned toward him irritably.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“But it is to me,” she insisted, feeling convinced that she was right. “She has the same scar on her face, the same fracture on her left arm, and she’s had surgery to treat an umbilical hernia. That can’t all be a coincidence. Of course it’s the same person, and the father needs to identify her. And besides, he might know where she’s been hiding for the past thirty years.”</p>
