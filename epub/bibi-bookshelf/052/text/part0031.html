<p class="noindent1"><span class="dropcap">C</span><span class="small-caps">AMILLA SLOWED DOWN</span> a little, her eyes darting to the rearview mirror as she drove off down the winding dirt road. Her hands were shaking with adrenaline and her pulse rushed so rapidly that she was breathing through her mouth in sharp blows. She focused on the road and tried to take deep, calming breaths, while telling herself that it wasn’t so bad.</p>
<p class="calibre6">They had seen through her lie but what did she expect?</p>
<p class="calibre6">She realized that her fingers were hurting from gripping the steering wheel so tightly and loosened her grasp. Just then her phone started ringing in her purse, but when she spotted Lillian ahead, pulling her bicycle up a hill while talking on her cell phone, she ignored it until it stopped.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Camilla watched as Lillian turned around, spotted the car, and stepped farther into the gravel road. Sweat was dripping down her back and she had no idea why she had gotten herself into this mess. She hadn’t been looking for a story for the paper. <a id="page-204"></a>That wouldn’t have been enough to make her lie like this, she thought, stopping as Lillian positioned herself in the middle of the road with her bike, blocking the way. It was solely to satisfy her own curiosity that she had gone to Eliselund—and to try to forget the mess she had made of things at home, of course.</p>
<p class="calibre6">It was more like her foot found the gas pedal than her brain actually initiated the action. Camilla proceeded slowly at first but then she sped up and put her hand on the horn, holding it there as the car continued to accelerate. Pebbles sprayed the roadside and Lillian bounded off the road when she realized that Camilla did not intend to stop. The woman waved her arms to get her attention, but Camilla kept her eyes on the potholes in the road and shot past her without looking in her direction. She could only glimpse her brightly colored windbreaker from the corner of her eye when her cell phone started ringing once again, and shortly after she heard the beep signaling a new voice mail.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The dirt road ended just a little farther ahead. Camilla glanced in her rearview mirror one more time before signaling and turning onto the highway. Lillian was nowhere to be seen. She hadn’t made it over the final hilltop yet. Her heart pounding and bangs sticking to her temples, Camilla yielded to a succession of cars, her eyes continuing to dart to the mirror in case Lillian’s bike helmet started coming into view.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Her cell phone started ringing again from her purse on the floor. It hadn’t taken long for Lone Friis to track her down, Camilla thought, merging onto the road when a hole opened up in the line of cars snailing along now that the workday was over for most people. She had probably called up her old girlfriend to see what Agnete Eskildsen knew about Camilla or whether their connection was pure fabrication as well.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Camilla took a deep breath, cursing herself once again <a id="page-205"></a>for not just laying her cards on the table. This time it was a text message beeping in, and she started to wonder. The gray-haired woman was surprisingly persistent. A car honked at her when she pulled over without warning across the narrow strip of grass separating the road from the bike path. She turned off the engine and reached down for her phone.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Four missed calls and two text messages—all of them from Frederik.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The first message read: <em class="calibre5">Come to the Hotel Prindsen ASAP</em>; the second message merely said: <em class="calibre5">Let the front desk know when you arrive.</em></p>
<p class="calibre6">Camilla stared at her phone, re-reading both messages. Then she closed her eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She would have preferred to have all of Eliselund hot on her heels than to receive just one of Frederik’s messages.</p>
<p class="calibre6">At a hotel, she thought, feeling the adrenaline drain suddenly from her body and leave her listless. Not even at home.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Let the front desk know when you arrive!”</p>
<p class="calibre6">She snorted and signaled back into the road. It was as if he were summoning her to a business meeting. But then it occurred to her that this might be exactly the case. Everything had been quiet since she left their home and now he wanted to convene in a neutral location in town.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Her heart felt heavy and she cursed her temper even more. She blinked a few times as tears started welling up, blurring her vision. Her phone rang again and she answered without checking the display.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Yes,” she answered, clearing her throat as her voice cracked.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Hello, this is Lone Friis. You were just down here at Eliselund.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Yes,” Camilla repeated. “That’s correct, and it’s also true that Parkov isn’t my mom. I made up that story to find out who <a id="page-206"></a>was the director of the place when it closed down.” The words came tumbling out. “I want to find her to ask how someone could have signed a death certificate for a person who isn’t dead. And why…”</p>
<p class="calibre6">She fell silent, her voice faltering as she looked in the direction of the riding academy located just before the town of Osted. One of her girlfriends once had a horse down there.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I just wanted to say that you forgot your sweater.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Camilla was barely listening. Now she had admitted to her story, and lying hadn’t done her one damn bit of good. Lone Friis had every right to be angry.</p>
<p class="calibre6">It was the older woman’s turn to clear her throat. “It wasn’t your mother… or Bodil Parkov,” she corrected herself. “I just went and checked. She quit and left at the end of February the same year that Eliselund closed down, but at that time the deputy director had taken over the management.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Camilla was now fully attentive once again and looked around for a place to pull over. She knew there would be a bus stop a little way ahead. This time she signaled well in advance.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I got out the old registers. We don’t use those anymore, of course, but they’re still stored in the old superintendent’s office. I got curious after you ran off like that. I heard what you said to Lillian and of course I can put two and two together since the police came down here as well, asking about the same girls.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“What did it say?” Camilla interrupted her, staring at the dashboard of the car without really seeing it.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“It says that the sisters died from pneumonia. They were admitted for three days before they passed away, and were under the care of the same doctor who later signed the death certificates.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“What was his name?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Hmmm…” It sounded like Lone Friis was reading. “Dr. Ernst Holsted.”</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-207"></a>“How is it possible that nobody reacted to their deaths coming so close together?” Camilla asked.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“It would appear that the doctor didn’t quite live up to his responsibilities. From what it says here, it looks like he didn’t attend to his two patients as often as he should have considering the fatal development of the situation for the girls.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“But the girls didn’t die,” Camilla insisted—<em class="calibre5">or at least one of them didn’t</em>, she thought. “So how did the death certificates get issued?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“That does sound very strange,” Lone Friis conceded.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I suppose it’s possible that nobody at Eliselund proceeded any further because someone was trying to protect themselves against accusations of medical malpractice and subsequent lawsuits. Maybe the former consultant doctor can offer you an explanation.”</p>
<p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre5">I’ll definitely see what he has to say</em>, Camilla decided. She inquired curiously to how Lone Friis had been able to track down her number.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“You had some business cards in the pocket of your sweater so it wasn’t really that difficult.” Then she asked Camilla to refrain from mentioning that the source of her information was the old register.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Of course,” Camilla promised and thanked Lone Friis for her offer to mail the sweater back to her.</p>
<p class="space-break">S<span class="small-caps">HE WAS JUST</span> about to put her cell phone down when Markus called.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Hi, honey!” she said.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Mom, can you come get me from August’s house? I’m too tired to walk home and Frederik isn’t answering his phone.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Aren’t you with Dad?”</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-208"></a>“No, I didn’t want to go there after school so I went home with August.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Markus hadn’t bothered to say hi or ask how she’d been these past few days. He just expected her to be at his disposal when he needed her, and that infuriated Camilla.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“No way. You’re old enough to walk the two miles to get home,” she answered briefly and turned off her phone.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Markus had always had the chores she deemed necessary for him to build a sense of responsibility, but since they had been living at the manor house, he tended to just forget things. And maybe she did, too, she thought as she drove through Osted. Maybe that’s why she lost her touch… and her focus.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Something inside her had gone missing lately, something that used to be important to her. She felt terribly lost and disconnected. As the small-town scenery rolled by outside, she realized that she needed to find herself again. To reignite her passion; to relocate her personal touch. If not, she feared she’d wither away.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Come to think of it, that was probably why she’d gotten so out of hand at Eliselund. Apparently she needed a story to devote herself to if she was to stand being around herself.</p>
<p class="calibre6">It was another six miles to Roskilde when she called her old executive editor, Terkel Høyer, at the morning paper to find out why he had contacted her. He picked up on the second ring and apparently he still had her number in his phone.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Hey, Lind!”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“You called me?”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Well, yeah—but that was just to remind you that you still need to turn in your key card to the front gate.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I need to get back to work,” Camilla said. “Please let me know if you’ve got something for me. I miss writing. Freelance would be fine, too.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I don’t suppose you need the money,” he teased in a snide <a id="page-209"></a>tone that she hadn’t heard from him before. Maybe she had made a mistake in calling. And she certainly wasn’t going to say that she may end up needing the money now more than ever if she was going to have to support herself and Markus on an unstable freelancer’s pay.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Just give me a call if you need something,” she said, already on the retreat. “And I’ll be in touch if I think of any ideas that might be interesting to you.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“All right, that’s settled then,” Høyer said, sounding pleased. He hadn’t promised anything. Camilla recognized his rejection. She had heard him say the same thing to scores of freelance journalists trying to sell their stories. “That’s settled then,” he would always say, and then that was the last of it.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She turned off her phone, regretting having made the call. Just then she saw the blue lights flashing in her side-view mirror. She hadn’t noticed the police car following her while she talked on her cell phone. Now it pulled forward a little and signaled for her to pull over.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Fuck!” she exclaimed and signaled off, throwing her cell phone down on the passenger seat.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“That’s going to be an expensive call,” the officer opened after she rolled down her window.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Yes.” Camilla went to get her driver’s license out.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Because you know it’s illegal to talk on the phone like that while driving.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Yes,” Camilla snapped, handing him her license.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“I see you have a hands-free phone device installed,” he said, leaning forward to look inside the car. “If you had used it, you could have avoided the ticket I’m about to write.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Camilla turned in her seat and looked at him. “My day can’t get much worse so you just go ahead and write up that ticket. Or two of them—I really don’t care,” she hissed.</p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="page-210"></a>“But it might be nice if you learned a little from the ticket,” he mumbled. “It’s because it’s dangerous to talk on the phone while driving, you know.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">Camilla just managed to bite her tongue before her temper got the best of her. Mustering all her strength she attempted to smile at him, hoping it didn’t look quite as forced as it felt.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Of course,” she said. “Of course one should take it seriously and learn something.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">For one, she was definitely going to have to learn to control her temper, she thought, and angelically accepted the ticket that the officer handed her.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“Have a nice day,” she said as he was about to return to his car.</p>
<p class="calibre6">“You too.” He shot her an awkward smile. “Sounds like it can only get better.”</p>
<p class="calibre6">She stayed parked until after they left.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Unfortunately, the officer was wrong. Her day could get much worse. She still had to go to the hotel and see Frederik.</p>
