         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p923"><span class="dropcap-rw">T</span>he voice thundered down at her. “You killed your own mother! You robbed her of life and made yourself the master over life and death.”</p>
         <p id="p924">His anger with Sofie was like a hot cloud surrounding him. His eyes blazed with contempt.</p>
         <p id="p925">“I didn’t kill her. I respected her wishes.” She pulled her legs up to her chest.</p>
         <p id="p926">Sofie had just gotten out of bed and was holding a hot mug of tea where she sat on the corner of the sofa. An empty feeling lay heavily inside her after having cried most of the night. It had been the right decision, but the finality of it and the loss had made her deeply unhappy.</p>
         <p id="p927">“I’m not asking you to understand,” she said. “Well, actually, yes, I am. Please, won’t you hold me?” Her voice was small. She felt like she was on the edge of a deep chasm; her sorrow had robbed her of the energy and will to defend herself. She just wanted to explain her actions, and for him to understand. Or at least see things from her side.</p>
         <p id="p928">“I’ll report her to the police,” he continued. “I’ll report that damned doctor who thinks she can play God.”</p>
         <p id="p929">“No you won’t!” Sofie said. “You’ll keep her out of this. If you’re going to report anybody, report me. I respect people’s rights to choose—”</p>
         <p id="p930">“<i>You</i> have no right. <i>We</i> have no right to play God in our own or anyone else’s life. How could you do this to me? To<i> us</i>.”</p>
         <p id="p931">“This isn’t about you.” Now Sofie was angry. How could she have been so naïve as to think he would understand? “You of all people should be able to show compassion. I believe in death with dignity, and I won’t stand for you judging me.”</p>
         <p id="p932">For a second she thought he was going to kill her. He rushed over to the sofa, his dark eyes lit with rage, his voice icy. “You will never talk about this to anyone, ever. I will not accept your voicing an opinion so strongly against everything I stand for and what I preach in church. Jesus died on the cross for us. Was that a dignified or undignified death?”</p>
         <p id="p933">He jammed one knee on the sofa, his face so close that droplets of spittle spattered her cheeks.</p>
         <p id="p934">Though she was close to tears, Sofie stared back at him in defiance.</p>
         <p id="p935">“I can’t have a wife who so openly defies God’s will,” he continued. “What could you possibly have been thinking?”</p>
         <p id="p936">“I’m no longer your wife.” Her voice was flat, and even now, as she was cornered in the sofa and not reacting as she should, filled with defiance and anger and despair and sorrow. She wanted to talk to him about Christian charity and understanding. But she couldn’t. She didn’t have it in her. She felt as if she were falling. Over the edge of the abyss.</p>
         <p id="p937">He kept raging at her, but she didn’t listen. She thought about her mother and the evening in her apartment when she had emptied her bottle of pills. Alone.</p>
         <p id="p938">She thought about the suicide note. It was her handwriting, no doubt about that, yet it was different. A bit shaky, not as firm as usual.</p>
         <div class="block-rw" id="extract1">
            <p class="ext1-rw" id="p939"><i>To my beloved daughter.</i></p>
            <p class="ext-rw" id="p940"><i>I can’t go on any longer, I’m asking you to understand and accept and forgive my (selfish) way of saying good-bye to you.</i></p>
            <p class="ext-rw" id="p941"><i>Good night.</i></p>
         </div>
         <p class="indent-rw" id="p942">When the police had arrived to check the apartment, after her mother had been taken to the hospital, one of the officers wanted to take the note with him, but Sofie had objected. They took a photocopy of the letter and left the original with her.</p>
         <p id="p943">“You’re my wife for better or worse,” he said, biting off his words, “and we agreed to love and honor each other till death do us part.” He stood by the window with his back turned defiantly to her.</p>
         <p id="p944">She was about to say something about the capacity for understanding, but instead she quoted another part of the marriage ritual. “Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you have a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you.”</p>
         <p id="p945">He whirled around and pointed an accusing finger at her. “Don’t you speak the words of God after what you’ve just done!”</p>
         <p id="p946">Sofie tried to fight off her sobbing, but it rose out of her like a gusher. Grief from her mother’s death, his anger, her sense of being completely alone, but most of all the injustice of being attacked for keeping a promise.</p>
         <p id="p947">She stood up. “You can’t refuse to officiate her funeral service. She lived in this town all her life, she was christened and confirmed in the church. My parents were married in our church. What kind of a person are you?”</p>
         <p id="p948">“It’s no longer your church.”</p>
         <p id="p949">The look he gave her was so cold that she felt her love for him collapse inside her. “You can’t do this to her,” she whispered. Her hands felt icy.</p>
         <p id="p950">“You can’t do this to me.” His voice sounded completely flat, his words might as well have been spoken by a stranger. “Until you regain your senses, you will not set foot in my manse. You will leave, and you will not even<i> try</i> to put me in a situation where my congregation can doubt all that I stand for.”</p>
         <p id="p951">He left the room, and a while later, after Sofie pulled herself together and walked into the kitchen, he was gone.</p>
