         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1795"><span class="dropcap-rw">E</span>ik showed up in the doorway unshaven and out of breath, and immediately asked, “Where’s Stephanie?” He looked around.</p>
         <p id="p1796">“Welcome home,” Louise said, a bit sharply perhaps, but her stomach sank when she stood up. He looked battered and exhausted in his leather jacket and black jeans, his hair hanging down over his eyebrows. But he smiled and walked over to her, put his hands on her shoulders, and kissed her on the forehead.</p>
         <p id="p1797">“What a hell of an ordeal this has been.”</p>
         <p id="p1798">He looked at her intently, as if he were forcing his way inside her to check how much damage the past several days had done to them.</p>
         <p id="p1799">“She’s sitting in here waiting for you,” Louise said, the warmth of his hands still on her shoulders.</p>
         <p id="p1800">He followed her down the hallway. “How is she? What’s she like?”</p>
         <p id="p1801">Louise turned to him before they reached the door. “Relax.” In all the time she’d known him, this was the first time he’d seemed nervous. “She’s just identified the man who’s probably our perpetrator. It was a coincidence.”</p>
         <p id="p1802">She told him about the photo they had been about to send out to every police district. “We thought he was one of the people we had to protect. But Steph says he shot her mother. She reacted very strongly to the photo, so right now we’re trying to find him and bring him in, and we’ll see what he says about being identified by a witness.”</p>
         <p id="p1803">She paused for a moment. “There’s a distinct possibility he has an alibi. But at least we can eliminate him.”</p>
         <p id="p1804">“If she says so, it’s him!”</p>
         <p id="p1805">Louise nodded. “At the very least we have a general description to go on.”</p>
         <p id="p1806">“She wouldn’t just say something like that!”</p>
         <p id="p1807">“You haven’t even met her,” Louise pointed out. She smiled when they stopped outside Michael Stig’s office. “I’ll leave you two alone.”</p>
         <p id="p1808">Toft approached her with a search warrant in his hand. “We’re on our way to Birkerød to search his house.”</p>
         <p id="p1809">“Let’s talk this evening,” Louise said hurriedly to Eik. “She’s a sweet girl, everything is going to be fine. Come over to my…to our place.” She turned to meet Toft.</p>
         <p id="p1810">“Hey! Where is she?”</p>
         <p id="p1811">Louise turned back to Eik, who was standing in the office doorway. “Maybe she’s in the lounge,” she said. “I told her she could grab something to eat or drink.”</p>
         <p id="p1812">Eik had already ducked into the office, but a few moments later he was out in the hall again. “Come here, there’s something you need to see.”</p>
         <p id="p1813">He pointed at the copy of the photo of Sørensen and his wife. It lay on the desk, along with the message that had been sent to the police districts. “What the hell is this?”</p>
         <p id="p1814">The photo had been torn apart in the middle, and only Erik Hald Sørensen remained. Horns had been drawn on his head with a black felt pen, and a target now covered his face. He’d been shot between the eyes with an arrow.</p>
         <p id="p1815">“It’s the man she identified as killing her mother.”</p>
         <p id="p1816">Eik stiffened and reached for the photo, but changed his mind and let it lie. “I should’ve insisted on meeting her the second Sofie told me we had a daughter.” He sat down on the desk. “I should’ve made her let me see the girl, but I wasn’t ready, at all. At first I thought someone was fucking with me when I saw the email. All those years without a word from her, and suddenly there she was, in my in-box.”</p>
         <p id="p1817">Louise had pulled out a chair and was leaning up against its back.</p>
         <p id="p1818">“I don’t know if you can imagine how crazy it is, being told you have a daughter who’s almost grown up.”</p>
         <p id="p1819">Louise thought about Jonas, who was a preteen when he had entered her life. She also hadn’t known she was suddenly about to have a child, and the emotions rising up just from the thought of him overwhelmed her. Thinking about Eik’s reaction at hearing he had a daughter, his own flesh and blood, killed off the last traces of her anger toward him.</p>
         <p id="p1820">“I wrote Sofie that I wanted to come over right then to meet her, but that was too fast for her. She wanted it done the right way, she said, and I flew off the handle. She was hardly the one to talk about doing things the right way. Sixteen years she’d kept Stephanie a secret from me. I had the right to meet her.”</p>
         <p id="p1821">Louise’s thoughts wandered as Eik talked. What would happen when a sensitive teenager found out she had a different father than she’d thought? One who lived an hour’s flight away. And shortly thereafter, she’d seen her mother being killed. Louise’s fingertips tingled, her nerves twitched in alarm.</p>
         <p id="p1822">Eik was still talking, but she wasn’t listening. His sixteen-year-old daughter could be a stray missile out there somewhere, seeking its target.</p>
         <p id="p1823">Even though he was opening up to her about his anger at his ex-girlfriend, the woman who had kept him out of his daughter’s life, Louise interrupted him. “You check the bathrooms, I’ll look for her in the lounge.”</p>
         <p id="p1824">She was already out the door. She stuck her head into the kitchenette; the dishwasher was beeping, ready to be emptied. She looked everywhere she could think of, then she ran back to her temporary office, grabbed the phone, and called down to the officer guarding the front door to hear if her guest had left Police Headquarters.</p>
         <p id="p1825">“If she has, she didn’t return her guest pass,” the officer said.</p>
         <p id="p1826">“Damn it, you’re sitting down there to keep an eye on people!” Louise snapped. She couldn’t help it; she was getting more worried by the moment.</p>
         <p id="p1827">Back in Stig’s office, she found Eik behind her colleague’s computer. “Did you check the bathrooms?” she said, annoyed at him for not helping.</p>
         <p id="p1828">“She wasn’t there,” he answered, without looking up. “And if Stephanie’s right, that this man shot her mother, we have to find her before she finds him.”</p>
         <p id="p1829">“How could she know where to look?” Louise mumbled, mostly to herself. She pressed her fingertips against her temples, as if the small circles she made could help her concentrate. “She doesn’t know where he lives.”</p>
         <p id="p1830">She tried to remember, had she mentioned the address when she sent a patrol car to Birkerød? Damn it, maybe she had…</p>
         <p id="p1831">She hurried back to her office and ran into Jørgensen in the doorway just as he was sticking his phone in his pocket. He had his coat on. “Are the patrol cars out there yet?” she asked.</p>
         <p id="p1832">“They just arrived. Nobody’s there.”</p>
         <p id="p1833">“Steph is gone, and we don’t know if she’d try to find him.”</p>
         <p id="p1834">Her old partner looked at her in surprise.</p>
         <p id="p1835">“Never mind, I’ll explain later. Before you leave, call the officers out there and tell them to keep an eye out for her. And if she shows up, we need to know immediately. Tell them it’s a young girl, possibly unstable.”</p>
         <div class="decoration-rw" id="decoration27">

         </div>
         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1837">“We have two patrol cars at Sørensen’s home in Birkerød,” she said, when she returned to Stig’s office. “They’ve been told to keep an eye out for Steph, they’ll let us know if she shows up.”</p>
         <p id="p1838">Eik lifted his hand to stop her. “Try to think like her. We have files, we can check on people, but Stephanie doesn’t have shit. She gets shoved in here to wait. What does she do?”</p>
         <p id="p1839">“Eik, we don’t have time—”</p>
         <p id="p1840">“You saw what she did to the photo—come on! She’s upset and angry.”</p>
         <p id="p1841">“Let’s try to stay calm,” Louise said, aware that she was talking to herself as much as to Eik.</p>
         <p id="p1842">He ignored her. “She probably has a cell phone, and definitely had access to this computer some idiot forgot to log out of. So of course she googles the name on the APB.”</p>
         <p id="p1843">Something in his tense voice made Louise walk around the office chair and peek over his shoulder.</p>
         <p id="p1844">“His name has been typed in, and see, his photos pop up when you search.”</p>
         <p id="p1845">Photos of Erik Hald Sørensen appeared on the screen, seven of them in the top row of results. Two of the faces she didn’t recognize. The five others were of the retired doctor, photos that had at some time been on the Internet. He also showed up on the second row of results, a few times with his wife, mostly from their choir travels. Possibly from local papers, Louise thought.</p>
         <p id="p1846">Eik scrolled down the purple links his daughter had opened. He frowned as his fingers worked. “Look at this.” He scooted a bit to the side. “When I search his name with ‘address,’ it’s not the Birkerød address that shows up. Here he’s listed with an address on Skovridergårdsvej in Virum.” He looked up at her.</p>
         <p id="p1847">“It could be his clinic,” she said. “He might still have that address, even though he gave up his practice.” Then she remembered him mentioning that the clinic was in Hareskovby.</p>
         <p id="p1848">Eik broke into her thoughts. “A Vivian Hald Sørensen is also registered at the Virum address.”</p>
         <p id="p1849">Time stood still as Louise struggled to take in all he’d said. After a moment she came back to life and ran to her office. She’d just grabbed her coat when Eik showed up in the doorway. “It’s his ex-wife’s place,” she said. “He’s hiding out there.”</p>
         <p id="p1850">“It’s for sure where Stephanie’s gone to look for him,” Eik said, as they ran down the hall.</p>
