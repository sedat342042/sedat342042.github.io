         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1452"><span class="dropcap-rw">C</span>amilla wasn’t about to wait for Terkel Høyer to return from his meeting or answer her text. She hopped in her car and headed for Jutland.</p>
         <p id="p1453">After arriving at work, she’d barely had time to pour a cup of coffee and sit down in the editorial office to get ready to work on the Switzerland story before Stig Tåsing called and asked if she could come by the manse.</p>
         <p id="p1454">“It’s not something we can talk about on the phone?” she said, thinking about her deadline. If the article about the suicide clinic was going to be in tomorrow’s paper, she had to get busy.</p>
         <p id="p1455">“No,” he’d said. “You have to come over here.”</p>
         <p id="p1456">She was on the Great Belt Bridge when her editor in chief called and asked where the hell she’d gone off to now.</p>
         <p id="p1457">“I had to leave,” she said. She explained what had happened. “He wouldn’t tell me what it was about, but I’m guessing he’s ready to say more.”</p>
         <p id="p1458">“And how did you<i> guess</i> your way to that conclusion?” Høyer didn’t sound all that confident in her judgment.</p>
         <p id="p1459">“I’ll pay the toll and gas,” she said, while passing a semi.</p>
         <p id="p1460">“Right now I’m more interested in hearing how you’re going to get that article written. I’m holding a two-page spread for tomorrow.”</p>
         <p id="p1461">“You’ll get your story. But if we can get something more out of the pastor, it’ll damn well be worth it. The Switzerland story won’t be any worse the day after tomorrow. What the hell’s wrong with you, Terkel, what’s happened to your nose for a story?”</p>
         <p id="p1462">“All right,” he mumbled. “I guess I just have to get used to you being back.”</p>
         <div class="decoration-rw" id="decoration22">
            <p class="center-rw" id="p1463">*  *  *</p>
         </div>
         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1464">From a distance she spotted the church and the beautiful, whitewashed manse with its red tile roof. The bare crowns in the tall trees surrounding it looked like thin, bony arms reaching for the sky. She signaled to turn off and slowed down.</p>
         <p id="p1465">Several texts had beeped in on the way, so she pulled over and checked her phone. Frederik asked if she had time to Skype. Camilla was about to answer that it would be a while, when she realized he was probably in bed. It must be night in Los Angeles.</p>
         <p id="p1466">Suddenly her stomach knotted, and instead of texting she called him, mostly just to hear his voice.</p>
         <p id="p1467">While waiting for an answer, she looked out over the brown fields. Snow clung to the hedgerows. She missed her husband, so much that her chest ached. Maybe it was all this talk about death, her imagining how it would be to travel to Switzerland and send the person she loved most on his final journey. She couldn’t shake her experience at the suicide clinic; she longed to snuggle up to Frederik and hear his thoughts about all this.</p>
         <p id="p1468">His answering service kicked in. She left a message, explaining that she was in Jutland and that she loved him and missed him very, very much. She would do everything she could to talk Markus into flying to L.A. during winter vacation, if it was humanly possible to separate him from his girlfriend. She parked in front of the manse. Otherwise she’d have to invite Julia to go with them. No matter what, she was going to spend a week over there with Frederik.</p>
         <p id="p1469">Stig Tåsing stepped outside. He wore jeans and a T-shirt, his chestnut-brown hair combed back. He still had his slippers on, as if he hadn’t really started his day yet.</p>
         <p id="p1470">They greeted each other. His mood was serious, and he seemed eager to get her inside. On the way, Camilla had tried to guess what was so important that he would ask her to drive over. Now he took her arm and led her to the manse, as if they were coconspirators.</p>
         <p id="p1471">“Early this morning,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper, “the doorbell woke me up. It was Sofie’s daughter. She thought I was her father. She came here to Denmark to find him.”</p>
         <p id="p1472">Camilla gaped in surprise. “I’ll be damned,” she said, forgetting that he was a pastor.</p>
         <p id="p1473">“She has the same way of looking at people as her mother, only her eyes are darker.”</p>
         <p id="p1474">His unexpected guest had shaken him up; she could see that.</p>
         <p id="p1475">“Of course I told her I’m not her father, but she’s very upset. And very determined to find him. Somebody simply has to help this poor girl, and I thought about you.”</p>
         <p id="p1476">Camilla nodded. “Good thinking.” She followed him inside, her thoughts racing—how much should she tell the young girl? She didn’t know for certain that Eik was the girl’s father, and also, how could she tell her that he was in jail in England, being held for the murder of her mother?</p>
         <p id="p1477">Maybe she shouldn’t say anything, maybe she should just call Louise. While taking off her boots in the hallway, she decided it wouldn’t hurt to hear what the girl had to say. Then she could call.</p>
         <p id="p1478">He led her through the house. The girl was sitting on the sofa in the living room, wrapped up in a blanket. Camilla stopped in the doorway and looked the girl over. It was almost comical, how much she resembled Eik. Or was it just because she was looking for it? She walked over and introduced herself. The girl surprised her by speaking Danish, asking if Camilla had known her mother.</p>
         <p id="p1479">“No, I didn’t, but I think I can help you find your father.” She nodded when the pastor asked if she’d like a cup of tea.</p>
         <p id="p1480">“Mum taught me Danish,” Stephanie said, after he left the room. Camilla’s surprise had apparently been obvious. “She didn’t have any ties left to Denmark, but it was important to her that we could speak Danish together.”</p>
         <p id="p1481">“A wise mother,” Camilla said. She studied the girl’s pale face, her dark eye makeup. On the surface, Eik’s daughter looked like a tough girl. If she were scared or crushed by her mother’s death, she was certainly hiding it well.</p>
         <p id="p1482">“I’m here to find my real father,” she said, without bothering to explain why she had shown up out of the blue at a manse in Jutland. “I ran off because I can’t stand the complete idiot my mother married, and I know he’ll never help me find my biological father. I don’t understand why they didn’t tell me a long time ago.”</p>
         <p id="p1483">“Tell you what?”</p>
         <p id="p1484">“That I had another father!” She threw up her hands. “They could have just said, then I wouldn’t have had to stay there and listen to him yell at me all the time. She just told me for the first time a month ago.” She shook her head and bent over, her fists under her chin as she stared straight ahead.</p>
         <p id="p1485">The pastor returned with a tray carrying a teapot, biscuits, and buttered rolls. Camilla wondered if he kept these things on hand, in case someone suddenly showed up needing to talk. “How did you find me?” he asked.</p>
         <p id="p1486">“I searched my mother’s office for some clue of where to look in Denmark.” Stephanie straightened up again. “I found your marriage certificate and the address here.”</p>
         <p id="p1487">“She kept it?” The pastor’s eyes clouded over.</p>
         <p id="p1488">“That’s why I thought it was you.”</p>
         <p id="p1489">“How did you get here?” Camilla asked. “Did you fly to Copenhagen?”</p>
         <p id="p1490">The girl looked at Camilla as if the question were ridiculous. “I’m sixteen. I’m perfectly able to buy a plane ticket. I took a flight from Bristol, and my mother had a lot of money stashed in her office. I can take care of myself for now.”</p>
         <p id="p1491">“Of course, you can,” Camilla replied quickly. How could she win a stubborn teenage girl’s trust in record time?</p>
         <p id="p1492">“Will you help me?” the girl asked, before Camilla had time to think out a strategy.</p>
         <p id="p1493">“I absolutely will.”</p>
         <p id="p1494">“Stephanie explained that her mother had plans for them to visit Denmark, so she could meet her father,” the pastor said. “Which didn’t happen. So now she’s here to look for him.”</p>
         <p id="p1495">“Steph,” the girl said. “My name is Steph, and I’m going to find him.”</p>
         <p id="p1496">“How much do you know about your father?” Camilla asked.</p>
         <p id="p1497">“Nothing.” A hint of vulnerability showed through her mask, which made her look very young. “I don’t know his name or where to look. But I’ll keep trying until I find him, I’m not going back to live with Nigel.”</p>
         <p id="p1498">“Has he done anything to you?” The girl’s utter contempt for him concerned Camilla.</p>
         <p id="p1499">The girl flashed a smile, and suddenly all the black shadows couldn’t hide how pretty she was. “No, he’d never do that, he’s just so…irritating. He criticizes me constantly, nothing I do is good enough. Mum promised me she’d talk to my real father, see if maybe I could live with him for a while, at least until I could move away from home. I think he irritated her, too, because she started defending me.”</p>
         <p id="p1500">Had she considered whether her biological father was as anxious to meet her as she was to meet him? It didn’t seem so to Camilla. At least until Steph said, “And if he didn’t want anything to do with me, she promised she’d find a boarding school for me.”</p>
         <p id="p1501">The pastor poured tea for all three of them. “Please, eat.”</p>
         <p id="p1502">“You were married to my mother. Why didn’t you keep in contact with her?” Steph sounded like a child who suddenly discovers that she’s completely alone.</p>
         <p id="p1503">The pastor laid the tray down without answering. Instinctively, Camilla sat down beside the girl, put her arm around her shoulder, and pulled her close. Had anyone even comforted the girl after her mother’s death? She should have been offered help from a therapist, after having gone through such a brutal, traumatic experience. Camilla’s impression was that she’d had to deal with everything herself, now that her mother wasn’t there to take care of her.</p>
         <p id="p1504">The girl’s body felt tense under her arm. Her breath was ragged, but she didn’t push Camilla away. After a few moments, her body slumped into Camilla. “I don’t know what to do, now that she’s gone.” Her voice was small, but she wasn’t crying.</p>
         <p id="p1505">“You can stay with me in Copenhagen while we try to find your father.” Camilla thought about all the empty rooms in their enormous Frederiksberg apartment. “But I want you to talk to the police. You can help them by describing the man who shot your mother.”</p>
         <p id="p1506">The girl looked surprised, but she nodded. Her stubborn expression had returned. “It’s a deal. Will you promise I won’t be sent back to England?”</p>
         <p id="p1507">“I can’t promise you that. But I know someone who will fight for you, that I can guarantee. She works for the Copenhagen Police. Her name is Louise Rick, and you’ve already met her.”</p>
