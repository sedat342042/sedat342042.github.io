         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p2041"><i>The Lost Woman</i> is fiction, and any resemblance to actual people or events is coincidental. The characters and plot are products of my imagination, though they were inspired by actual events that awoke my curiosity and prodded me to investigate.</p>
         <p id="p2042">In this connection, I would like to express my special and heartfelt gratitude to Rikke Kimie Andersen and Kim Frank Hoffmann, who opened up to me about their experiences at Dignitas, a suicide clinic in Switzerland, where they recently said their good-byes to Jane Hoffman.</p>
         <p id="p2043">Special thanks go out to Brian and Conny Doktor, for always being willing to share their medical expertise and helping me with diseases and diagnoses that fit the plots of my books.</p>
         <p id="p2044">Thank you, Lisbeth Møller-Madsen, for being such a talented editor; it’s a great pleasure to work with you. Thanks also go out to Rasmus Funder. Your book covers always convey the mood I hope for but never can express in words. Thank you, everyone at People’s Press, my publisher. I’m very happy working and spending time together with you.</p>
         <p id="p2045">Malene Kirkegaard Nielsen of the Plot Workshop has been an invaluable help to me. Thanks so much for sparring with me on the crime plot.</p>
         <p id="p2046">Thank you, Lotte Thorsen, for reading the manuscript and your wise and astute comments.</p>
         <p id="p2047">Thanks so much, Trine Busch—you are fantastic! Without you I would be burdened by so much more. Thank you for your wholehearted support of me and Louise Rick.</p>
         <p id="p2048">Thanks go out to my agent, Victoria Sanders, and to Bernadette and Chris. You give me energy and the urge to do so much more.</p>
         <p id="p2049">My greatest thanks go out to my son, Adam. Thank you for your support, your help, and your confidence that everything will work out. I love you more than anything in the world.</p>
