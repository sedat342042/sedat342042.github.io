         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p250"><span class="dropcap-rw">B</span>efore rushing down the stairway to leave Dina and Charlie with Melvin, Louise made several calls to Eik’s cell phone. His voice mail kicked in every time, asking her to leave a message. She called Rønholt to check if he’d heard anything during the night, but he knew nothing more.</p>
         <p id="p251">“I’m going to run up to his parents in Hillerød before coming in to work,” she said, explaining that she had found their address online. “Have you ever met them?”</p>
         <p id="p252">“I’ve only met his sister, but I think Mie is in Africa right now. I’ll set everything in motion soon as I get to the station, and I’ll see if I can’t hurry things up with the tower records on his cell phone.”</p>
         <p id="p253">The red stone house stood at the end of a cul-de-sac on the outskirts of Hillerød. Eik had told her he’d left home at seventeen, and he hadn’t had much to do with his parents since then. But she didn’t know if the sporadic contact stemmed from some problem, or if he just didn’t fit in with suburban conformity.</p>
         <p id="p254">Louise called his parents from the car, apologizing for disturbing them so early in the morning. When she said she was with the Copenhagen Police, his father sounded a bit dismissive, but when he heard she was his son’s colleague, and that they shared an office, his attitude changed. Suddenly she was more than welcome to come; they would both be at home until eleven, when his wife had a doctor’s appointment.</p>
         <p id="p255">The house stood close to the road, and on her way to the door she noticed what looked like a large lawn on the other side. A classic fifties residential area house. Some lawns had swing sets, others boasted flower gardens in pristine condition. Retirees and families with children, Louise decided. Not very much stuck out. Odd that this seemingly conventional suburban community was where the free-spirited Eik had grown up and played as a child, she thought. She rang the doorbell.</p>
         <p id="p256">Eik’s father was tall and narrow-shouldered, with very dark hair. He had the same high cheekbones as his son, and his hair was combed back flat like Eik’s, though there wasn’t much left of it. The resemblance made Louise smile wider when she shook his hand and thanked him for allowing her to come.</p>
         <p id="p257">“Please, come in, come in,” he said, and he gestured for her to follow him into the living room. “No need to take your shoes off. We’ve just brewed our morning coffee. Would you like a cup?”</p>
         <p id="p258">A worried-sounding voice came from the kitchen. “Hopefully nothing has happened to him.” Eik’s mother appeared in the doorway. Her right arm was in a cast, but she stuck her left arm out and held Louise’s hand as she gazed at her.</p>
         <p id="p259">“Aren’t you the one he’s been living with?” She let go of Louise’s hand. “We don’t hear much from him, but he did mention you the last time we saw him. He also spoke about your son.”</p>
         <p id="p260">Louise nodded and said that Jonas and Eik got along very well.</p>
         <p id="p261">The living room looked very different from what she’d expected, judging by the outside of the house. Asian style, lots of pillows, patterns, gold, Buddha figures, and shades of red. There was also a sofa set and coffee table, with everything shrouded in the mild, pleasing scent of incense. Louise felt ashamed of having been so quick to judge this residential area. Given that Eik’s name was inspired by the lead singer of a popular sixties Danish band, Steppeulvene, she should have known his parents would have a somewhat alternative lifestyle.</p>
         <p id="p262">She was offered a mug of coffee and a seat in a comfortable armchair by the window. When had Eik told them he’d moved in with her? she wondered. Recently, or quite a while ago?</p>
         <p id="p263">His father got straight to the point. “I hope he hasn’t gotten himself into any serious trouble. We are well aware of his occasional lapses, when it’s hard for him to work.”</p>
         <p id="p264">“Oh, Bent! That was a long time ago; it was back when she disappeared.”</p>
         <p id="p265">“We don’t know where he is,” Louise said, before they got into their son’s ex-girlfriend.</p>
         <p id="p266">“Well, he does drop out of sight once in a while,” his father said. “And Henni is right, it’s something that started after the tragedy down there.”</p>
         <p id="p267">A school photo of Eik stood in the windowsill. His hair was longer back then, nearly shoulder length. He wore what looked like a military shirt, and his eyes were a bit sleepy, as if he were bored and had been forced into having his picture taken.</p>
         <p id="p268">“There are a few special circumstances about Eik’s disappearance, and we want to make sure that nothing has happened to him.” Louise chose her words carefully, to convey the seriousness of the situation without worrying them too much. “So first I’d like to know, have you spoken with him since noon yesterday?”</p>
         <p id="p269">They both shook their heads.</p>
         <p id="p270">“Are you aware of any plans he might have had?”</p>
         <p id="p271">“No,” his mother said. “He usually doesn’t let us in on things like that, though.”</p>
         <p id="p272">“But he came by not too long ago,” Bent said. “Two, three months ago, wasn’t it?” He glanced over at his wife, who was sitting cross-legged on the sofa.</p>
         <p id="p273">“That sounds about right. It was definitely before your birthday. He brought along that bottle of port.”</p>
         <p id="p274">Louise didn’t know he had visited his parents while they had been living together. She would have liked to come along. “So you have no idea where he might be? Is it possible his sister might know something?”</p>
         <p id="p275">His mother explained that Eik’s sister was traveling in Sierra Leone with a female friend who had worked for Save the Children. “Mie won’t be home for another month, but, of course, it’s possible they’ve spoken.” She promised to ask. “She calls us every two or three days when she’s traveling.”</p>
         <p id="p276">“You could also try calling her,” his father suggested.</p>
         <p id="p277">“Her cell phone doesn’t work out there,” she told her husband.</p>
         <p id="p278">“Don’t worry, just ask her when she calls; that’s fine,” Louise said.</p>
         <p id="p279">“How are you two doing, by the way?” Eik’s mother asked. “You live in Frederiksberg, I believe?”</p>
         <p id="p280">Louise nodded. She almost told them they were very welcome to stop by someday, but she stopped herself. That was Eik’s decision. She thanked them for their time, then she stood up and promised to contact them as soon as he showed up.</p>
