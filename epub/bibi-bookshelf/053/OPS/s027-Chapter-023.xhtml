         </div>
         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1277"><span class="dropcap-rw">A</span>t seven thirty the next morning, Louise drove down a January-dark residential street in Hvidovre. She had tried to call the organization several times from home, but all she’d gotten was an answering machine. Before going into Police Headquarters, she drove out to see Margit Østergaard, the woman who had given her the number.</p>
         <p id="p1278">She crept slowly down the street, trying to spot the house number. Finally she parked in front of a small, white, single-story house.</p>
         <p id="p1279">A light shone from inside, though the outside of the house was dark. She got out of her car, straddled the dirty snow piled up against the curb, and walked up to the house.</p>
         <p id="p1280">The sidewalk had been shoveled, and several bird balls hung from trees in the front yard. Louise rang the front doorbell and stared at a wreath with small red berries hanging from a thin nail.</p>
         <p id="p1281">She waited a few moments before ringing again and leaning over to look in the kitchen window. A television appeared to be on in a room behind the kitchen. Maybe the living room, she thought. She rang one more time, this time holding the button down. Maybe Margit Østergaard was in the shower. No one answered.</p>
         <p id="p1282">She called again and once more got the answering machine. She stepped down and walked around the house on a narrow tiled path hugging the wall. Through one of the three windows in back, she noticed the television was still on in the living room. Louise approached the window, then immediately jumped back a step.</p>
         <p id="p1283">A standing lamp glowed beside an armchair. A plate of food had been set on the coffee table. In the middle of the room the home hospice nurse lay facedown on the floor, the back of her head shot off.</p>
         <p id="p1284"><i>Shit shit shit!</i> Louise caught herself wishing that Eik or even Olle were there. She pushed the handle of the terrace door with her elbow. Locked. Now she noticed the bullet hole in the big window, like a spiderweb, the threads sparkling in the light, the midpoint dark, dead. It didn’t look like much, compared to the extensive damage the woman had suffered from the shot.</p>
         <p id="p1285">Louise’s heart pounded; quickly she glanced around before calling 112, the police emergency number. On autopilot now, she gave the address and name of the victim. Described what she saw and knew: single woman, middle-aged, no obvious signs of break-in, no sign of a struggle in the living room—presumably the perpetrator hadn’t been in the house. Then she described the bullet hole in the window and the trauma of the victim visible from where she stood.</p>
         <p id="p1286">After the call, she looked around, her senses alert as her breath hung in the light from the living room. The sky was turning brighter, though it looked like it might be one of those days without a real daytime. Clouds hung heavy in the sky, shrouding everything in a dark gray haze. Temperatures had risen in the night, a thaw had begun; it would be difficult to find clear tracks, unfortunately. Maybe it would be a different story when the techs arrived with their equipment and began fine-combing the small pathway and the flower bed under the window.</p>
         <p id="p1287">She hurried back to her car and sat down to wait. Thoughts ran through her head, all the questions she would have asked the nurse. Now it was too late. She sank down in the car seat and pulled the hood of her winter coat up around her head. She wished someone were with her.</p>
         <div class="decoration-rw" id="decoration18">
            <p class="center-rw" id="p1288">*  *  *</p>
         </div>
         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1289">Louise had expected the female head of Homicide of the Western District Police to show up with her team, which is why she was very surprised when Thomas Toft knocked on the side window of her car. She jerked up and hurriedly pulled her hood down. It had been a long time since she’d seen her old colleague from Homicide. She wondered if he had been transferred to the Glostrup police without her knowing.</p>
         <p id="p1290">“Hi,” she said, after she stepped out of the car. She was about to shake his hand when she noticed her former partner, Lars Jørgensen, and Detective Michael Stig, standing over by a white Ford. “What in the world are all of you doing here? The last time I checked, Hvidovre was in the Western District.”</p>
         <p id="p1291">Toft nodded. “When Emergency heard it might be a rifle, they contacted us. It’s the third shooting of this kind within the past two months, not counting gang shootings.”</p>
         <p id="p1292">Louise was startled. “What?”</p>
         <p id="p1293">Her old colleague nodded again. “The first homicide was our case, and when ballistics showed the same rifle was used in the second homicide, they gave us that one, too.”</p>
         <p id="p1294">“And you think Margit Østergaard could be a third victim?” Louise looked over at the house.</p>
         <p id="p1295">“We can’t know that yet,” Toft replied quickly. “But we still haven’t established a motive for the first two homicides; we haven’t even connected the two victims. So we asked to be called in on any report that could be related to the two homicides.”</p>
         <p id="p1296">Louise nodded thoughtfully. “You might be interested in a shooting in England.” She greeted Michael Stig when he walked over to them.</p>
         <p id="p1297">He had been an investigator at Homicide while Louise worked there, and it had been his knife-sharp elbows that had spurred Louise to accept Rønholt’s offer to head up a small new unit in the Search Department. Possibly it had been a step down the career ladder, but it had sounded awfully attractive when she’d heard that Stig had been promoted and would be her new boss following her old boss Willumsen’s death.</p>
         <p id="p1298">Good that she left, she thought, seeing him standing there with his meticulously knotted tie and his arrogant attitude, which had thoroughly pissed her off when they had worked together. And things probably wouldn’t have been better when it turned out that Hans Suhr was retiring and Stig would be heading up the Personal Crimes Department, still known as Homicide. Success wasn’t treating him particularly well, apparently; he was thinner and ragged at the edges. It gets lonely at the top, also in the police corps.</p>
         <p id="p1299">“What’s this about England?” he asked, ignoring Toft, who wanted to know how Louise was doing. “You’re saying the shooting of a middle-aged woman in Hvidovre has international connections?”</p>
         <p id="p1300">Louise straightened up and smiled at him, refusing to be provoked. “I didn’t say that. But as I was about to say, there<i> could</i> be a connection. The woman inside the house with the back of her head blown off has a connection to a Danish woman shot in England some weeks ago. The two homicides resemble each other, too.”</p>
         <p id="p1301">The head of Homicide approached them from the tech’s car.</p>
         <p id="p1302">“And this case resembles our first two cases,” Toft told Stig, as Louise walked over to meet Suhr.</p>
         <p id="p1303">He smiled at her. “What are you doing here? Are you transferring back to us and no one told me?”</p>
         <p id="p1304">“I’m the one who called the homicide in.” Louise explained that she had met Margit Østergaard the day before and had driven out for more information. “She’s involved in a case I’m working on.”</p>
         <p id="p1305">They stepped back onto the sidewalk when the forensic pathologist drove by. Traffic on the street was heating up, with people on their way to work, children heading for school, but many curious onlookers were standing on the sidewalk and watching from doorways. Uniformed police had set up barrier tape, technicians were at work inside the house and in the backyard. Several police officers were already taking witness statements, both from onlookers and from people in the surrounding houses.</p>
         <p id="p1306">“What’s this case you’re working on?” Suhr asked, as they walked away from the crowd.</p>
         <p id="p1307">Louise told him about Sofie Parker while considering whether to tell him about her suspicion she’d driven out to Hvidovre to confirm. “Both women were associated with a home hospice nurse service, and dying people they cared for have donated money to an account in Switzerland. Completely voluntarily. And the account was managed by Sofie Parker. That’s why we’re interested in other people who have been involved in the nurse service, because we see a motive among relatives who might not like so much money being given away.”</p>
         <p id="p1308">“Interesting,” Suhr mumbled. He seemed to clutch the straw she’d handed him that finally might connect the victims.</p>
         <p id="p1309">“There’s no question the two women were linked through the nurse service. It’s less certain they knew each other personally.” Louise decided to confide in him. “Besides all this, I suspect that the nurses not only sat with the terminally ill, but also played a part in providing them with a dignified death in their homes. That’s only my suspicion, of course; we haven’t confirmed it yet. We’re about to do another round of questioning. That’s why I came here to talk to Margit.”</p>
         <p id="p1310">“How long has your department been working on the case?”</p>
         <p id="p1311">“Since the murder of Sofie Parker.”</p>
         <p id="p1312">“But why did they contact you when they discovered the woman was Danish?” Suhr sounded confused.</p>
         <p id="p1313">Louise began to explain about Eik Nordstrøm, how he had reported Sofie missing, and that the department still had the case, since it had never been closed. “It’s a long story.”</p>
         <p id="p1314">“Sounds like you’ve made good progress in that part of the investigation. It’ll be interesting to see if the first homicides are also linked to the nurse service. What would you say to joining us on a temporary investigative team on this case? Of course I’d have to clear it with Rønholt.”</p>
         <p id="p1315">“Thanks, but I think I’ll pass.” Louise watched Michael Stig cross the street. “I’m happy at the Search Department, and anyway we can help each other on this.”</p>
         <p id="p1316">“If you suspect this has something to do with the killing in England, that makes four homicides in two months. And who says it ends here. We need to get organized to stop this.”</p>
         <p id="p1317">Louise clenched her teeth as she weighed the pros and cons of joining Suhr’s team. First and foremost she would be in the middle of an investigation quite possibly focused on hunting down a serial killer. Working again alongside Toft and Lars Jørgensen was also appealing. Suhr too. But—and it was a big but—Michael Stig headed up the team. He would be absolutely unbearable to work with if she barged in and stole some of his thunder. And he would gloat if it turned out to be a coincidence that Sofie Parker and Margit Østergaard were both involved in the home hospice nurse service. He would make her out to be an idiot.</p>
         <p id="p1318">“Call Rønholt,” she said.</p>
         <p id="p1319">This case was too serious for her to let Michael Stig stand in the way. Also, she realized it gave her the opportunity to withdraw from Eik’s case. Even though she almost had forgiven him. He had chosen to distance himself from her, and she had to respect that.</p>
         <p id="p1320">“The new team will be meeting in my office after lunch,” Suhr said, apparently confident that Rønholt wouldn’t object to his stealing one of his people. <i>And he probably won’t</i>, Louise thought, as she walked to her car.</p>
         <div class="decoration-rw" id="decoration19">
            <p class="center-rw" id="p1321">*  *  *</p>
         </div>
         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1322">It was like déjà vu as Louise logged on to the computer in her old office and sat down across from Lars Jørgensen. Her former partner’s bulletin board was up to date with photos of his Bolivian twins; they had grown from a pair of charming, mischievous terrorists to a pair of healthy adolescents. Louise hadn’t seen them for a year, and they looked twice as tall now.</p>
         <p id="p1323">Toft sat at the end of the desk. An e-cigarette stuck up out of his checkered shirt pocket. He had been one of Headquarters’ hard-core smokers, but a total smoking ban had chased all the nicotine addicts down to the street every time they had to have a smoke.</p>
         <p id="p1324">“How will it be when you move out to Teglholmen?” Louise asked. “Will there be smoking balconies or cabinets?”</p>
         <p id="p1325">Toft peered at her over his glasses. “When’s the last time you heard of anyone taking smokers into account when they plan new offices?”</p>
         <p id="p1326">She smiled. “Poor you, having to go down to the wharf.”</p>
         <p id="p1327">As yet, no one knew what it would be like when Copenhagen Police moved into the new building by the Fisketorvet mall, but there had been talk. The Personal Crimes Department was one of the departments slated to move. Louise had expected her old colleagues would be sad about leaving Police Headquarters, but it sounded as if they were looking forward to it. She understood them; no one denied the old historic building needed a thorough renovation.</p>
         <p id="p1328">Michael Stig walked in carrying a cup of coffee. Louise offered to find him a chair, but he said he wasn’t staying long.</p>
         <p id="p1329">“We were just about to check where we are on the first cases,” Toft told his young boss, who sat on the bookshelf just inside the door. He’d set his coffee down, and now he was drumming his pen against his thigh.</p>
         <p id="p1330">Louise started by telling what she knew about the murder of Sofie Parker. “Shot through the kitchen window. No witnesses other than the daughter, who is missing. No motive.”</p>
         <p id="p1331">She sketched out the family’s situation, the daughter, the husband, and the past history in Denmark.</p>
         <p id="p1332">“How long had Sofie Parker been missing?” Toft asked.</p>
         <p id="p1333">“Since disappearing in 1996 and up until recently.” She told them about the email Eik had received. She added that the Swiss bank account was the only thing linking Sofie Parker with Denmark.</p>
         <p id="p1334">Michael Stig nodded as she spoke, as if he had heard it all before. “And the child’s father is the Danish man the English police arrested for murder.”</p>
         <p id="p1335">Louise was surprised. He’d wasted no time in getting up to date.</p>
         <p id="p1336">“Eik Nordstrøm,” he continued, “is the man you share an office and an apartment with.” He looked over at Toft and Lars Jørgensen. “I told Suhr it’s a bad idea for Rick to work with us on this case.”</p>
         <p id="p1337">Louise detested him, but she fought to keep her head down, and her feelings under control. “We don’t live together, but it’s true that we were in a relationship. And I’m not involved in his case.”</p>
         <p id="p1338">“No?” Stig asked.</p>
         <p id="p1339">“The English police are working on it.” She stood up to face him eye to eye. “The case on my desk is still the case the Search Department opened after the disappearance of Sofie Bygmann. I’ve been asked to find out what she did from the time she disappeared from the boat until she showed up in England. That’s what I’m involved in. And we did find out, in fact.”</p>
         <p id="p1340">“Let’s hear it.” He nodded at her.</p>
         <p id="p1341">Having to justify taking part in the investigation annoyed Louise, when Suhr was the one who had headhunted her. “She went to Switzerland to work at a suicide clinic.” She explained about the home hospice nurse service and the donations, which they presumed that Sofie Parker had managed.</p>
         <p id="p1342">“I believe the nurse service is actually an organization providing assisted suicide,” she said. “I would have spoken to Margit Østergaard about it, but obviously I arrived too late. And the motive for the killings could be that someone feels they’ve been cheated out of an inheritance. Some of the donations to the organization are big.”</p>
         <p id="p1343">“And this organization was supposedly led by the woman shot in England.” Stig sounded doubtful. He asked what she had on the homicide in Nailsea.</p>
         <p id="p1344">“It’s all in here.” She slid the file onto the desk.</p>
         <p id="p1345">Stig opened the file, leafed forward to the description of the murder weapon, and read for a few moments before looking up at Louise. “This makes it look like we have a perpetrator.” He fanned the air with the file. “I’ll have our technicians compare this rifle with what we’ve already examined. It’ll be interesting to hear Eik Nordstrøm’s explanation.”</p>
         <p id="p1346">Now she was irritated. “Like everyone else, he’s innocent until proven guilty!”</p>
         <p id="p1347">“But he can’t be ruled out, either.” He gave her a condescending look, as if <i>she </i>were the one he was looking to take down.</p>
         <p id="p1348">Louise bit her tongue.</p>
         <p id="p1349">Stig stood up and turned to Lars Jørgensen. “Call me when you’re caught up on what we’ve got. But send me a few emails along the way, so I’ll know where you’re at.” He left with her file tucked underneath his arm.</p>
         <p id="p1350">Louise caught the look her former partner gave Toft. “What?”</p>
         <p id="p1351">Jørgensen shook his head slightly. “It doesn’t exactly save us time, emailing him about everything said after he leaves. It would be a lot easier for all of us if he just stayed and listened.”</p>
         <p id="p1352">“You mean you sit there and email him, every time something is said he might want to hear? That he would have heard if he’d been here?” Louise couldn’t believe it.</p>
         <p id="p1353">Jørgensen looked over at Toft, who shrugged. “You have to choose your battles.”</p>
         <div class="decoration-rw" id="decoration20">
            <p class="center-rw" id="p1354">*  *  *</p>
         </div>
         <p class="firstpara-rw" id="p1355">“Helle Frederiksen, forty-five, lived in Tårnby,” Toft said, as he began going through the Danish homicide cases. “Shot in the head and killed on November 19. The shot was fired through the living room window from just under eight meters. The weapon was a hunting rifle, the perpetrator must have been out on the street. No footprints found in the hedge or on the lawn. No unaccounted fingerprints in the house. A boyfriend lives in Oslo; he came down to visit when their days off matched up. We corroborated his alibi, he was at work. A sister has a key to the house, her prints are of course inside, too. She was home with her husband and children, working at her computer.”</p>
         <p id="p1356">“All we have is what the techs found,” Jørgensen said. “She was a healthcare aide, well-liked. Outgoing, worked out in the local fitness center, ran twice a week with a few coworkers. During the winter she taught cooking at an evening school.” He threw up his arms.</p>
         <p id="p1357">“Are her parents alive?” Louise asked, thinking of Sofie.</p>
         <p id="p1358">Jørgensen nodded. “They live in Tårnby, too, not far from her. Her sister lives close by in Kastrup.”</p>
         <p id="p1359">“Healthcare aide,” Louise said, “that’s a perfect fit. She might have joined the nurse service.”</p>
         <p id="p1360">“We need to ask her sister if she knows anything about that,” Toft said. “I’ll handle it. I was out there a few times right after it happened.”</p>
         <p id="p1361">“Who’s the second victim?” Louise asked.</p>
         <p id="p1362">“Niels Boe, a master carpenter from Lynge. Lived alone on a farm on the outskirts of town. Shot in his living room with a hunting rifle, and according to ballistics it was the one used in Tårnby. The homicide in Lynge took place five weeks ago.”</p>
         <p id="p1363">Louise was surprised. “I can’t recall hearing about any connection between the two homicides.”</p>
         <p id="p1364">Toft shook his head. “You didn’t hear about it. When we found out it was the same murder weapon, we shut the lid on the Lynge case. We questioned family and friends. Spoke with the two workers employed by the victim, went through all his business connections. Nothing pointed to a motive or any link to Helle Frederiksen. Just as nothing in the investigation of her murder pointed to any connection to the carpenter.”</p>
         <p id="p1365">“But,” Jørgensen said, “we don’t believe they were chosen randomly by some crazy killer. That’s why we showed up so soon when we heard about the homicide this morning.”</p>
         <p id="p1366">Louise leaned her elbows on the desk and folded her hands under her chin. “Two things. We need to look for some link to the home hospice nurse service. If we find one, we’d better find the others associated with the service, damn quick. I’m beginning to think someone out there is picking them off one by one.”</p>
         <p id="p1367">Jørgensen nodded, but Toft seemed more skeptical. “It still could be coincidental that the two women in England and Hvidovre knew about the service. We’re not even sure they knew each other.”</p>
         <p id="p1368">“That’s true.” Louise was about to say more, when the door opened and Stig stuck his head inside. “They’ve just extended the custody period in England. The suspect doesn’t have an alibi for the homicide. Find everything you can on Eik Nordstrøm.”</p>
         <p id="p1369">Louise jumped up. “What the hell! He’s not the one we’re looking for.”</p>
         <p id="p1370">Suhr showed up in the doorway.</p>
         <p id="p1371">She couldn’t believe her ears. “You can’t be serious. We’re supposed to spend time and resources checking one of our colleagues, while the perpetrator goes about his business? For Chrissake, Eik is in jail in Bristol, he can’t have shot a woman in Hvidovre this morning; use your head!”</p>
         <p id="p1372">“Point taken!” Jørgensen said.</p>
         <p id="p1373">“But we still don’t know if she was shot with the same weapon, and until we do we’re going to ignore that case and focus on what we do know.” Stig was short of breath. “And what we do know is, the hunting rifle used to kill Helle Frederiksen and Niels Boe was used in another homicide, the one Eik Nordstrøm is being held for. That’s a fact, and that’s what we’re going to investigate.”</p>
         <p id="p1374">Louise ignored Stig and looked at Suhr. “How quick can Ballistics finish if we light a fire under them?”</p>
         <p id="p1375">The Homicide chief nodded. “They’re working on it.”</p>
         <p id="p1376">Stig drummed his fingers against the door frame, impatient to leave. Beads of sweat stood out on his forehead.</p>
         <p id="p1377">“Do you have a moment?” Louise asked Suhr, after Stig had left. He nodded, and she followed him out into the hall.</p>
         <p id="p1378">“If this is how it’s going to be,” she said, angry now, “I’m going back to the Search Department to find out if Helle Frederiksen and Niels Boe had any ties to the nurse service. Maybe everyone here thinks it’s a shot in the dark, but show me one other thing that links these cases together!”</p>
         <p id="p1379">Suhr lifted his hand. “Easy now.”</p>
         <p id="p1380">“It’s totally okay that you investigate other angles,” she said, ignoring his admonition. “But I’m out if we don’t work fast to uncover any connection between the victims and the nurse service. And if there is, priority number one must be to find out how many people are at risk of having their heads blown off in their living rooms.”</p>
         <p id="p1381">Her eyes pleaded with him. “We have to identify them, to stop this from happening again. We need to work together to find them quickly, everyone with some work-related link to the service, and how many nurses are involved. Are there others on the business side, doctors involved in providing the lethal medicine? Undertakers? We have to identify the people in danger of being killed.”</p>
         <p id="p1382">Suhr nodded. Finally her heart slowed, and her voice was calm now. “Or else we work separately. In which case Olle and I will focus on talking to all the relatives of those who made deposits, and we’ll contact the home hospice nurse service, too.”</p>
         <p id="p1383">Suhr nodded again and waited to be sure she was finished. “I agree. We have to follow up on your lead.”</p>
         <p id="p1384">“Of course we have to consider other motives,” Louise quickly added. “But I’m already involved in this case, and that’s what I’m going to concentrate on. So it’s your decision if it’s with you or my own department.”</p>
         <p id="p1385">Once more he nodded, and he stuck his hands in his pockets. “We’ll do it here. Right now I have twenty men working on the homicide in Hvidovre. I’m putting Stig in charge of them, even though he has a lot on his plate. So you, Jørgensen, and Toft will follow your lead. I can’t spare any more officers, you three will be on your own.”</p>
         <p id="p1386">“Fine.” Three was better than one, and she understood that Margit’s murder required every body he could scrape up. Now the three of them could go to work and find the motive.</p>
