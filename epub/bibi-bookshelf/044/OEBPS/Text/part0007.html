<p class="para">This book never could have been imagined or written without the willingness of the clients featured in the vignettes to share their stories and pain in therapy. It is with great appreciation and respect that I express my deepest thanks for their trust, candor and commitment.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">Also, many thanks to <em class="calibre6">The New Yorker</em> for working with me so that I could use some of their excellent cartoons to add humor and spice to <em class="calibre6">Running on Empty</em>.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">To write this book, I have needed to rely on the tremendous knowledge and support of my family, friends and colleagues. I would like to thank a few of the many people who have kept me going, and helped me throughout this process.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">First, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Denise Waldron, who took countless hours away from writing her own book to read and edit this manuscript. Deniseâ€™s eye for detail was invaluable. She continually amazed me by catching the large and small inconsistencies and errors, and helping me to set them right.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">Second, I wish to thank Joanie Schaffner, LICSW, Dr. Danielle DeTora, and Nicholas Brown for their excellent feedback and ideas for how to make the manuscript better; Michael Feinstein for offering his business savvy at times when I was making complicated and difficult decisions; and my agent, Michael Ebeling, for believing in my book and in me, and for guiding me through the complicated publishing process.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">Dr. Scott Creighton, Catherine Bergh, Patrice and Chuck Abernathy, David Hornstein and Nancy Fitzgerald Heckman each offered a special <a id="page_xiv" class="calibre3"></a>boost when I needed it, by listening, caring, advising, or asking favors of others to help make this book happen.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">Lastly, I want to express my heartfelt love and appreciation to my husband, Seth Davis and my two children, Lydia and Isaac, for willingly weathering my long hours of researching and writing, and for never letting me doubt myself. There is no way I could have written this book without their support and unwavering confidence sustaining me.</p>
