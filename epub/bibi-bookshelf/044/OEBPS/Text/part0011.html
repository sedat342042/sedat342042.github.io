<h3 class="h3a"><span class="line">TWELVE WAYS TO END UP EMPTY</span></h3>
<p class="para1">There are an infinite number of ways for a parent to fail a child emotionally. There are so many that it would be impossible to cover them all in this book. What we can do is take a look at the most pertinent categories of parents. Please read this with an understanding that your particular parents may have traits from one type combined with traits of another. Even if you think you have your parents pegged after reading the first type, it may be helpful to read all the way to the end of the chapter. It’s entirely possible that you’ll see something in Type 9 that you’ve experienced yourself after having already identified your parents as Type 5, for example. All of these examples are meant to be “mix-and-match,” although the majority of parents fit predominantly into one identifiable type.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">I’ve saved the largest category for the end: the Well-Meaning-But-Neglected-Themselves parents. This category talks about the many, many parents who fail their child emotionally, but who have all the best of intentions. They have their children’s best interests in mind. They love their children genuinely and truly. They just don’t know how to give their children what they need. If you read Type 1 through Type 11 and none of them seem right, it’s very possible that you were raised by WMBNT parents.</p>
<h4 class="h"><a id="page_14" class="calibre1"></a><a id="chapter02section01" class="calibre1"></a>Type 1: The Narcissistic Parent</h4>
<p class="para">Perhaps you are familiar with the Greek myth of Narcissus, from which the word “narcissistic” is derived. In the myth, Narcissus was a strikingly handsome young man whose looks dazzled all who knew him. Many praised him and fell in love with him, but he was so vain that he rejected them all. No one was good enough for him! Eventually, Narcissus saw and fell in love with his reflection in a pool of water. Unable to walk away from his own image, he either committed suicide or wasted away, depending on the version of the myth.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">Narcissistic people are a lot like their namesake. Most of the time, they run on a full tank of superiority, confidence and charisma. But sometimes narcissists recognize that their sense of superiority to others is an illusion. Therefore, they gravitate towards evidence that confirms that sense of superiority, and they avoid interactions or relationships that provide evidence to the contrary. When someone or something shatters their grandiose sense of themselves, they become difficult. Despite their arrogance, they’re easily hurt and emotionally weak. They hold grudges, blame failures on others, banish people to the doghouse, and tantrum when things don’t go their way. They don’t like to be wrong. They like to hear themselves talk. But perhaps their most damaging trait is that they often judge others and find them sadly lacking. They are the Kings and Queens of any family, office or enterprise.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">You can imagine that when narcissists become parents, they demand perfection from their children or at the very least, no embarrassment. While healthy parents may cringe a little when their child fails to catch the fly ball in the big game, the narcissist parent of that child is angry and feels personally humiliated. When their children make mistakes that are visible to others—no matter how much they may need their parents’ help at that time—narcissists take it personally and make their children pay.</p>
<p class="center-paral"><a id="page_15" class="calibre3"></a>SID</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">Nineteen-year-old Sid is standing at the front door of his wealthy parents’ well-appointed home. He is a tall, handsome young man at first glance. But look into his eyes and you see pain and uncertainty. His hands are clasped in front of him and his shoulders slightly hunched. A policeman stands beside him and rings the doorbell. The policeman and the young man wait for several minutes until an elegant woman opens the door. She gives the policeman a charming smile and thanks him for bringing her son home, takes the paperwork that he hands her, and steps aside to let her son enter. The policeman leaves. Sid’s mother closes the front door and for a moment stands in front of her son, with arms folded, a firm, impenetrable look on her face. Sid leans slightly toward her, as if wanting, or perhaps hoping, for physical contact.</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">She says, “Your father is very upset. You can’t talk to him now. He went to bed. Go sleep in your old room and we will discuss this in the morning.”</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">Has Sid been caught drinking? Or has he done something more serious, stealing perhaps?</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">No. Sid, who hasn’t been driving long, has just hit and critically injured a pedestrian with his car. He has just hit a man who had been dashing across a busy street to catch the bus, a man in his forties with a family. He is now in the hospital in a coma. <strong class="calibre4">And Sid’s mother sends him to his room</strong>. She is upset because she knows that tomorrow his name will be in the paper, bringing shame to the family.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="indent-para1">Narcissistic parents don’t really recognize their children as people separate from them. Instead, they see their children as little extensions of themselves. The needs of the child are defined by the needs of the parent, and the child who tries to express his needs is often accused of being selfish or inconsiderate.</p>
<p class="center-paral"><a id="page_16" class="calibre3"></a>BEATRICE</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">Beatrice was a bright fourteen-year-old African American girl who got a full scholarship to a renowned and prestigious private high school in her town. Most of the students were so rich that they travelled to places like Monte Carlo or the Swiss Alps on school breaks. But Beatrice was a “townie” whose parents had to save just to take her to Disney World or Cape Cod once a year. At her new school, her grades were fine, as usual. But she was miserable all year, feeling like the token black, the token townie and most of all like she didn’t belong.</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">Throughout the school year, however, Beatrice’s mother was in heaven. She loved dressing up and going to school events to rub shoulders with Senators and Wall Street parents. She loved talking to her neighbors about how difficult the school was, and how well Beatrice was doing. She felt that she was finally socializing with the type of people that interested her. Whenever Beatrice tried to express her social misery, her mother would exclaim, “This is a wonderful opportunity for you to be super-successful in life! It’s only 4 years. You just need to toughen up!” Beatrice tried to take her mother’s words to heart, but she was lonely, depressed and had little in common with the other students. When she told her parents at the end of the school year that she was going back to her public school, her mother blew up, burst into tears and shouted, “How could you do this <strong class="calibre4">to me</strong>? Now I won’t see all my wonderful friends there! And our neighbors will be so glad you failed because they were jealous of me! You’re doing all of this because you are nothing but a selfish drama queen!” Beatrice’s dad was no help. He had learned it was best to side with mom.</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">What Beatrice needed was compassion and understanding. What she got was shame. For a very long time, her mother had a hard time forgiving her for a choice which, by the way, <a id="page_17" class="calibre3"></a>proved to be the right one for Beatrice. She graduated from public school with a full scholarship to Brown, and her mother was happy again.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="indent-para1">What the narcissistic parent lacks is the ability to imagine or care about what her children feel. A parent without empathy is like a surgeon operating with dull tools in poor lighting. The results are likely to produce scarring.</p>
<p class="center-paral">ZEKE</p>
<p class="indent-para1">Back to Zeke, the third grader who in Chapter 1 disrespected his teacher and was sent home with a note. Here’s the interaction he might have with his mother if she were a narcissist:</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">Zeke hands his mother the note. She reads it and Zeke sees her muscles tensing, her jaw tightening and a flush stealing up her neck. She shakes the note in Zeke’s face: “How could you do this, Zeke? Now Ms. Rollo will think I’ve not taught you good manners! This is embarrassing. Go to your room. I don’t want to see you right now. I’m very hurt.”</em></p>
</div>
<p class="indent-para1">Zeke’s mother took his misbehavior personally, as if he had done it <strong class="calibre4">to her.</strong> She’s not concerned about Zeke, his feelings or his behavior. This is all about her. Therefore, he got no useful advice or feedback about how to get along at school.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">When narcissists become parents, they are apt to have very different relationships with each of their children. They play favorites and often find at least one of their children a disappointment. But the one child who reflects them well, by being handsome or pretty or athletic or intelligent, is the “anointed one” and enjoys a special relationship with narcissist mommy or daddy. It is sometimes only in adulthood that the favored child of a narcissist realizes that her parent’s love has been conditional all along.</p>
<p class="center-paral"><a id="page_18" class="calibre3"></a>GINA</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">Gina is a 32-year-old woman, the oldest of three children from an old Manhattan family. Up until very recently, she has been the apple of her father’s eye and has enjoyed a good, close relationship with him. Yet her younger brother, who has always been less successful than she, keeps his distance from their father, and also from Gina herself. Gina has never understood why that is and chalks it up to her brother being jealous. Now, however, Gina is getting married to a second-generation immigrant man, a successful lawyer at her law firm. He is a man, however, whom her father feels is beneath her. Since their engagement, her father is cold to her and avoids her calls. When they do talk, he uses that critical tone that Gina has always heard being directed at her brother. Gina understands that she is disappointing her father. At age 32, she’s finally able to see why her brother has detached himself from the family.</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">With this new awareness, Gina may go forward in life distancing from her father. But she may always subconsciously try to please him, to be better than the rest and to gather accolades and praise just for him. She is trapped in her father’s mirror. Throughout childhood, her own identity was neglected while she toiled to fulfill her father’s grandiose ideas of what a perfect daughter she was. Whether the child of the narcissist feels hated growing up, like Gina’s brother, or feels loved, as Gina did, in adulthood that long-ago child will struggle to free himself from the narcissist’s judgment. He will struggle to see himself through his own eyes.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="indent-para1">I’m sure you’re starting to get the idea. Emotionally neglectful parenting can look a lot like healthy parenting at first glance. But the differences are dramatic. Just as in the forest one mushroom can be dinner and the other can be deadly, the similarities are on the surface alone. The coming chapters will teach you how to recognize the various <a id="page_19" class="calibre3"></a>poisonous mushrooms, how to become fully alive, and how to pass that strength and knowledge on to the next generation.</p>
<h4 class="h"><a id="chapter02section02" class="calibre1"></a>Type 2: The Authoritarian Parent</h4>
<p class="para">In 1966, the psychologist Dr. Diana Baumrind was the first to identify and describe “The Authoritarian Parent.” Dr. Baumrind described authoritarian parents as rule-bound, restrictive and punitive, raising their children based upon very inflexible and unbending demands. The phrases most likely to come to mind when considering authoritarian parents are:</p>
<p class="indent-para1">“Old school”</p>
<p class="indent-para1">“Children are meant to be seen and not heard”</p>
<p class="indent-para1">“Spare the rod, spoil the child”</p>
<p class="indent-para1">If you are a Baby Boomer (born between 1946 and 1964) or older, you have a better chance of having been raised by authoritarian parents. This parenting style was more popular among parents of that era. Today’s parents tend to adopt a much more open and permissive approach, often fueled by a conscious decision NOT to raise their own children as they themselves were raised. However, there are certainly plenty of authoritarian parents still in existence.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">Authoritarian parents require a lot from their children. The children are expected to follow their parents’ rules without questioning them. At the same time, these parents don’t explain the reasons behind their rules. They simply require adherence, and crack down harshly when the child doesn’t comply. Authoritarian parents are more likely to punish or spank rather than they are to discuss a problem or issue with their child. They are not particularly concerned with the feelings or ideas of the child. They parent according to a template they have in their own heads of what a generic child’s behavior should be, and do not take into account the individual needs, temperament or feelings of their particular child.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">Most abusive parents fall into the authoritarian category. However, Dr. Baumrind is careful to point out that <strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre6">not all authoritarian parents are abusive.</em></strong> I, however, would venture to say that <strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre6">all authoritarian parents are by definition emotionally neglectful.</em></strong></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><a id="page_20" class="calibre3"></a>Many authoritarian parents tend to equate the child’s obedience with love. In other words, if the child quietly and thoroughly obeys the parent, the parent feels loved. Unfortunately, the converse is also true. If the child questions the parent’s demand, the parent feels not only disrespected but also rejected. If the child blatantly disobeys, the parent feels all of that plus more. He also feels thoroughly unloved. To understand how this works, let’s look in on Sophia.</p>
<p class="center-paral">SOPHIA</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">Sophia is a beautiful, vivacious 19-year-old woman. Her 62-year-old father is old-school Italian. He loves his only child fiercely, and he expects respect and love from her in return. It is Christmas Eve, and Sophia’s family is gathering for the annual Christmas party. Sophia has despised this party for years, as she has no siblings or cousins her age, and she perceives her aunts and uncles as “boring, stuffy and pretentious.” At these parties, she feels like an ornament on display. She is presented and evaluated by all the family, and then dismissed and ignored.</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">This year, Sophia is invited to go to her new boyfriend’s house for Christmas Eve with his family. She’s excited about the prospect of meeting his parents for the first time and what this means for the relationship moving forward. Also, she feels it will be a much warmer, interesting and exciting way to spend this special night.</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">When Sophia, with great trepidation, tells her father of her plan, he becomes enraged. “You cannot disrespect me this way. What will your aunts and uncles think? They’ll think you don’t love them. Is this how you show appreciation for all I’ve done for you? All I ask is one dinner one time a year, and you’re too selfish even to deliver that.” When Sophia doesn’t immediately fold to his wishes, her father tells her not to bother coming over on Christmas Day. “I’ll be returning your gifts, and you can spend Christmas Day with your boyfriend too.” At this point, <a id="page_21" class="calibre3"></a>Sophia feels so guilty and bereft that she agrees to change her plan and follow her father’s wishes. She can’t bear the thought of spending Christmas Day alone</em>.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent-para1">Sophia’s father responded so harshly because he felt completely spurned and utterly unloved by his daughter. Her willful breaking of his rules was experienced as rejection, disrespect and a lack of caring, whereas it was actually driven by three healthy and positive things: her love for her boyfriend, her excitement about the future, and her natural and normal need to start building her own life. In effect, Sophia’s father is inadvertently “training” her to put her own healthy needs aside in order to fulfill his need to feel loved.</p>
<p class="center-paral">JOSEPH</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">Joseph is ten, the oldest of five siblings, and today is Halloween. Every Halloween of Joseph’s short life, the family has followed the same ritual. They have hot dogs and beans at 6:00 p.m. After dinner, the children are finally allowed to don their costumes, although they have been begging to do so since the morning.</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">Each year Joseph’s mother and grandmother choose a theme for the costumes and sew them themselves. This year, all 5 children are Power Rangers. Joseph, being the oldest, is embarrassed, because he feels he has outgrown Power Rangers. He is worrying about his friends seeing him in such a babyish costume and teasing him about it at school tomorrow. Also, he really wanted to be Harry Potter this year. Joseph would never question the costume choice or ask his mother to be Harry Potter, however, because he knows this would make his mother very angry with him for not appreciating the hard work she and his grandmother put into sewing the costumes. So Joseph tries hard not to think about the costume. He puts <a id="page_22" class="calibre3"></a>it out of his mind, and is able to be excited to trick-or-treat despite being a Power Ranger.</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">Joseph’s parents are very strict about the trick-or-treating process. The children are allowed to go to the same seven houses in their neighborhood every year. They are to walk in order of age, youngest first, so that their mother can keep track of them. While walking down the street between houses, Joseph spots two friends down the street trick-or-treating together and impulsively runs ahead, waving and yelling their names. Joseph’s mother, who is trying to keep track of all five children and keep order, reacts immediately, grabbing his arm and jerking him back to the end of the line, where he belongs. “No more trick-or-treating for you tonight,” she admonishes. “Since you can’t control yourself, you can stand back with me while your brothers and sisters go to the rest of the houses. Maybe that will help you remember to behave yourself next year.”</em></p>
</div>
<p class="indent-para1">Joseph’s mother provides a good example of the authoritarian parent. She did not consider Joseph’s (or, for that matter, any of the children’s) age in deciding the costume and treated all five children as if they were the same age. She was not interested in what Joseph wanted to be for Halloween, finding it easier to make five identical costumes. Her rules are strict and unbending and when Joseph unwittingly breaks them, the consequence is harsh.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">We could give Joseph’s mom a bit of a pass considering that she had 5 young children to keep track of while trick-or-treating. It could be that her authoritarian ways are based on a desperate attempt to manage five small children. It’s important to note, though, that whatever the reasons for her behaviors, they will still have the same effect on Joseph. He is learning that having needs and wishes is selfish and that he’s to keep his wishes, needs, and feelings to himself. He’s also learning that he is not important. When Joseph enters adolescence, he will be at higher risk of rebellious behavior, and as an adult, he will be very likely to have signs of Emotional Neglect.</p>
<p class="indent-para1"><a id="page_23" class="calibre3"></a>Some authoritarian parenting comes in a more subtle package:</p>
<p class="center-paral">RENEE</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">Renee told me in one of our first therapy sessions, “I was a difficult child. I was always getting into trouble. When I look back, I feel sorry for my parents.” When I asked Renee more about this, here’s what I learned:</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">Renee’s father was “somewhat of a stickler” (Renee’s words). He expected his children to help around the house. He would often come home from work and notice that, for example, the kitchen floor was dirty. “Renee, come and mop this floor!” he would yell. If Renee was in the middle of her homework, she would, very reasonably, try to finish writing her sentence or her arithmetic problem before jumping up. This brief delay was interpreted by her father as disobedience. “When I say come mop the floor, I mean NOW, not 5 minutes from now!” he would yell. This was the case no matter what the task and no matter what Renee was doing at the time her father yelled for her. Needless to say, Renee was often “in trouble.”</em></p>
</div>
<p class="indent-para1">You might notice that Renee’s father did not give her such a strict punishment as some of the other authoritarian parents. He didn’t ground her or banish her from Christmas. In fact, what he did would be considered normal by many people’s standards. What parent doesn’t yell at times? The problem with Renee’s dad was that his yelling was loud, and it was mean. It was powered by the <em class="calibre6">feeling</em> that his daughter, by not reacting immediately to his demand, did not love him. He was trying to get his needs met (the need to feel respected and loved) and convey to Renee that she’d better do as he says.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">Unfortunately, what he actually did was convey to her that her needs were not only inconsequential but also offensive. Renee blamed herself for <a id="page_24" class="calibre3"></a>having unacceptable needs rather than her father for being unreasonable. She was essentially being sentenced to a lifetime of self-blame and self-directed anger. Fortunately, Renee found her way to therapy where she was able to learn to accept that it is okay for her to have her own feelings and needs.</p>
<p class="center-paral">ZEKE</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">Zeke rides the school bus home with visions of tomorrow’s football game dancing in his head. His father was finally able to get Patriots tickets and is taking Zeke to one of their games for the first time. Zeke has never been more excited!</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">As soon as Zeke arrives home, he hands his mother the note. As she reads it, her face takes on an expression of devastated hurt mixed with anger. “This is unacceptable. You need to learn how to show proper respect! You don’t deserve to go to the football game tomorrow. Maybe next time you’ll remember to respect Mrs. Rollo.”</em></p>
</div>
<p class="indent-para1">Obviously Zeke’s mother has cracked down hard. She took no time to hear his version of events or to teach him anything about how to manage his emotions or function in a school environment. In place of all of that, she’s taught him that as a rule, <em class="calibre6">he</em> doesn’t matter. All that matters is respecting authority by following it blindly. Even as Zeke grows up and hopefully gets the message from other people in other situations (a teacher, a friend, his wife) that <em class="calibre6">he does</em> matter, he will still carry a deep-seated tendency to blame himself when things go wrong, and also to be very hard on himself when he makes a mistake.</p>
<h4 class="h"><a id="chapter02section03" class="calibre1"></a>Type 3: The Permissive Parent</h4>
<p class="para">The permissive parent could be considered the polar opposite of the authoritarian in many ways. The permissive parent’s motto is “Don’t worry, be happy.” In our culture, these types of parents are portrayed as beloved and quirky. Think of Dharma’s hippy parents on <em class="calibre6">Dharma and Greg</em>, Homer Simpson, Stewie’s mother on <em class="calibre6">Family Guy</em>, or Dennis the Menace’s pipe-smoking, laid-back dad. The permissive parent could be described as taking the path of least resistance. At best, they just want their children to be happy. At worst, they simply don’t want to have to do the work of parenting. Either way, they do not provide their children with limits, structure, or, in adolescence, a strong adult presence against which the child can rebel. Saying “no” takes energy. Forcing one’s child to do a chore or task takes energy. Dealing with an angry child takes energy. Being momentarily hated by your child for saying no is painful. The permissive parent finds it easier to do the chores himself than to make the child do them. And to look the other way or make excuses for the child when he gets into trouble.</p>
<p class="image1"><a id="page_25" class="calibre1"></a><img src="../Images/00005.jpeg" alt="Image" class="calibre10"/></p>
<p class="indent-para1">Permissive parents are often seen as very loving by their children. This is because permissive parents stir up very little conflict with their <a id="page_26" class="calibre3"></a>children. They simply don’t say “no” often enough. Many of these parents have great discomfort with conflict in general, and have their own struggles with self-discipline. To help us understand the permissive parenting style, let’s look in on Samantha’s “idyllic” childhood.</p>
<p class="center-paral">SAMANTHA</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">Samantha was the envy of the neighborhood. When all the neighbor kids were called in to dinner one by one, Samantha was free to go in last. When Samantha didn’t feel like going to school, she was allowed to take a day off by simply requesting it. When Samantha didn’t want to go to bed, it wasn’t a problem. She was permitted to choose her own bedtime. Samantha’s parents believed that children should have complete freedom, and that this would help them grow up to be happy adults. And indeed Samantha was very happy at home. She rarely clashed with her parents, and as she got older, she simply was seldom home.</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">At school, however, there were problems. Everyone knew that Samantha was very bright and capable of making excellent grades. However, her teachers found her to be quite difficult. They described her as spoiled, undisciplined and underachieving. She had difficulty following rules and was a behavioral problem in class. She tended to miss test days. So, not surprisingly, her grades were well below her potential.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="indent-para1">You can see how Samantha, as an adult looking back, would feel that her parents were wonderful. “I never felt anything other than fully supported by them,” she said in her first therapy session with me 15 years later. By that point Samantha was working as the manager of a mall clothing store. She was blaming herself for her lack of a college degree. “I had every opportunity,” she said. “My parents would have paid for me to go to college, but I threw all that away. I don’t understand what’s wrong <a id="page_27" class="calibre3"></a>with me.” Samantha had no idea that her parents’ permissive style had not prepared her for dealing with the requirements of the real world. She was living with a distorted view of her childhood, so had no ability to understand herself or her struggles.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">Not all permissive parents are remembered with fondness. As an adult, Audrey, below, had a complete lack of relationship with her parents and a lot of anger at herself. Read on.</p>
<p class="center-paral">AUDREY</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">Audrey turned thirteen right at the time that her parents were getting divorced. Her mother was fed up with her father’s drinking and cheating, and had finally kicked him out. He moved in quickly with another woman, and Audrey was left to live with her mother and younger sister. Audrey’s mother immediately met another man, who moved in with them. Audrey’s mother was giddily in love and extremely focused on her new relationship.</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">When Audrey realized that neither of her parents was paying attention to her comings and goings, she was thrilled. She began running with a group of older kids, smoking pot and drinking. Audrey’s mother realized that she was seldom home, but this was OK with her because it gave her mother more time with her boyfriend.</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">When Audrey was caught at school with pot in her jacket pocket, she told her mother she was just holding it for a friend. Her mother readily accepted this explanation, relieved that her child wasn’t using pot. It was much easier to accept Audrey’s lame defense than put the effort into investigating, watching, and cracking down on the out-of-control Audrey. By the time she was 18, Audrey had had an abortion (unbeknownst to either of her parents), and had failed numerous high school courses despite having a high IQ.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="indent-para1"><a id="page_28" class="calibre3"></a>As an adult looking back, Audrey blamed herself for all of these difficulties. Her parents’ near-complete absence in her adolescent years fooled her into thinking that her parents had no influence upon her, either positive or negative. Who, then, could be to blame other than herself? It’s hard to see that what’s NOT THERE can be more important than what IS there. She had no idea that between her absent father and preoccupied mother, no one had taken the time and energy to actually parent her.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">Audrey as a teen, and also as an adult, was making a mistake in her thinking that many people make. Remember that Audrey was delighted at age 13 that no one was watching and saying no or making rules for her? Samantha also was pleased to have no rules. It’s natural for adolescents to crave freedom. They’re trying to forge their identities and to separate from their parents. The important thing to keep in mind is that while adolescents crave freedom, it is not healthy for them to get too much of it. Adolescents need a strong parent against whom they can rebel. They learn how to make good decisions and manage their impulses by bumping up against a parent’s rules and consequences. Unfortunately for Audrey, she had none of this.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">Another pitfall of having permissive parents: the child doesn’t get enough feedback from her parents. She is left to figure out for herself what she can expect from herself: what she’s good at, what her weaknesses are, what she should strive for. To understand this better, let’s talk about Eli.</p>
<p class="center-paral">ELI</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">Eli came home from 5<sup class="calibre14">th</sup> grade with his report card. He had five C’s and two D’s. His mother opened it, looked at it, and sadly shook her head. “Well, I’m sure you did your best,” she said with a sigh. Eli, greatly relieved in the moment, ran outside to play. Despite his relief, though, he had an uneasy feeling running under the surface while he played. “She said I did my best. That means she doesn’t think I can do any better.”</em></p>
</div>
<p class="indent-para1"><a id="page_29" class="calibre3"></a>Since Eli’s mother didn’t require or expect much from him, he grew up not requiring much from himself. His mother’s permissive style made it easy for him to do the minimum amount of work. And her permissive feedback gave him a message that his mother may not even have intended. By taking the path of least resistance, she taught him not to expect or demand much from himself because he’s not capable of delivering anyway.</p>
<p class="center-paral">ZEKE</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">Zeke handed his mother the note. A barely perceptible shadow crossed her face but was quickly replaced by a brightening. She picked up a football that Zeke had left on the kitchen counter earlier, pointed toward the living room and said, “Go long!” Zeke ran to catch the ball. When he caught it, his mom jumped up and down, making cheering noises from the crowd. “You’re such a tough guy,” she said while mussing his hair. “Rough day though, huh? Would some ice-cream make it better?”</em></p>
</div>
<p class="indent-para1">Zeke’s mother could easily be interpreted as very loving and caring by anyone who was watching. After all, she wants Zeke to feel better, right? Parents like Zeke’s mom are often seen as “the cool parent” by their children’s friends. If Zeke’s friends had seen his mother react to problems this way, they’d probably envy him. They’d probably see their own parents as strict and boring in comparison. But even though she may be loving and caring, she has failed her child. She’s treating Zeke as a buddy, a pal, not like a child who needs rules to live by and help managing his impulses. A loving, caring parent who is able to do the real work of parenting would not give her child the message that the trouble he had at school isn’t important or that there’s nothing to be learned from his mistakes. Zeke’s mother traded the opportunity to teach him some valuable lessons for the opportunity to be his pal.</p>
<p class="indent-para1"><a id="page_30" class="calibre3"></a>The reality is that not all permissive parents are parenting this way out of selfishness, as were Audrey’s parents. Many permissive parents, like Zeke’s mother, love their children very much and have the best of intentions. Often they are simply parenting their children as they themselves were parented. They don’t realize that they must be in the role of authority with their child, via limits, consequences, and saying “no,” in order to help their child know himself and understand relationships and feelings.</p>
<h4 class="h"><a id="chapter02section04" class="calibre1"></a>Type 4: The Bereaved Parent: Divorced or Widowed</h4>
<p class="para">Bereaved parents are often just desperately trying to cope. It’s not easy to have a parent who is grieving. It’s even harder when they are grieving your other parent, whom <em class="calibre6">you</em> lost <em class="calibre6">too.</em> Children who lose a parent through divorce or death have their own grieving to do. Grief in a family can be very complicated and difficult. But in this book, we are interested mainly in just one aspect of this situation: when it results in Emotional Neglect of the child.</p>
<p class="center-paral">SALLY</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">Sally is the middle of 5 children in a loving Irish family. Every day, Sally’s family is busy with church activities, Little League, PTA, neighbors, school, cookouts and piano lessons. The children fight a lot because they’re all close in age, but mostly they get along and love each other. Sally’s mom is a very busy lady trying to keep up with the children’s school and sports while also working part-time at the town Recreation Department. Sally’s mom often tells her friends that she’s glad to have her part-time job, as it’s the only non-mom-related thing in her life, and without it she would lose her mind. Sally’s dad is an engineer. He makes a good living, and life hurries along with little financial concern.</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><a id="page_31" class="calibre3"></a><em class="calibre6">Sally’s mother and father have very different temperaments. Her mom tends to be often overwhelmed, distracted and exhausted with the demands of her children. Her father is not home a lot because he works hard and has a commute, but when he is home, he enjoys his children. As middle children sometimes do, Sally tends to get somewhat overlooked in the family. She’s not the oldest or the youngest or the only girl or the most talented. But she has a secret feeling that she is her father’s favorite daughter. When they were having their family picture taken, he asked Sally to sit on his lap. Sometimes on Sunday mornings, she gets to sit next to him, and they read the comics together</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">When Sally was eight years old, she heard her parents talking in hushed whispers. She tried to listen but could only make out a few words. One word she did hear was “cancer.” Sally didn’t want to think about that, so she ran off to play. Gradually over the next few months she noticed her father losing weight. Six months later, he stopped working and stayed in bed all day. The day he didn’t go to work, the parents had a family meeting and told the children that their father had cancer. “But everything will be OK,” they said. “We don’t want you kids to worry about this.”</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">Three months later Sally came home from school, threw her books on the kitchen table and went to the fridge for a glass of milk. Her older sister came into the room with a tear-streaked face and said, “Daddy’s gone. They took him away.” Over the course of the next several months, the full gravity of that statement would hit Sally. She saw her mother very little for the first week after her father disappeared, and when she did see her, her face was still, as if carved from stone. Sally’s mother spoke little, and did not mention Sally’s father or the loss of him. She did not talk directly about it to any of her children. She let the helpful neighbors, aunts and <a id="page_32" class="calibre3"></a>uncles care for the children, with instructions to try to keep their lives as normal as possible. So Sally was driven to her piano lesson and taken to watch her brother’s baseball game. The only day they were held back from school was the day of the funeral. On that day, the children were dressed up, driven to the church for the funeral and driven home. Still, no one spoke about her father’s death. Sally was afraid to say anything to her mother or ask any questions because she had the feeling that any wrong question could make her mother’s stone face crumble. Sally didn’t want to hurt her mother.</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">After the funeral, life went on. It went on as if nothing at all had happened. No one mentioned Sally’s father. It was if he had never existed. But the family’s life changed drastically. Sally’s mother had to get a full-time job working in a cafeteria. They sold their house and moved into a much smaller rented apartment with no yard. Sally’s mother was gone 9 hours a day at her job. When she was home, she was almost always doing chores, and often with that stone face on. Sally learned to steer clear of her mother, because any need she had seemed to push her mother close to the edge. Sally lived in fear of seeing her mother fall apart.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="indent-para1">When I first met Sally at the age of 40, she was single, never married. She was a successful biotech engineer with a house of her own, a dog and a passion for Sudoku puzzles. But Sally came to therapy because she wasn’t happy. “I haven’t been happy since I was eight years old,” she said. Although she functioned just fine and had made a place for herself in the world, for 32 years she had struggled with a sadness that she couldn’t shake and an empty feeling that she couldn’t escape. Sally once told me, “Other people live in a different world from me. They see colors, feel things, love each other and get excited. I have none of that. To me, the world is gray. I’m on the outside, looking in.”</p>
<p class="indent-para1"><a id="page_33" class="calibre3"></a>Sally was right. She really was living in a gray world. She was running on a half-empty tank of low-octane fuel that had been diluted by a pool of unshed tears. Here are some of the feelings that Sally had been holding inside all those years:</p>
<ul class="calibre13">
<li class="calibre12">shock over her father’s sudden disappearance from her life</li>
<li class="calibre12">grief over the loss of him</li>
<li class="calibre12">anger that she hadn’t been told that her father was going to die</li>
<li class="calibre12">fear of talking about anything feeling-related because it might hurt another person (this message she had taken from her mom’s stone face)</li>
<li class="calibre12">loss of the feeling of being “special,” as she never again felt like she was anyone’s favorite</li>
<li class="calibre12">fear of becoming attached again since, from her experience, attachment is disastrously painful</li>
<li class="calibre12">anger at her family and herself for pretending that her father had never existed after his death</li>
<li class="calibre12">guilt that she had sometimes wished, periodically throughout her life, that it had been her mother, instead of her father, who had died.</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent-para1">It’s important to note here that Sally’s mother was a good woman. She worked hard and did her best, despite being overwhelmed. When she learned of her husband’s illness and that he was going to die and eventually lost him, she did not have the tools to manage her own grief herself, much less to communicate about it with her children. She went into Survival Mode, and coped with the “head down, nose to the grindstone” technique. She did the best she could possibly do with the tools she had available to her. Part of Sally’s work was to try to understand why and how it had all unfolded this way, how it had affected her, and all of the intense feelings she had internalized and buried as a result.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">In our work together Sally was eventually able to uncover each and every one of those feelings. She spent many hours in my office shedding <a id="page_34" class="calibre3"></a>the tears that she had been holding outside of her awareness all these years. Sally was able, through a lot of hard work, to start to tune in to herself, feel alive, and see the world’s colors as others do.</p>
<p class="center-paral">ZEKE</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">Zeke comes home from school feeling nervous that he has to show his father the note. He wishes he could hand it to his mother, but this is Thursday, and he always spends Thursday nights with his dad since his parents got divorced. Zeke knows his dad will not take this well because his Dad has been tired, irritable and short-tempered since Zeke’s mom moved out. Zeke doesn’t understand why his dad has to be this way. His mom and new stepfather seem really happy, and it pains him to see that his dad is not happy too.</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">Zeke hands his father the note. He watches nervously as his father slowly shakes his head from side to side. “This is your mother’s fault,” he says. “I’m not surprised that you’re starting to get into trouble after all that she’s put us through. Don’t worry, I’ll definitely talk to her about this.”</em></p>
</div>
<p class="indent-para1">You might imagine that Zeke would be confused by his father’s reaction. Zeke’s own impulses and feisty nature are completely overlooked by his dad, who chooses to see the situation as ammunition to use against his ex-wife, who left him precipitously and remarried quickly. Zeke may be relieved that he’s off the hook, but deep down he feels overlooked. His dad attempts to seem like he’s being protective of Zeke, but in reality he’s advancing his own agenda. Sadly, Zeke has no opportunity to learn anything from his mistake.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">It’s certainly understandable for a man to feel angry and hurt when he’s suddenly left by his wife. It’s also understandable for him to worry that this might damage the child they have together. When Zeke looks back on this scenario from the vantage point of adulthood, he’ll remember clearly how his dad was protective and didn’t get angry with him for <a id="page_35" class="calibre3"></a>getting in trouble. What Zeke <em class="calibre6">won’t remember</em> is what <em class="calibre6">didn’t happen.</em> And what didn’t happen was all of the things the mother did in my example of emotionally attuned parenting. You may recall that it involves knowing the child’s feelings, talking with the child, setting limits and giving the child a rule to live by. If Zeke’s dad continues to ignore his feelings and needs in this way, Zeke will most likely grow up to feel that his dad doesn’t really know him as a person at all. But he won’t understand the reasons for that because he can’t remember what didn’t happen. Probably he will blame himself.</p>
<h4 class="h"><a id="chapter02section05" class="calibre1"></a>Type 5: The Addicted Parent</h4>
<p class="para">When we hear the word “addict,” most of us think “alcoholic” or “drug addict.” But addiction encompasses a much broader range of compulsive behaviors, from gambling, shopping, and internet or porn addictions to scratch tickets, cigarettes, slot machines, and online gaming, to name a few. Some of these activities, pursued in moderation, are pleasant stress relievers. But these pursuits can cross the line into addiction when a person begins to:</p>
<ul class="calibre13">
<li class="calibre12">feel intense pleasure–bordering on relief when doing the activity or anticipating doing it</li>
<li class="calibre12">spend more and more time on the activity, so that family members notice or complain</li>
<li class="calibre12">spend money and other resources on the activity, whether or not one can afford it</li>
<li class="calibre12">use the activity for many purposes: to relieve stress, socialize, play, manage emotions or entertain others</li>
<li class="calibre12">deny that the activity is harming oneself or anyone else</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent-para1">In an unprecedented boom of high-tech toys, credit purchases, unlimited web access, and social networking, there’s plenty of potential for any of us to develop an addiction. Americans, in particular, are used to high stress and immediate gratification, both of which feed addictions. <a id="page_36" class="calibre3"></a>Most recently, neuroscientist David Linden wrote about the range of pleasures that our brains may become addicted to. He urges the reader to view addicts compassionately, the way you would any other ill person. But what makes that difficult for family members is the harm that the addict invariably causes the people closest to him.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">Addicted parents are not all the same. At one end of the spectrum there is a father or mother who is lost to drugs or alcohol and experiences obvious consequences. Children of these dysfunctional addicted parents are not only emotionally neglected, but traumatized. This is not the parent we’re discussing here. We’re interested in the functional, loving parent whose addiction may not even be identified as a problem in the family. These are the parents about whom my clients say some variation of “He had his beers every night, but it wasn’t a problem.” These are the parents who are forgiven for the wine every night, even if they get irritable or mushy, because they are there for their children in many ways. Functional addicted parents are capable of being good parents. They are there at the football game with the cooler and the snacks for the team. They invite over your cousins and aunts and uncles and have barbecues. When you get in trouble at school, they can march into the principal’s office and stick up for you. They can make you laugh.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">So what can a loving soccer mom who likes her wine possibly have done or not done to wind up in this book? Or a hardworking father who likes to bet on every sport on television? Are they guilty of emotionally neglectful parenting? Simply put, what harms children of functional, addicted parents is this: they are behaving like two people. And the child cannot always predict which side of her addicted parent is going to show up. When caught up in their addicted behavior, they forget to parent. They are temporarily asleep on the job, and so can be mean, frightening, immature, selfish or inappropriate. When not caught up in the behavior, the same parent can be kind, supportive, wise, helpful, fun or reassuring. So for the child of a functionally addicted parent, memories of family life are invariably mixed, with positive memories interspersed with sad ones. After a childhood chock full of unpredictable parenting, the adult child of the addict is anxious, worried and secretly insecure.</p>
<p class="center-paral"><a id="page_37" class="calibre3"></a>RICHARD</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">Richard comes to therapy at age 27 after experiencing a few panic attacks at work. He hadn’t known what they were, and ended up in the ER twice thinking he was having a heart attack. His father is a highly respected fire chief. When asked, Richard tells me that he had been a star baseball player as a teen. In his junior year of high school he was even nominated for MVP of the year. Richard also proudly tells me that his father came to every single one of his games. He remembers that his dad often pitched so that he could have batting practice. So far, so good, right?</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">Later in my session with Richard, I ask, “Was there ever a time you can remember growing up when you felt very, very anxious, similar to what you’ve been experiencing lately?” Here is what he tells me: “It was the awards banquet at the end of the baseball season, junior year. It was at 8pm and I had a little concern because Dad usually had had a few beers by then. When my name wasn’t called as the season’s MVP, and my teammate got it, my dad just stood up and said in his booming fire chief voice, “That damn kid doesn’t deserve it. My son made All-State!” Everyone stopped in shock, looking from me to my dad and back to me again. I was mortified. I just stumbled out of there, went outside and threw up. I don’t like to think about that memory. By the spring of the next season, I was partying too much to play baseball.”</em></p>
</div>
<p class="indent-para1">Children of addicted parents experience the lack of predictability as highly anxiety-provoking. As adults, they are therefore at significantly higher risk to have anxiety disorders and to become addicts themselves than are people who were raised by non-addicted parents. Being a good parent most of the time and a horrible parent once in awhile creates insecure, anxious adults who are just waiting for things to go wrong.</p>
<p class="indent-para1"><a id="page_38" class="calibre3"></a>Another aspect of addicted parenting that amounts to Emotional Neglect is the addicted parent’s tendency to balance his periods of neglect with periods of control and intrusiveness:</p>
<p class="center-paral">ELSIE</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">Elsie is a dark-eyed, insightful 12-year-old brought to therapy by her mother. Her mother, Catherine, is addicted to being thin and also abuses alcohol. She complains to the therapist about Elsie, saying that her grades have gone down and that she has become disrespectful and “mopey.” She calls Elsie an “overly-dramatic princess.” Elsie’s father travels a lot on business, and it is mostly Elsie, her mom and her younger sister at home. When her mother leaves Elsie and me alone in my office for our first appointment, Elsie tells me that she loves her mother, but that she wouldn’t “pick someone like her for a friend, because she can be mean.” She says that the minute she puts her hand on the front doorknob of her house after school she gets a worried feeling. If her mother hasn’t yet poured a glass of wine, things are fine. But if she has, she usually gives Elsie the evil eye when Elsie goes to get a snack or gets on Elsie to go out and exercise (even though Elsie is thin). Sometimes, says Elsie, it helps to have a mom who watches what she eats. But even though her mom tells her that she isn’t fat, Elsie believes that when her mom says “That crap you’re eating is fattening,” or “That’s enough,” or “Go ride your bike, you lazy girl,” or “Those pants look tight,” she means that Elsie doesn’t measure up. When she isn’t drinking, however, Elsie’s mom would not say anything like that.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="indent-para1">When parents are caught up in their own addictions, they aren’t capable of noticing their child’s emotions; nor can they relate to their child as he or she really is. When Elsie’s mom, under the influence of alcohol, would tell Elsie “Go ride your bike, you lazy girl,” for example, she was <a id="page_39" class="calibre3"></a>not truly talking about Elsie. She was actually expressing her own feelings about herself (her fear of being fat). When not under the influence, she was able to see Elsie realistically and tell her so. But after a glass of wine, everything was different. This is a perfect example of Emotional Neglect in action. Elsie is treated as a non-person, simply a reflection of how her mother sees herself. Unfortunately, being a child, Elsie had no idea that this was happening. She took her mother’s comments to heart, and by the time I met her, she had low self-esteem and a longstanding feeling of not being good enough.</p>
<p class="center-paral">ZEKE</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">Zeke gets off the school bus feeling anxious. He wonders what he can do to kill some time before he has to go home and give his mother the note from his teacher. He knows that if he can just get home a little later, his mom might be already absorbed in her computer game and not give the note much attention. Zeke’s not afraid of his mother’s reaction. But he’s a bright child, and has figured out over time that he can sometimes get away with things when his mom’s absorbed with the computer. So Zeke walks around the block, stops by his friend Scott’s house, and takes some time looking for cool rocks in the neighbor’s driveway. After a while, he realizes if he doesn’t get home soon his mom might get worried, so he gathers up all of his courage and walks in the front door.</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">Zeke notices immediately, with a sigh of relief, that his mother doesn’t look up at him when he arrives. “How was school?” she calls to him. “OK. I brought you a note from my teacher,” Zeke replies. Zeke briskly plants the note on his mom’s computer desk and runs into the kitchen to look for cookies. He knows his mom won’t stop her game to look at it, and by the time she’s finished she may have forgotten it’s there. With a sigh of relief at the success of his Operation Put Off Getting Into <a id="page_40" class="calibre3"></a>Trouble As Long As Possible, he hopes that she wins her games today so she’ll be in a good mood and won’t be upset even if she does end up seeing the note.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="indent-para1">It’s important to take note that Zeke is not really worried that his mother will overreact or become angry or abusive. His mother is actually kind, reasonable and loving. The issue here is that his mother’s computer addiction opens a window for him. He has quickly and easily learned how to use that window to avoid things, including the consequences of his own behavior. If he’s able to use it on something as serious as a note from his teacher, we can probably safely assume that he’s used it in many smaller situations.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">Zeke has been emotionally neglected here in that his issue at school may fall between the cracks due to his mother’s addiction. If he is successful in his Operation, he will not be called to explain himself, he will not get the feeling of being understood. He will not learn how to recognize or put words to his own emotions. In contrast, the things he will learn from his addicted mother are how to avoid consequences and how to “play” people. Interestingly, as an adult Zeke will probably not recall this incident of the note from his teacher at all. If he does, it’s very likely that he will blame himself for being manipulative, but not his mother for emotionally neglecting him. He’ll recall what he himself <em class="calibre6">did</em>, not what his mother <em class="calibre6">didn’t do</em>.</p>
<h4 class="h"><a id="chapter02section06" class="calibre1"></a>Type 6: The Depressed Parent</h4>
<p class="para">Let’s revisit third-grader Zeke, who we just left above, but he will have a depressed parent this time:</p>
<p class="center-paral">ZEKE</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">On his way home on the bus, Zeke feels terrible that he got into trouble at school. He knows that his dad is probably home on the couch where he’s spent a lot of time since he lost his job. <a id="page_41" class="calibre3"></a>When Zeke walks through the door, he sees that he was right. His father is lying on the couch with his eyes closed, with ESPN Sport Center providing a lively backdrop. Zeke greets his dad and hands him the note. He adores his father and doesn’t understand why he doesn’t do anything anymore. His father reads the note and a look of pain crosses his face. His dad sighs. “Don’t do it again, okay, Zeke? That’s no way to behave.” Zeke is flooded with shame, realizing that it is HIS poor behavior that makes dad sad. “I won’t, Dad,” he mumbles. He stands there for a moment longer, but his dad closes his eyes and appears to go back to his nap. Zeke quietly retreats.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="indent-para1">If his depressed father doesn’t get some help, the outlook for Zeke isn’t good. He will grow up feeling that he must be a perfectly behaved child so as not to make his dad feel worse. This pattern may become entrenched in his personality, so that he has great difficulty rocking the boat, making mistakes or allowing himself to be an imperfect human being.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">The depressed parent has little energy or enthusiasm for the job of parenting. Unlike the narcissistic parent who demands attention, the depressed parent often seems to disappear. He is turned inward, focused on himself and what’s wrong with him, worried about whether he’s going to make it. He has low energy and little to give. He is missing in action in the lives of his family. And when he <em class="calibre6">is</em> present, he may be irritable or glum. In the face of this, children who are growing up with depressed parents don’t know how to get attention from adults in positive ways. Good behavior goes unnoticed, while misbehavior commands at least some attention, however negative it may be.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">The results of this type of Emotional Neglect are well documented. In school, children of depressed parents are more likely to be perceived as troublemakers than children of non-depressed parents. Because the depressed parent offers little comfort or encouragement, his child doesn’t know how to self-soothe and may turn to drugs or alcohol in <a id="page_42" class="calibre3"></a>adolescence. Because depressed parents appear put-upon, beleaguered or overwhelmed by the ordinary demands of parenting, their children don’t always learn that they are worthwhile and so are at risk to become depressed themselves in adulthood. Finally, because depressed parents have inadequate control over their own behavior, their children are at risk to be out of control themselves.</p>
<p class="center-paral">MARGO</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">Margo thinks she’s a real badass. At 16, she was kicked out of her public high school for drinking in the girl’s bathroom and procuring weed for her softball team. She is being tutored at home. She has told her parents that she has absolutely no intention of stopping partying. When her parents make halfhearted attempts to set limits, she usually walks out the door and goes to a friend’s house. Margo tells her friends’ mothers all about how awful her own parents are to her, so they are sympathetic to her. Unfortunately, Margo’s parents are too apathetic to follow up with other parents, so Margo’s description of their alleged atrocities stands. At home, Margo stays in her room and video chats with men on Skype. She shocks her friends by telling them about her daring video sexting episodes.</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">Margo’s parents, Elaine and Bruce, are good people. They give to charity, belong to a church, and are kind and respectful to all. But each of Margo’s parents is depressed in a different way. They are a little older than her friends’ parents, having adopted Margo after years of futile fertility treatments. They have lots of money, thanks to a substantial amount of early Microsoft stock. But Elaine hadn’t ever gotten over the 14 years spent trying to become pregnant. Margo frequently finds her mother on the couch when she comes home, sometimes still in pajamas. This enrages Margo, and at such times she is contemptuous and provocative toward her mom. Her dad is not much more involved with Margo. He feels empty and without <a id="page_43" class="calibre3"></a>purpose since he stopped working. He goes to the library and takes courses to pass the time. Margo can remember fun times with him when she was little, but he has become more remote since his wife has gotten more depressed. Often, he brings home take-out since Elaine doesn’t cook much. But then he just sits beside Margo’s mother in his recliner, watching TV and nodding off.</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">Starting around 8<sup class="calibre14">th</sup> grade, Margo used to think a lot about how sad and regretful her parents would be at her funeral if she died. Imagining her parents and friends grieving helped in some way when she was sad. These thoughts became so frequent that she started thinking about killing herself for real. When she overdosed and ended up in the ER and then a psych hospital, her parents seemed to wake up and pay attention to her. Lately, they tell her they love her and ask her if she feels safe at bedtime, like the psychologist has told them to do. They are worried about her and question her every time she stays in her room too long. As far as Margo is concerned, finally getting some attention paid to her is great! But Margo is afraid if she gets</em> too <em class="calibre6">happy, they’ll stop worrying and go back to being the way they were before. She thinks she sees it happening already.</em></p>

<p class="indent-para1">You might be glad to know that Margo’s parents did not, in fact, go back to being emotionally distant and depressed. They all got help, and healing for Margo is underway.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">Not all households with depressed parents are as extreme as Zeke’s or Margo’s. But when the depressed parent’s toxic mix of inattention and distance continues for any length of time, the result is Emotional Neglect of the developing child.</p>
<h4 class="h"><a id="chapter02section07" class="calibre1"></a>Type 7: The Workaholic Parent</h4>
<p class="para">Workaholism is often seen as a positive in our society. The TV show 30 Rock portrays the workaholic quite well in the character of super ambitious businessman Jack Donaghy (played by Alec Baldwin). In one funny scene, lying in his hospital bed after barely surviving a work-stress-induced heart attack, he says with great feeling, “Being so close to death has shown me that I’ve lived my life all wrong.” When Tina Fey’s character leans in close to better hear the wisdom he’s about to impart, he whispers weakly, “I should have worked <em class="calibre6">longer</em> hours, and put <em class="calibre6">more</em> into my job.”</p>
<p class="image1"><a id="page_44" class="calibre1"></a><img src="../Images/00006.jpeg" alt="Image" class="calibre10"/></p>
<p class="captionc"><em class="calibre6">“Just wait until your nanny gets here.”</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1">In our capitalist economy, we value hard work and high salaries. Of all the addictions mentioned above (for example alcohol, drugs, shopping or gambling), work is the only one that actually brings money <em class="calibre6">into</em> the household. Workaholics are often driven, successful people who are admired and looked up to by co-workers, family and community. Unfortunately, it’s their children who often suffer in silence. Workaholic parents work long hours, are obsessed by their jobs, and tend to pay inadequate attention to the needs and feelings of their children. To make <a id="page_45" class="calibre3"></a>matters worse, children of workaholics garner little sympathy from others, as they often have successful parents, plenty of money, and nice things. By putting their work first, workaholics convey the message to their children that their feelings and needs are of lesser importance (damaging their children’s self-worth). By failing to be an active part of their children’s accomplishments and triumphs, they inadvertently convey a message that those accomplishments don’t matter (damaging their children’s self-esteem). Some children act out in school or with alcohol and drugs to get their parents’ attention. Others grow up with inadequate self-worth, low self-esteem, and no understanding of how they got this way. Since they view themselves as privileged, not deprived, they blame themselves for their inner struggles. Low self-worth, low self-esteem, and self-blame quickly add up to depression.</p>
<p class="center-paral">SAM</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">When Sam first came to me for therapy at age 19, he was in his freshman year at a very expensive private college, and he was very depressed. He was failing out of college due to the great difficulty he was experiencing in getting himself out of bed in the morning. He often lost the battle, spending all day sleeping and missing his classes altogether. He was disgusted with himself and expressed it to me this way: “I’m pathetic. My parents have worked so hard to give me a better life than they had, and they’ve given me every advantage. Here I am throwing it all away, and I have no excuse for it.”</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">In order to understand what was going on with Sam, you must first understand his parents. Sam’s parents met in high school and married at age 19. They both came from uneducated, impoverished families. Although both were quite bright, neither had the opportunity to go to college due to their financial situations. From the moment they married, they knew they would have to work very hard to make a decent life for themselves and their children. Sam’s father worked his way <a id="page_46" class="calibre3"></a>up from construction worker to managing jobsites all over the country. Although this required him to travel frequently, his salary jumped far beyond anything he had ever imagined. In the meantime, Sam’s mother started out working the front desk at a chain hotel. She also worked her way up, eventually becoming Executive Assistant to the CEO of the company, and also commanding a very impressive salary. Unfortunately, part of her job was to jump when the CEO said jump. This meant frequent middle-of-the-night calls, meetings extending well into the late evening, and spur-of-the-moment business travel. The bigger Sam’s parents’ jobs became the more excited and invested in them his parents became. They were achieving far beyond their wildest dreams, and it hadn’t occurred to them that they could stop, or even cut back.</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">As his parents’ jobs grew over the years, Sam gradually lost his parents. Sam, his parents, and everyone else talked frequently about how lucky Sam was as they kept replacing their houses with bigger ones and buying nicer cars. When he was 9, his parents hired his first nanny. Everyone could see what Sam was gaining materially, but his gradual loss of his parents was invisible to everyone. Between the ages of 9 and 19, Sam went from a child with two loving, attentive parents to a college student who was raised by a nanny and was now expected to thrive at college.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="indent-para1">Everyone knows that if a child’s parent dies, the child will suffer with sadness, loss, and possibly depression. No one thinks about this being the case when a child loses a parent to success. Since Sam had no conscious awareness of his loss of his parents, he had no understanding of his sadness and symptoms of depression. He naturally assumed that he had brought it upon himself. That set him up for a lot of self-anger, self-blame and low self-worth as a teen, and later as an adult.</p>
<p class="center-paral"><a id="page_47" class="calibre3"></a>ZEKE</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">Zeke walked in the door of his beautiful, spacious home and handed the note to his father, who had stopped by to change clothes before going to an evening meeting. His mother was away traveling for business. His father peered over his reading glasses at Zeke with a disappointed look. “This is not good Zeke. I’m sorry I have to rush to my meeting right now, but I’m going to give this note to Trish (the nanny) and she’ll talk with you about it tonight.”</em></p>
</div>
<p class="indent-para1">You may be wondering what’s so bad about this scenario. After all Zeke has a beautiful home, an obviously caring but busy father, and a nanny who attends to him. But sadly, the reality is that even if the nanny is a wonderful and tuned-in caretaker who says all the right things as she interacts with Zeke, this will still constitute Emotional Neglect. Because Zeke’s dad passes the issue to the nanny he gives Zeke the message loud and clear that his dad’s job is more important than Zeke’s own life lessons. Later, Zeke will likely remember these things that <em class="calibre6">happened</em>: his father’s not-unkind reaction, his nanny’s talk with him, and perhaps even what he learned from it. He will not realize or remember that his father wasn’t able to take time away from his job to talk to him about the note himself, or of the “less-than” message he received from his father that day. Instead, he’ll very possibly be prone to low self-worth. He has the opportunity to process and understand events that <em class="calibre6">happened</em>, but he has no chance to process what he can’t remember <em class="calibre6">what didn’t happen.</em></p>
<h4 class="h"><a id="chapter02section08" class="calibre1"></a>Type 8: The Parent with a Special Needs Family Member</h4>
<p class="para">There is no category of parent who deserves to be in a book about Emotional Neglect LESS than the parent in a household where someone is ill or severely impaired. Yet here they are, through no fault of their <a id="page_48" class="calibre3"></a>own, because life has delivered a challenge which is often unmanageable. Listen in on the conversation that parents Tom and Patty are having with their daughter, Miranda, age 13, the youngest of 3 children.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">“<em class="calibre6">You are such a big help to us, Miranda” says her dad, Tom.</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">“You sure are!” adds Patty. “I know it’s been especially hard lately with Patrick back at Children’s Hospital having his new shunt put in. Your brother Steven does nothing but complain. But you! You’re my rock!”</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1">And here is what it sounds like in the Smith household, where 10 year-old Jack’s older brother suffers from behavioral and emotional problems associated with autism:</p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">“I know it’s frustrating that Todd takes your stuff,” Jack’s dad tells him. “I know it’s hard to listen to him freaking out so much lately since his meds were changed. I’m sorry our basketball game was interrupted, but your Mom needed my help with Todd. You deserve better. But you know Jack, for now we all just have to be good to each other and be patient. Todd can’t help his problems. Your Mom and I are doing the best we can. It’ll get better.”</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1">And finally, here’s what goes on in Zeke’s household:</p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">Zeke comes in through the kitchen and the screen door slams. He enters the house with dread, because he knows he’ll have to show his mom the note from his teacher. Zeke feels awful because here is another burden for his mother to have to deal with, when she’s already dealing with so much. Quickly, Zeke’s mother appears from another part of the house, her finger pressed to her lips. “Shhh, Zeke! Your father is asleep. He had a rough night last night.” At first, Zeke feels a giant wave of relief. He had hoped that his father would be asleep so that he’d only have to deal with his mother’s reaction to the note. But the relief is quickly replaced by shame. “My father is sick and all I care about is myself. I’m a bad person.”</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1">When a child grows up with a serious illness in the family, whether it’s that of a parent or of a sibling, the care-giving that would normally go toward the child is compromised. Tom, Jack and Zeke don’t have the freedom to be themselves. Notice that Zeke feels guilty for having normal events and feelings (having a note sent home and hoping to avoid trouble for it).</p>
<p class="indent-para1"><a id="page_49" class="calibre3"></a>Often, the caregiver parent is stretched thin herself and calls upon the well child–implicitly or explicitly–to selflessly help out. Life in a household with an ill child or parent is often in crisis mode. For example, while a parent makes frequent trips to the hospital, the emotionally neglected child heats a frozen dinner and eats alone in front of the TV. Or the child finds himself constantly catching bits of medical conversations he wasn’t supposed to hear and doesn’t understand. The child gets rides with someone else’s parents to soccer games. He gets used to his parents being irritated by him for little reason.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">Parents of ill households usually recognize that there is an impact on the healthy child. They may check in with him, attempt to discuss how he’s doing and offer what support they can. They are conscious of the amount of time spent on the ill family member, and even worry about it. So these parents seem like the last parents who would emotionally neglect their healthy children. But multiple studies have examined the perceptions of both the parents and the healthy child in a household where someone is ill. In these studies, the parents and the healthy child are asked to rate how the healthy child is doing. Results consistently show that parents see their healthy child as doing “okay,” while that same child perceives him or herself in a much more negative light. Conclusions? When parents are (or feel) powerless to change the bad things in their children’s lives, they tend to minimize the effects of those bad things. Not only do such parents subconsciously minimize their child’s distress, they also inadvertently burden him with a maturity of which he is not really capable. They often need and expect their healthy child to be as compassionate, as selfless and as patient as they themselves need to be.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">Sometimes, family illnesses impact an entire childhood. In such cases, the child is likely to develop quasi-adult behaviors that don’t fall apart until adolescence:</p>
<p class="center-paral"><a id="page_50" class="calibre3"></a>STUART</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">Stuart’s father and mother bring him to therapy because, they say, at age 15 he has become “so negative.” Initially, he is almost silent for several meetings, resenting that he has been forced to come here, and refusing to say much. I see immediately that Stuart’s parents are consumed by concern for Stuart’s older brother, Larry, who has a disease that makes him extremely vulnerable to infections. I see this because while attempting to take Stuart’s developmental history in the parent interview, Stuart’s parents keep drifting back to the subject of Larry, and are seemingly unaware of doing it. From that, I know that Stuart, like many siblings of ill children, has held in his negative emotions and his own needs for years.</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">It seems clear to me that Stuart has finally reached his breaking point. His facade is crumbling, and he can no longer be “okay.” The breakdown of Stuart’s stoic attitude is inevitable but mysterious to his parents. They wonder where their helpful, nice son has gone and they’ve brought him to therapy to “fix” his negative attitude.</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">After a few meetings alone with me, Stuart begins to talk. He explains to me that he doesn’t bring friends home because he feels guilty that he can have normal friendships while Larry cannot. And he’s also wary that his friends might not understand some of Larry’s quirky behaviors. And then he feels guilty for being embarrassed by his brother, whom he loves.</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">So here he is in my office, feeling guilty for causing his parents more problems, starved for attention, resentful that they can’t recognize his sorrow, and unable to put any of it into words. When, after a few meetings, Stuart has an incident at home in which he gets verbally angry with them, his parents tell me that therapy is “making Stuart worse.” I encourage Stuart to respond and he blurts out, “Everything is always about Larry. You even left my All-Star game early to pick up his <a id="page_51" class="calibre3"></a>medications!” His parents start to protest, saying they left just a few minutes early and that he’s being overly sensitive. At this point, I intervene firmly: “This is exactly the problem. Stuart isn’t really allowed to say how he feels. And when he does, you call him sensitive. Larry is not the only child who needs help. But your good intentions for helping Larry are interfering with your ability to parent Stuart. You’re making him feel guilty for having needs and feelings.”</em></p>
</div>
<p class="indent-para1">This difficult moment in my office was a turning point for Stuart. Luckily, these parents were ultimately able to understand how Larry’s illness had stunted Stuart’s social and emotional growth for quite some time, causing him to hold in guilt, anger and sadness. Although they brought Stuart to therapy in hopes that <em class="calibre6">he</em> would change, it turned out that <em class="calibre6">their</em> change was as dramatic as Stuart’s, if not more so.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">The reason they had failed to notice Stuart struggling was that he’d given them no trouble growing up. Stuart’s parents finally realized that that’s what they’d been expecting from him throughout his brother’s illness, no trouble. With this awareness, Stuart’s parents began to pay more attention to his needs and feelings. If they are able to continue that throughout Stuart’s adolescence, the effects of Emotional Neglect can be reversed, and Stuart can grow up to be happy and healthy.</p>
<h4 class="h"><a id="chapter02section09" class="calibre1"></a>Type 9: The Achievement/Perfection Focused Parent</h4>
<p class="para">The Achievement/Perfection Focused Parent seldom seems to be satisfied. If his child comes home with straight A’s, he will say, “Next time I’ll expect A+’s.” This parent has a few things in common with the Narcissistic Parent we talked about. In fact, many of his behaviors are similar. A lot of Narcissistic parents are perfection-focused because they want their child to reflect well on them. In other words, “If my child makes straight A’s, it makes me look really good.” This ‘mirror effect’ is some part of most Achievement/Perfection parents (we’ll call them AP parents for short), but it’s not always. AP parents can be motivated by a number of different factors.</p>
<p class="image1"><a id="page_52" class="calibre1"></a><img src="../Images/00007.jpeg" alt="Image" class="calibre10"/></p>
<p class="indent-para1">Not all AP parents are emotionally neglectful. Many parents of Olympic athletes, concert pianists and professional baseball players could be considered AP because they are driven and they support their child to be the best. But the difference between a non-neglectful AP parent and a neglectful one is this: support. A healthy AP parent is <em class="calibre6">supporting</em> her child to achieve what <em class="calibre6">the child</em> wants. An unhealthy AP parent is <em class="calibre6">pressuring</em> her child to achieve what <em class="calibre6">the parent</em> wants.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">Some AP parents pressure their children to achieve because they desperately want opportunities for their children that they themselves did not have. Many are acting out of their own feeling that they themselves must be perfect. Some are trying to live their own life through their child. Still other AP parents may be simply raising their child the way they themselves were raised because it’s what they know.</p>
<p class="indent-para1"><a id="page_53" class="calibre3"></a>When young Zeke hands the note to his AP mom, what do you think she would say?</p>
<p class="center-paral">ZEKE</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">“Zeke, how could you behave this way at school? Now Mrs. Rollo may change her mind about writing the recommendation letter to help with your application to the Superior Amazing Child School! We need to call Mrs. Rollo right now and smooth this over.”</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1">Or AP Mom #2:</p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">“Zeke, you know better than to balance a pencil on your finger point-side-up! Mrs. Rollo is right. If you poked yourself in the eye it could slow down your progress on the piano. How can you practice if you can’t see the music?!”</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1">Or AP Mom #3:</p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">“Zeke, I’m terribly disappointed in you. I’ve made so many sacrifices so that you can be at this expensive school. If Mrs. Rollo starts to see you as a problem child you may ruin everything I’ve done for you. You have to think about your future!”</em></p>
</div>
<p class="indent-para1">Notice that all three of these reactions seem to have Zeke’s best interests in mind. These AP mothers are clearly concerned about their child and want the best for him. The problem is that all three mothers are emotionally neglecting Zeke with their responses. None of these responses addresses Zeke’s need to learn to control his impulses. None addresses Zeke’s recent feelings of being treated like a baby by his siblings. None of these responses talks to Zeke about anything that matters to <em class="calibre6">him</em>. All of the responses address the parent’s needs, not Zeke’s. They address Zeke’s future, which he is too young to care about or even understand. They take away an opportunity for Zeke to learn something about himself, his nature, his feelings, and how to get along with authority figures. Over time, in order to take in the simplistic message, “Be good so that you <a id="page_54" class="calibre3"></a>can be successful,” Zeke will have to squelch many of his own needs and feelings. This may work fine in childhood, but he will enter adolescence and adulthood with something missing inside; self-knowledge, emotional awareness, and self-love.</p>
<p class="center-paral">TIM</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">Tim was literally dragged to couple’s therapy by his wife, Trish. In our first appointment, it was hard to get Tim to say much at all. The one thing he expressed when he did talk was that he was disappointed in himself and Trish. “We love each other, and that should be enough. But nothing’s ever enough for Trish,” he said. When I asked him to elaborate, he would only say, “I can’t see why she won’t just let things go. Why can’t she just be happy?”</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">If I had taken this at face value, I might have been thinking at that point that Trish must be somewhat difficult to get along with. But having worked with many couples, I could see that there was definitely a lot more to the story. As I asked Trish questions, she started to cry. Here’s what she told me about her reasons for bringing Tim to therapy.</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">“Tim says he’s happy in our marriage but he doesn’t seem happy. He comes home from work irritable. He’s a wonderful father, but sometimes he snaps at the kids when they behave any way other than perfect. He’s always down on himself. He’s a V.P. at his company at only forty years old, but he still feels inadequate because he thinks he should be CEO by now. When I try to talk to him, he shuts me down. I know he’s miserable and I want to help but I can’t. At this point, I love him but I can’t live this way anymore. Please help us so that we can stay together.”</em></p>
</div>
<p class="indent-para1">Let’s pause here for a moment and consider Tim. Already in the first fifteen minutes of our first session, I strongly suspected that he was <a id="page_55" class="calibre3"></a>emotionally neglected as a child. Here were the Emotional Neglect signs that I could see in him (when you read Chapter 3, you’ll learn much more about these signs):</p>
<ul class="calibre13">
<li class="calibre12">irritability</li>
<li class="calibre12">perfectionism, evidenced by his lack of tolerance for his kids’ mistakes</li>
<li class="calibre12">lack of emotional awareness, evidenced by “Why can’t she just be happy?”</li>
<li class="calibre12">counter-dependence, evidenced by feeling disappointed in himself for needing help and by his refusal to accept help from Trish</li>
<li class="calibre12">lack of compassion for himself, evidenced by Trish’s report that Tim feels inadequate for being VP instead of CEO.</li>
</ul>
<div class="side">
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">After half a dozen couple’s meetings, Tim was finally willing to have some individual sessions. In those meetings, I discovered that Tim’s parents, while loving, raised him with one primary goal: to be successful. His stresses, struggles, achievements and abilities in childhood were all seen through the lens of “the future” by his parents. Tim had learned well that his feelings, needs and experiences were not relevant to anything. All that mattered was, “what does this mean for your future?” Tim entered adulthood, married and had his own children with very little knowledge about himself, his emotions, or how to connect with people, including his wife.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="indent-para1">Fortunately, since Tim was able to open up and share all of this with me, we were able to address it. After a number of individual sessions, he was able to apply his newfound self-acceptance, compassion and tolerance to his marriage and children.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">When a child is treated by her AP parents as if her feelings and emotional needs don’t matter, a deeply personal part of herself is being denied. That part of her becomes like the elephant in the room. No one <a id="page_56" class="calibre3"></a>wants to see or hear from it, yet it’s the part of her which is most <em class="calibre6">her</em>. The only way that most of these children can adapt, get along and grow in the family is to participate in the denial, and pretend that their emotional self doesn’t exist. No wonder neglected children grow up with an empty space in their sense of themselves, their love for themselves, and their ability to emotionally connect to others.</p>
<h4 class="h"><a id="chapter02section10" class="calibre1"></a>Type 10: The Sociopathic Parent</h4>
<p class="para">This will likely be the most surprising Parent Type that I will talk about in this book. Even if you are 100% certain that this category doesn’t apply to you, I recommend that you read this section.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">Who comes to your mind when you hear the word “sociopath”? Hannibal Lecter? Tony Soprano? Mussolini? These are indeed iconic representations of the concept. But they are the most extreme, dramatic and obvious versions of sociopathy. The kind of sociopath we’re interested in is different. This sociopath quite possibly never breaks a law and has never been to jail, is far less obvious but far more commonplace. This sociopath might be your neighbor, your brother, your mother or your father. She or he can hide behind a perfect manicure, an excellent job, charity work or the PTA. Most people would not ever think of this person as a sociopath. In fact, she may have a charisma that draws people to her. She may be admired and appear selfless and kind to many. But deep down, she is not like the rest of us. Sometimes no one can see that something is wrong except the people who are closest to her. Often her children can feel it, but that doesn’t mean they understand it.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">There is one main feature that sets sociopaths apart from the rest of us. That one thing can be expressed in one word: conscience. Simply put, a sociopath feels no guilt. Because of this, he’s freed up to do virtually anything without having to pay any internal price for it. A sociopath can say or do anything she wants and not feel bad the next day, or ever. Along with a lack of guilt comes a profound lack of empathy. For the sociopath, other people’s feelings are meaningless because she has no ability to feel <a id="page_57" class="calibre3"></a>them. In fact, sociopaths don’t really feel anything the way the rest of us do. Their emotions operate under a very different system, which revolves around controlling others. If the sociopath succeeds in controlling you, he may actually feel some love for you. The flip side of that coin is that if he fails at controlling you, he will despise you. He uses underhanded means to get his way, and if that doesn’t work, he’ll bully. If that fails, he’ll retaliate by trying to hurt you.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">Having no conscience frees up the sociopath to use any underhanded means to get her way. She can be verbally ruthless. She can portray things falsely. She can twist others’ words to her own purposes. She can blame others when things go awry. It’s not necessary to own her mistakes because it’s much easier to blame someone else. The sociopath has discovered the value of playing “the victim,” and plays it like a virtuoso.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">According to Dr. Martha Stout, who wrote <em class="calibre6">The Sociopath Next Door</em>, the single most reliable indicator that you’re dealing with a sociopath is when a person appears to purposely hurt you and then proceeds normally as if they did nothing wrong, and as if you should not be hurt. If someone does that to you repeatedly, you should consider the possibility that you’re dealing with a sociopath.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">When the person is one of your parents, this realization can be incredibly painful, but also freeing and life-changing. Typically the children of sociopaths desperately try to make sense of their parents’ behavior. They can be very creative in trying to explain the unexplainable. Here are a few of the many excuses I’ve heard the adult children of sociopaths come up with to try to make sense of their parent’s hurtful, underhanded or ruthless behaviors:</p>
<p class="para">&#160;</p>
<p class="extractt">“He has anxiety”</p>
<p class="extractt">“She doesn’t really mean it”</p>
<p class="extractt">“Something’s wrong with her brain”</p>
<p class="extractt">“He just cares too much”</p>
<p class="extractt">“She can’t help it”</p>
<p class="extractb">“He had a difficult childhood”</p>
<p class="indent-para1"><a id="page_58" class="calibre3"></a>To better understand what these adult children are trying to explain away, let’s check in again with Zeke, right after he hands his sociopathic mother the note.</p>
<p class="center-paral">ZEKE</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">Zeke watches his mother read the note. As she does so, he sees her lips compress in a thin, hard line of displeasure.</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">“What?! How could you do this, Zeke? I’m so embarrassed that you would behave this way at school.”</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">Zeke’s eyes begin to brim with tears. “I” he starts to say.</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">His mother interrupts him. “Not a word from you. I don’t want you to speak or even look at me. Go to your room right now and write, “I will never get in trouble at school again” 50 times, and it had better be in cursive. And it had better be readable. I don’t want to see your face until you’re done, and that means no dinner for you.”</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">After spending four hours in his room, writing and crying and crying and writing, Zeke manages to write the sentence only 20 times, and none of them in cursive. He feels cold terror in his heart because he knows his mother will be enraged when she sees he printed. There’s no help for this, however, because he’s far from mastering cursive writing at his age, having only just been introduced to it at school. But he’s hungry and sad and feels desperately guilty that he’s angered his mother so. He draws a heart on the bottom of the paper for his mother, and gingerly ventures from his room to where his mom is watching TV. “Mom, I can only do 20. I promise I won’t get in trouble again. Can I pleeeease stop?” he says meekly. Zeke’s mother doesn’t take her eyes off the TV so she doesn’t see his mussed hair, exhaustion or tear-streaked face. “Get back in your room</em> now,” <em class="calibre6">she growls. Or I’ll give you something to really cry about. And for coming out of there before I said, you can write it ten extra times.” She <a id="page_59" class="calibre3"></a>stands menacingly and starts walking toward Zeke. Zeke knows it’s time to retreat. He runs to his room, falls on his bed and cries himself to sleep.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="indent-para1">Notice that in this interaction Zeke’s mother has exhibited an extreme lack of familiarity with her own child. She’s unaware of what he can and can’t do developmentally (whether or not he can write that much or in cursive) and of his feelings (empathy). She’s also shown an extreme and unhealthy need to wield power over him (control). Also, she’s shown cruelty and a willingness to hurt her son emotionally that borders on sadism (taking enjoyment in hurting others). While extreme and harsh punishments are a hallmark of sociopathy, not all sociopathic parents necessarily mete out extreme consequences. Some give no punishments and exercise their need to control in other ways, through the use of guilt or behind-the-scenes manipulation, for example. The common factor for all sociopathic parents is that to them, raising a child is much like everything else; it’s all about power and control.</p>
<p class="center-paral">WALLACE</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">Forty-seven-year-old Wallace came to therapy after the death of his elderly father. Not because he wanted help with grief, but because of his extreme burden of guilt in his relationship with his mother. Wallace lives two hours away from his parents, yet for the last two decades he’s visited them only once per year, or even less. When I explored this with him, it became clear that as long as he could remember, he’s felt guilty about this. He told me that he felt like a most uncaring and unappreciative son for not visiting his parents enough. Yet he reported that almost every time he visits them, he gets either depressed or physically ill. “It makes me not want to go there. Also, my wife really hates to visit. Probably because my mom dislikes her.”</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><a id="page_60" class="calibre3"></a><em class="calibre6">Wallace described his recently deceased father as a workaholic who was not around much or very involved in his life. He described his mother as a “difficult person.” When I asked Walter questions about this, he explained, “Nothing I can do has ever been enough for her. She resents my wife, and I think it’s mostly because she feels that my wife took my attention away from her.” Wallace explained that his mother feels that he is a selfish man for visiting so little, and she tells him so, directly or indirectly, every time they talk or see each other. Over the years she has expressed her disappointment in his lack of devotion to her via various means.</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">He told me one story which in a nutshell shows his mother’s sociopathic style:</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">One Christmas Wallace and his wife and kids decided to bite the bullet and succumb to his mother’s wishes. They hadn’t visited his parents for almost a year, and knew that they needed to put in an appearance at the Christmas dinner his mother was putting together. Wallace’s mother was delighted that he was coming, even making the sweet potato recipe that was his childhood favorite. The visit seemed to be going remarkably well until it was time to open gifts. As the grandchildren excitedly tore into the brightly wrapped packages to see what their grandparents had given them, Wallace’s heart sank. He realized that his mother had again expressed her disappointment in his lack of attentiveness to her. This time she had made her point by giving her other grandchildren expensive new iPods, and Wallace’s children cheap plastic toy cameras. Wallace’s children expressed polite thanks to their grandparents. But Walter could tell that they were mystified and hurt by the dramatic gap between their gifts and the gifts that their cousins received.</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">Later that day when he had an opportunity to speak privately with his kids, Wallace tried to explain to them the <a id="page_61" class="calibre3"></a>inequality of the gifts. He told them that their grandparents were elderly and didn’t realize how different the gifts were. But he felt that this was one incident that he couldn’t let go. He knew that he had to confront his mother about it He found her alone in the kitchen and asked her if the gifts were a way of trying to tell him something. “Is Christmas to you only about how expensive the gifts are Wallace? You’ve never cared about anything but money. Next year I’ll be sure to spend more on your children if that makes you happy.” Then she added, “I guess that’s what I should expect from someone too busy to visit his own parents.”</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">That evening at Christmas dinner Wallace’s mother acted as though nothing negative had happened. She behaved as if Christmas was merry, as if everything was fine, and appeared to expect Wallace to do the same.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="indent-para1">In this one story from his adult life, she has exhibited <em class="calibre6">all</em> of the traits of a sociopath. Trying to control him via underhanded means, viciously attacking him and then acting as if the attack hadn’t happened, painting herself as the victim (neglected mother), and blaming Wallace (selfish son). In addition, she was willing to hurt her grandchildren in order to hurt her son.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">As Wallace and I worked together over time he was able to see that the guilt he was taking on was misplaced. His mother (and, by not intervening, his father) had driven him away with these kinds of controlling, punishing behaviors throughout his childhood, adolescence and adulthood. He was getting depressed and sick during visits because he didn’t understand what was happening. He was swallowing his mother’s toxins because he had grown up with them and couldn’t see them for what they were, partially blaming himself instead. Recognizing his mother as a sociopath helped him understand that he needed to protect himself and his children in whatever way was necessary. He was then freed up to focus on that instead of on his misplaced guilt.</p>

<h4 class="h"><a id="chapter02section11" class="calibre1"></a>Type 11: Child as Parent</h4>
<p class="para">This type of parent actually allows, encourages or forces his child to behave as if he is a parent, not a child. Sometimes the child must parent himself, and sometimes he must parent his siblings too. In the most extreme examples a child can even be called upon to parent her own parent. In the large majority of these families there is some sort of extreme hardship which forces the child to suddenly become an adult. Some of the parenting types we’ve already talked about are good examples of families with such hardship. Take, for instance, the bereaved family, the family with an ill family member or the family in which there’s an addicted or depressed parent. Another example might be a family with financial difficulties such that both parents are forced to work long hours. In all of these there’s some reason why the real parent is not performing the parental functions so that the child has to step up and take them over.</p>
<p class="center-paral">ZEKE</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">Third-grader Zeke walks home with the note from his teacher in his pocket. He rushes along as fast as he can, because he knows that he has to get home before his five-year-old sister gets dropped off from kindergarten by the neighbor. She’s too young to be home alone, and his mother won’t be back from her job cashiering at the local Stop &amp; Shop until 8:00p.m. Zeke doesn’t give even a tiny bit of worry to his note. He knows that his mother won’t be upset because she knows how responsible he is. She relies on him, and trusts him to take care of his sister, make them both peanut butter sandwiches for dinner and get his sister into her pajamas before she gets home from work. She won’t yell or be worried.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="indent-para1"><a id="page_63" class="calibre3"></a>Here Zeke’s lack of concern about his mother’s reaction shows that he doesn’t see himself in the child role. He’s essentially playing an adult role with all of his responsibilities with his little sister. Also, those responsibilities give him a status in which he has more power and authority than he should have with his mother. In the absence of a parent/child boundary, Zeke stands to learn nothing from the incident at school. Zeke is essentially missing out on childhood, which puts him at risk for more rebellious behavior as an adolescent. But unless his circumstances change, he’ll very likely grow up to be an overly responsible adult who has difficulty knowing what he feels, what he wants, or that either matters. This is a set-up for the empty, disconnected feeling that many emotionally neglected adults experience.</p>
<p class="para">&#160;</p>
<p class="extract-indentt"><span class="underline"><strong class="calibre4">That said, it’s very important to take note of one key thing:</strong></span></p>
<p class="extract-indentb">Being in a family that’s compromised in some way–single parent, sick parent, sick sibling, or financial hardship, for example–is by no means a sentence for Emotional Neglect. Many, many parents who are coping with challenges such as these do manage to stay attuned to their child and provide him with the care and attention he will need in order to feel connected and “filled up” as an adult. In fact, spending a lot of time with your child is not even a requirement for preventing Emotional Neglect. You can be aware of your child’s feelings, help him understand himself, and stay in tune with his emotional needs without spending tremendous amounts of time with him. Time helps make it easier, but a lack of it can be overcome.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">To illustrate this important point, let’s revisit Sally.</p>
<p class="center-paral"><a id="page_64" class="calibre3"></a>SALLY</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">Remember Sally, whom we talked about in the Type 4 Bereaved Parent? Sally’s father died of cancer when she was young. This loss of her father had a profound effect on her personality and functioning as an adult. Remember that no one had told the children that their father was likely to die. Sally was told “Daddy’s gone” by her sister, not by her mother. After Sally’s father died, her mother seldom spoke of him again. The children were left home alone after that point to essentially care for and parent themselves because their mother had to work long hours in a menial job to support the family.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="indent-para1">Which aspects of this scenario do you think led to Sally’s feelings of emptiness and of living in a colorless world as an adult? The death of her father? Her mother’s long hours after the death? The financial hardship that followed?</p>
<p class="indent-para1">The answer is none of the above. All of those factors are things that <em class="calibre6">happened</em>. They’re events. Events themselves don’t cause Emotional Neglect. If Sally’s mom, in the thick of her own grief, had had the ability to be emotionally attuned to the needs of her children, things could have turned out very differently.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">The cause of Sally’s Emotional Neglect was not the loss of her father. Nor was it what <em class="calibre6">happened</em> after her father’s death. The cause was actually what <em class="calibre6">didn’t happen</em> before and after her father’s death. No communication from her parents about dad’s illness. No emotional preparation of the children for what was to come (dad’s protracted illness and death). No careful, gentle sharing of the news of the death. No attention from parents and other adult family members to the children’s confusion, shock and grief after the death. No allowing the children to talk and share their feelings in remembrance of their dad, or to make sense of their feelings and give each other emotional support.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">All of these factors are <em class="calibre6">the absence</em> of something. They’re the white space in the family picture, the background rather than the foreground. <a id="page_65" class="calibre3"></a>That’s why Sally would have so much difficulty, as an adult, seeing what was wrong with her and why.</p>
<h4 class="h"><a id="chapter02section12" class="calibre1"></a>Type 12: The Well-Meaning-but-Neglected-Themselves Parent</h4>
<p class="para">Even the most loving and well-meaning parents can be emotionally neglectful. As noted at the beginning of this chapter, the WMBNT parent type probably makes up the largest subset of emotionally neglectful parents. After reading about all of these different types of emotionally neglectful parents, you’re probably developing a sense of how a loving, caring parent can be emotionally neglectful. It is entirely possible for a parent who loves and wants the best for his child to emotionally neglect her. The truth is, to <em class="calibre6">love</em> your child is a very different thing from being <em class="calibre6">in tune</em> with your child. For healthy development, loving a child just isn’t enough. For a parent to be in tune with his child, he must be a person who is aware of and understands emotions in general. He must be observant so that he can see what his child can and can’t do as he develops. And he must be willing and able to put in the effort and energy required to truly know his child. A well-meaning parent who lacks in any one of these areas is at risk of emotionally failing his child.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">To get a better idea of how WMBNT parenting works and repeats itself, let’s revisit Zeke one last time.</p>
<p class="center-paral">ZEKE</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">Zeke walks home from school with the note from his teacher in his pocket. His Mother is in the living room watching Oprah. “Hi, Zeke, how was school?” she calls out from the other room. When he walks into the living room and nervously tries to hand her the note, she asks him to wait a minute until a commercial comes on. He stands for a moment with the note in his hand, and then retreats to his bedroom to play video games. He leaves the note on his bureau. The next day his mother finds the note when she goes <a id="page_66" class="calibre3"></a>to put some laundry in his drawer. As she reads the note, she is momentarily bothered. But she thinks to herself, “Wow, Mrs. Rollo sure overreacts to things.” and puts the note and the problem behind her.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="indent-para1">In this example, Zeke’s mom, although a loving mother, is not attending to the <em class="calibre6">feeling</em> level of life. She didn’t sense whatever Zeke might have been feeling about having to hand her a note from his teacher, such as anxiety or consternation. She does not see a reason to be concerned about his disrespect at school because she’s blind to the connection between behavior, feelings, and relationships (in this case the relationship between Zeke and Mrs. Rollo). She places no value on Mrs. Rollo’s feelings, considering them an “overreaction.” These are sure signs of a person who is not aware or in touch with the world of emotion, and who lives mostly on the surface of life.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">Many of the parents we’ve already talked about in this book could very possibly fall into this category in addition to their own type. Let’s go back and take a look at all of the parents we’ve already discussed who may potentially be WMBNT.</p>
<ul class="calibre13">
<li class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre4">Sophia, Joseph</strong> and <strong class="calibre4">Renee</strong>’s Authoritarian parents. Many authoritarian parents were raised by such parents themselves. They love their children, but authoritarian parenting is all they know.</li>
<li class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre4">Samantha’s</strong> and <strong class="calibre4">Eli’s</strong> Permissive parents had the misguided belief that it is loving to let their kids do as they wish.</li>
<li class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre4">Sally’s</strong> Grieving mother loved her children, and did the best she could to take care of them. She simply didn’t have the emotional skills to be in touch with their feelings or help them manage them. It’s likely that her parents didn’t teach her those skills.</li>
<li class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre4">Margo’s</strong> Depressed parents clearly loved her. They may not have realized what was missing in their parenting of Margo because they didn’t receive it from their own parents.</li>
<li class="calibre12"><a id="page_67" class="calibre3"></a><strong class="calibre4">Sam’s</strong> Workaholic parents wanted to provide the best for him. They mistakenly thought material wealth would result in a happy, well-adjusted child.</li>
<li class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre4">Tim’s</strong> Achievement/Perfection-Focused parents had raised him this way, and he was in turn raising his children this way.</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent-para1">None of these well-meaning people probably had any idea that they were not providing their children with the fuel that they would need for a happy, connected life. They were each simply recreating what they had experienced in their own childhoods.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">One of the unfortunate aspects of Emotional Neglect is that it’s self-propagating. Emotionally neglected children grow up with a blind spot about emotions, their own as well as those of others. When they become parents themselves, they’re unaware of the emotions of their own children, and they raise their children to have the same blind spot. And so on and so on and so on.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">There will be more examples given in this book of Well-Meaning-But-Neglected-Themselves parents. See if you can identify them as you read Part II.</p>
