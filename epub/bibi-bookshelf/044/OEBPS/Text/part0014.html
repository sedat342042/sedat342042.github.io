<h3 class="h3a">COGNITIVE SECRETS: THE SPECIAL PROBLEM OF SUICIDAL FEELINGS</h3>
</div>
<p class="para1">This chapter will talk about a subject that no one likes to talk about, and most people don’t even want to think about. If you have never considered suicide and don’t know anyone who has, feel free to skip this chapter. I promise it will not take away from your overall experience of reading this book, and you will not get anything less out of it.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">If you have ever been affected in any way by suicidal thoughts or actions of yourself or another person, then read on.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">The subject of suicide is both unpleasant and scary. For most of us, it’s unimaginable, unthinkable. Some people think of suicide as a selfish act. Others see it as an act of cowardice. Most of us spend our lives doing everything in our power to avoid death. It is very difficult to grasp what must motivate a person to bring death upon himself. It must require something very dramatic such as a serious negative <em class="calibre6">event</em>, right?</p>
<p class="indent-para1">Even though we tend to do everything in our power to avoid this subject, many people know someone who has considered, attempted or committed suicide. According to the National Institute of Mental health, in 2007 there were 34,598 suicides in the United States. That’s 95 suicides <a id="page_104" class="calibre3"></a>per day. Suicide was the seventh leading cause of death for males and the fifteenth leading cause of death for females in 2007. These statistics do not include the 1,045 suicide attempts that occur every day in the U.S. And they certainly do not include the untold numbers of people who quietly contemplate killing themselves over long periods of their lives.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">People kill themselves for an infinite number of different reasons. Sometimes it really is something very dramatic, as noted above; a response to an extreme negative event, like a public failure or humiliation. Other times it’s a person’s attempt to avoid the consequences of his actions; a prison sentence, for example. Still others kill themselves due to bipolar disorder or severe or chronic depression. Although always shocking and baffling to the community and to the loved ones left behind, it’s at least possible to have some clarity about <em class="calibre6">why</em> when there is some clear event or disease that can be identified as the catalyst. This is, however, not always the case.</p>
<p class="center-paral">ROBYN</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="indent-para1">32<em class="calibre6">-year-old Robyn lives in the heart of Seattle. She has a natural, downplayed attractiveness which makes people notice her. She has long auburn hair which she usually wears caught up in a barrette or a haphazard ponytail. When people first meet Robyn, they can’t help noticing the unusual combination of auburn hair and crystal blue eyes, and Robyn receives many comments on it. Most people feel they’re complimenting Robyn when they mention it, and are surprised when she looks embarrassed in response. Actually, Robyn is very uncomfortable with the fact that her appearance is noteworthy or unusual. Even at age 32, she tries to downplay her looks, as she is much more comfortable when she’s able to keep herself in the background.</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">Robyn is single, never married. She earned a B.S. in psychology at age 21, but after a couple of years working at various jobs, she decided that it wasn’t possible to make a living <a id="page_105" class="calibre3"></a>with it. At that point she went back to school and now has an M.B.A from UCLA. She has a great job which pays well and a nice condo in a lovely downtown neighborhood. She lives about a mile from her gym, and can often be seen running to and from the gym on weekends, taking care to get the right combination of aerobic and resistance training. Robyn’s friends love to tease her about her healthy habits. She’s a careful eater and has a phobia of eating grilled food, as she read somewhere that charred foods can cause stomach cancer. Friends good-naturedly have canned tuna on hand when they invite Robyn to a cook-out. Any extra trouble is made up for by the fun they have teasing her about her eccentric pet peeve, which Robyn takes well.</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">Robyn’s friends describe her as a contradiction. They feel they can tell her anything because she’s great at listening and giving advice, and can be counted on for solid, thoughtful feedback. But she seldom shares much about herself. She’s good at giving, but she doesn’t ask her friends for support or advice. On top of that, she can at times be impossible to track down. She can go weeks at a time not answering her phone. Her friends joke that “Robyn’s in hermit mode.” While she will accept invitations to social activities, she seldom initiates any. In fact, the majority of Robyn’s friends have never seen her condo. Her general demeanor is quiet and in the background, but if she has a few drinks, she is the life of the party. Her wry sense of humor emerges, and she becomes hilarious and even socially daring. Friends sense a depth in her, but sometimes feel frustrated that they cannot reach it. It’s as if Robyn is an excellent friend, but when she’s in “hermit mode,” she is completely inaccessible.</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">One Saturday night in June, Robyn went to her friend Trish’s house for a cookout. Trish had a new recipe for lemon martinis, and they were surprisingly delicious. While <a id="page_106" class="calibre3"></a>everyone else had grilled steak tips, Robyn had her requisite tuna sandwich, and 3 lemon martinis. As usual, she was ridiculously fun that night. They played poker until the wee hours of the morning, and finally decided they were done in for the night and went home.</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">Two days later, Trish received a phone call from Robyn’s sister with shocking news. Robyn had been found unconscious by her sister, who dropped by to visit and was alarmed that Robyn didn’t answer the door. Robyn had taken an overdose of pills on Sunday, the day after the cookout.</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">No one in Robyn’s circle of friends, family or coworkers could make sense of her self-destructive action. How could such a smart, successful, loved person do this? She had everything to live for. Why would she try to take her own life? Why were there no signs? Why didn’t somebody pick up on some indication that Robyn might be planning to kill herself? All of Robyn’s loved ones racked their brains trying to come up with a clue that they had missed. They found themselves analyzing every second of every minute of every moment they had spent with Robyn in the prior week. No one, including her friends at the cookout, could come up with a single thing.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="indent-para1">There are many, many suicides which seem unattributable to any event or illness. These are sometimes folks who appear to be at the top of their game: Harvard students, successful business people, high school athletes who are making straight A’s. Or it may simply be a friend, neighbor, colleague or sibling whom everyone thought was fine. Sometimes there is an identifiable trigger, but it does not seem significant enough to lead someone to kill him or herself. Often the person’s loved ones are left not only in shock, but also mystified and confused. Those left behind end up grappling with unanswerable questions, not only <em class="calibre6">how could they do this</em>, but <em class="calibre6">why did they do it</em>?</p>
<p class="indent-para1"><a id="page_107" class="calibre3"></a>To try to answer this question, let’s now go back to Robyn. So far, you have experienced her the same way that her friends and family have. From the outside. Now we will go to Robyn’s interior world, to understand, from the inside out, why she would take such an extreme action, and what really has been going on for her.</p>
<p class="center-paral">ROBYN</p>
<div class="side">
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">Robyn grew up in a small, peaceful town in Washington state. She was the third of five children of loving and attentive parents. Her father worked as a mechanical engineer, and her mother stayed home with the children until they all entered their teens, at which point she went back to work, as a teacher’s aide in their local school system.</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">In many ways Robyn’s childhood was fine. She and her siblings were all close in age. They lived in a tree-lined neighborhood loaded with families and children, so Robyn was never lacking for a playmate. She was close with her sisters. Her family, while by no means wealthy, had plenty of money for a good life, so there was no financial stress, and they never had to go without. Every April they packed up and flew to Disney World for a week, and every December they spent the week of Christmas and New Year’s in Portland, Oregon with Robyn’s grandparents.</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">Robyn’s parents seldom argued, and they had very low tolerance for negativity of any kind. When a conflict would break out between the children, as they do with all siblings, the parents would crack down by sending all parties to their rooms immediately. It didn’t matter what the fight was about, or if one person was clearly in the right or being victimized. The parents’ motto was “Zero Tolerance.” They also applied this rule to complaining, or any expression of unhappiness, sadness or frustration. The result was a quiet household. The children <a id="page_108" class="calibre3"></a>learned early on that if they had something negative on their minds, they had better keep it to themselves. Mom and Dad refused to be burdened by such nonsense. They wanted this to be a happy, cooperative household where everyone got along and no one was dissatisfied. Also, with five children to manage, they felt they didn’t have the time and energy to put into solving crises, assuaging tears and soothing frustrations. The Zero Tolerance policy allowed them to stay in charge of the household, and, they felt, keep a positive outlook on life.</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">Robyn and her siblings were seldom in the house. From an early age, they far preferred running free in their neighborhood with their siblings and friends. Outside of the house, they were free to complain, fight, and express their thoughts and feelings, both positive and negative. Robyn’s siblings found this refreshing and freeing. They were able to figure out that the feelings that their parents wouldn’t tolerate were acceptable elsewhere. However, Robyn was different.</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">Robyn had been a sensitive child from birth. Her parents’ third baby, they noticed right away how her personality differed from her older siblings. She cried a lot. She fussed when her mother put socks on her or gave her a new, unfamiliar pacifier. Her parents nicknamed her “Frequent Crier,” a jokey take on the phrase “Frequent Flyer.” As she grew into toddlerhood and eventually kindergarten and school age, she received plenty of good-natured ribbing from her family members because she was so quick to tear up. Quiet tears tended to lead to silly ribbing. But vocal crying was another matter. If Robyn’s tears made noise, her parents enacted Zero Tolerance policy, and she was immediately sent to her room.</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">Throughout all of this, Robyn learned a powerful lesson. She learned that negative emotion was bad and would not be tolerated. She learned that any feelings she had that were not upbeat, fun or positive must be kept to herself and carefully <a id="page_109" class="calibre3"></a>hidden. She felt ashamed that she had such feelings, and silently vowed to never let them be seen. Over time she learned this lesson so well that she hid her negative emotion even from herself. She made sure to keep herself positive and upbeat at all times. When periodically she reached a point where she was unable to appear upbeat, she withdrew completely, holing herself up in her condo. She would then spend all of her time either at work, absorbed completely in her job duties, or locked in her condo voraciously watching television shows. This helped her keep all thoughts and feelings at bay until she could regain her energy to continue fighting off all negativity and be “happy” again.</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">Robyn didn’t just fight this battle. She lived it. Her life was organized around making sure that she did not reveal, see, know or feel anything negative from within herself. It took a tremendous amount of energy. She was so bent on hiding the shameful, negative part of herself (Robyn’s version of the Fatal Flaw) from the world that she couldn’t let anyone get to know her too well. This is why her friends were not invited to her condo. She was afraid that they might catch a glimpse of some part of her that she didn’t want to be seen.</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">It’s important to note that throughout all of this, Robyn was intensely lonely. She knew that her parents, family and friends loved her. But she didn’t feel loved. It’s hard to feel loved by people who don’t really know you, and nobody really knew Robyn. Not even Robyn. She felt completely isolated from the rest of humankind. Other people seemed happy and complete. They seemed to know each other, to care for each other, and to be free. Other people didn’t seem to hide parts of themselves or to have this struggle. Robyn felt that she was on the outside of life looking in, watching herself as if she were on a movie screen, disconnected, alone and utterly unknown. She often wondered about the point of being alive. If life is so <a id="page_110" class="calibre3"></a>empty, with so much suffering, pain and lack of reward, why live it?</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">Since adolescence, Robyn had had this “outside looking in” feeling. At age 13, she had started wondering what was wrong with her. She’d had a great childhood, so there was no explanation for how flawed she felt. There was something missing, something sick inside of her, a secret void. The only way she could soothe herself was to imagine being dead. Being dead would be such a relief. She did not have any intention to kill herself, but she reserved the possibility as a safety net. If she ever reached a point where she could no longer tolerate the pain, she could always end her life. Then there would be no more struggle, no more emptiness, no more loneliness, no more pain. Robyn used fantasies of being dead and her secret knowledge of her safety net as her chief method of soothing herself from age 13 all the way through her adulthood, but she had not breathed a word of it to a single soul.</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">Now let’s go back to the day after the barbecue, when Robyn acted on her safety net. Here’s what happened that day:</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><em class="calibre6">Robyn woke up with a moderate hangover and with memories of the excellent fun she’d had the night before. She poured herself some cereal and sat down in front of the TV. She felt a dark cloud hanging over her head, as she had been fighting off “hermit mode” for a couple of weeks. She felt exhausted, lethargic and empty, but above all, numb. She tried to make the numbness and emptiness go away by watching an old Andy Griffith episode. It didn’t work, so she lay down on her sofa and started to imagine being dead, since that usually helped. This time, it didn’t seem to work, and instead the emptiness and pain just got more intense. She stood up and paced from one end of her living room to the other, back and forth, back and forth. As she did so, the dark cloud got darker, the emptiness deeper. Some part <a id="page_111" class="calibre3"></a>of her preoccupied mind noted that The Waltons had come on after Andy Griffith on the TV. This made her flash back to a memory from childhood in which her family chided her relentlessly for crying over a Waltons episode. She suddenly felt intense shame and self-hatred pile on top of her emptiness. Desperate to stop the worsening pain, Robyn impulsively ran to her bathroom and swallowed every pill she could find in her medicine cabinet, many of which she had stored up just in case she ever got this desperate.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="indent-para1">As you can see, the Robyn that everyone else knew and loved was not the real Robyn. She was essentially a time bomb, set to explode periodically. What was different about this particular situation that caused Robyn to act on her fantasy? It was not a dramatic event. It was a TV show that brought her shame and self-blame into full force at the worst possible moment. Robyn was already at risk before the The Waltons show came on. But the family memory of criticism and humiliation was the final straw, plunging her even deeper into her own well of impossible aloneness and isolation. Ultimately, all it took was a Waltons re-run.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">Robyn was lucky that her sister stopped by. Many people like Robyn are not found until it’s too late. These are the people who don’t get help. They don’t get to share or understand their pain, and they don’t get to explain their final moments to anyone. These are often, I think, the people who leave their loved ones baffled and confused, never to understand what happened.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">Now let’s revisit some of the people we met in Chapter 3, who will help us look at this issue from some different angles. But first, let’s pause to consider the possible relationship between suicidal feelings and Emotional Neglect. Here I would like to remind you that human beings are designed to feel emotion. When that design is short-circuited, first by emotionally neglectful parents and later continued by the child himself as an adult, it throws off the whole system. Imagine ice-cream made without sugar, or a computer program in which some of the most basic <a id="page_112" class="calibre3"></a>commands have been removed. Such is the malfunction of the human psyche when emotions are pushed out of it.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">In many ways, emptiness or numbness is worse than pain. Many people have told me that they would far prefer feeling <em class="calibre6">anything</em> to <em class="calibre6">nothing</em>. It is very difficult to acknowledge, make sense of, or put into words something that is <em class="calibre6">absent</em>. If you do succeed in putting emptiness into words to try to explain it to another person, it’s very difficult for others to understand it. Emptiness seems like <em class="calibre6">nothing</em> to most people. And nothing is nothing, neither bad nor good. But in the case of a human being’s internal functioning, nothing is definitely something. Emptiness is actually a feeling in and of itself. And I have discovered that it is a feeling that can be very intense and powerful. In fact, it has the power to drive people to do extreme things to escape it.</p>
<p class="indent-para">Remember <strong class="calibre4">Simon</strong>, the handsome, successful 38-year-old who took up skydiving? You may recall that Simon had suicidal feelings because he felt so empty and numb. For him, life was devoid of connection, meaning and passion. The thrills of skydiving were short-lived, and were insufficient to give him a reason to want to live.</p>
<p class="indent-para1"><strong class="calibre4">David</strong>, on the other hand, had internalized the message “Don’t have feelings, don’t show feelings, don’t need anything from anyone, ever.” His suicidal feelings were based upon his wish to fulfill this mandate which he had unwittingly absorbed from his parents. Since David was indeed a living, breathing human being with both feelings and needs, the only way he knew to accomplish that mandate was to be dead. Indeed, by the time I met him he had already essentially stopped engaging in life.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">You may recall that <strong class="calibre4">Laura</strong> went through her life with her feelings completely cut off. She used beer and cutting to release them, but paid for it with intense shame. Laura lived in a prison of her own self-perceived flaws. She felt like damaged goods, unlovable and disconnected. Laura’s suicidal feelings stemmed from her anger at herself for having feelings and needs that she was unable to accept, acknowledge or abolish. In these ways, she was similar to <strong class="calibre4">Robyn.</strong></p>
<p class="indent-para1"><a id="page_113" class="calibre3"></a><strong class="calibre4">Cal</strong> had a plan to kill himself at the end of the millennium. The idea of dying in a big way was comforting to him, because he felt that people around him would finally be able to see the pain that he had been forever unable to communicate to them through words. When Cal was overcome by emotion, he used this grandiose escape fantasy to soothe himself.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">I believe these four emotionally neglected people were at high risk of acting upon their suicidal feelings. If they had not entered treatment in time, they each had the capacity for genuine self-harm. Here are some factors that all four plus Robyn had in common:</p>
<ul class="calibre13">
<li class="calibre12">emptiness and numbness</li>
<li class="calibre12">suffering in silence</li>
<li class="calibre12">questioning the meaning and value of his or her life. (what’s the point of living?)</li>
<li class="calibre12">escape fantasy</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent-para1">It’s important to note that David, Laura, Robyn and Cal all had loving, well-meaning parents. They all grew up in comfortable middle-class homes and were well cared for. None were abused, and they all had the trappings of a lovely childhood. For all of these people, there was really only one thing seriously wrong. And the thing that was wrong was invisible. It was something imperceptible, something <em class="calibre6">missing</em> that no one inside or outside of the family could see.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">For a person with Emotional Neglect, the numbness and suffering are held in secret. Like all of the other emotions, they are not shared with anyone else. Over time, you may be able to imagine the toll that this would take on any human being. Like floodwaters over a river basin, they gradually erode away the bedrock of a person’s existence: their energy, motivation, self-esteem, and engagement in life.</p>
