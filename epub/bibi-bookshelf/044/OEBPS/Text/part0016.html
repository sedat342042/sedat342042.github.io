<h3 class="h3a"><span class="line">HOW CHANGE HAPPENS</span></h3>
<p class="para1">Before we start the process of trying to correct what’s missing, it’s important to take a little time to consider change: how it happens and how it doesn’t, what gets in the way, and what to do if it doesn’t go as you would like (as it seldom does).</p>
<p class="indent-para1">You will see that in the next chapters, I’ve included a number of Change Sheets. They are intended for you to use in your attempts to fill the empty spaces and address the habits that may have developed out of your Emotional Neglect. These Change Sheets are in no way meant to imply that change is as one-dimensional as a sheet. My concern is that as you go through the chapter, you may feel them to be a cookie-cutter approach to the deeply held, complex, individual struggles with which you are faced.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">Taking a factory-created, one-size-fits-all approach is <em class="calibre6">not</em> my intention. Such an approach would be doing nothing more than furthering your Emotional Neglect, which is the last thing I wish to do. So as you read through the remaining chapters on <strong class="calibre4">Filling the Tank</strong>, please know that I intend for you to take a buffet approach. Choose the Practice Sheets, techniques and suggestions that apply <em class="calibre6">to you</em>, and tailor the Practice Sheets in ways that will be helpful <em class="calibre6">to you.</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1">In the meantime, let’s talk about some of the most powerful factors which can get in the way of successful change. Understanding them and <a id="page_118" class="calibre3"></a>keeping them in mind as you start to make changes will help you to see them quickly when they come up. It will also help you work through them if they start to hold you back.</p>
<h4 class="h"><a id="chapter05section01" class="calibre1"></a>Factors That Get in the Way of Successful Change</h4>
<h4 class="h4a">1. False Expectations</h4>
<ul class="calibre13">
<li class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre4">That change is linear:</strong> It is natural to expect that, once you start working to make a change, you should see success that gradually builds upon itself, getting better and better over time. Picture a staircase that you are climbing, taking one step at a time, with steady progress upward. Most real change does not work that way at all. Instead, it comes in fits and starts. Two steps forward, one step back. The real key is to just keep working through the backward steps, consistently and persistently, until you take another step forward.</li>
<li class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre4">That setbacks are failures:</strong> The danger of feeling like you’ve failed when you have a setback is that feelings of failure can easily turn into self-anger. And self-anger is the enemy of progress. It can easily send you off track or backward.</li>
<li class="calibre12"><strong class="calibre4">That if you get off track, you may as well give up:</strong> Getting off track is built in to the process of making a change. If you are trying to eat better, exercise, or change any longstanding behavior or habit, there’s a very high probability that more than once you will get off track. It is absolutely OK if it happens, and it’s immaterial to your ultimate success, as long as you don’t give up.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="h4a">2. Avoidance</h4>
<p class="para">Change is difficult on a lot of different levels. First, you have to make yourself do something that feels foreign; second, you have to be able to make yourself do something that you find difficult; third, you have to be <a id="page_119" class="calibre3"></a>persistent, as described above; and fourth, making a change requires a lot of work.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">A natural reaction to all four of the above challenges is avoidance. Isn’t it pretty tough to take on all of those? Wouldn’t it be more comfortable to simply put it out of your mind and not worry about taking on those battles? Of course it would! But, like self-anger, avoidance is the enemy of progress. Avoidance may beckon like an oasis in the desert, but it will leave you parched.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">The only way to deal with a natural pull toward avoidance is to face it head on. Take notice of those moments when your avoidance kicks in, then turn around and challenge it. Remind yourself that it will take you down a one-way street to nowhere. Remind yourself that all things worth having require effort. Then pull out your Change Sheet and start working.</p>
<h4 class="h4a">3. Discomfort</h4>
<p class="para">Change can be a very frightening thing. When you start to feel different from your old self, or when people start to react to you differently because of the changes you’ve made, it can feel like you’re living in an alien world. It’s hard to know how to behave and how you should react. Suddenly, things don’t feel as safe as they once did.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">In my experience, most people are unaware of their discomfort. But they feel it, and then they naturally want to retreat from their changes, and go back to where they were before. This is a completely natural feeling and a very normal response. But it’s just as dangerous as any of the factors we talked about above. It sends you back toward square one. For example, many people, after they’ve lost their first few pounds, suddenly feel different. Even if it feels better, it also feels strange, and that’s uncomfortable. So they lose muster and their efforts fade. Be aware of the strong possibility that this might happen for you. Watch for it. Recognize that it’s normal but destructive. Don’t let it take you down. Just keep going.</p>
