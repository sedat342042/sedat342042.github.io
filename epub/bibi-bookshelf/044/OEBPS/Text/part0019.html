<p class="captionc"><em class="calibre6">“I swore I wouldn’t make the same mistake with my children as my parents did with me.”</em></p>
<p class="para1"><a id="page_179" class="calibre3"></a>If you were emotionally neglected and are a parent or want to be one someday, it’s very important that you read this chapter carefully. The first thing we’ll address here is your own parental guilt. Second, together we’ll identify the areas in which your Emotional Neglect challenges appear, or may appear in your future as a parent. Finally, we’ll talk about what you can do to make sure that you will be an emotionally attuned parent who raises children who are emotionally aware and attuned to themselves and others.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">But before any of that, let’s start with the good news. Take heart that no matter what mistakes we’ve made as parents, they can be fixed. Children are incredibly resilient. As I’ve said before, children are like little sponges. They soak up whatever we give them. And the converse is also true; they don’t soak up what we don’t give them. So as soon as we change what we’re giving them, they’ll change, often after an adjustment period. Beyond that, any changes you make in yourself will trickle down to your children. The more you change yourself for the positive, the more your children will naturally change for the positive. This is true even for teenagers, although teens can be somewhat different because they’ll often do their best to hide those changes from you, their parents. Don’t be fooled. Your teen is changing too.</p>
<h4 class="h"><a id="chapter08section01" class="calibre1"></a>1. Your Parental Guilt</h4>
<p class="para">Here’s my first question for you: Has reading this book made you doubt or feel guilty about your parenting? Has it set off that self-blame and ruthless self-judgment that’s so typical of the emotionally neglected? If so, please absorb the principles below before you read on. As you continue through the chapter, be sure to return to these five principles and reread them as needed to address any guilt that may arise for you. This will require you to be emotionally attuned to yourself so that you’ll notice when you feel guilty. And emotionally caring for yourself so that you’ll take the time to come back and read them again.</p>
<ul class="calibre13">
<li class="calibre12"><a id="page_180" class="calibre3"></a>Many parents have some degree of guilt about their parenting at times. It often arises out of concern about whether you are doing the job right. But guilt is NOT NECESSARY for good parenting, and it can actually interfere with healthy parenting.</li>
<li class="calibre12">If you’re a guilt-prone parent, your guilt may be interfering with your ability to make good parenting decisions. It’s hard to say no when you feel guilty. It’s harder to set limits with your children. It can make you second-guess your every move. Children pick up on parental self-doubt and know how to take advantage of it. Therefore, guilt weakens you as a figure of authority.</li>
<li class="calibre12">While guilt may be a sign that you care, you will probably be a better parent without it. Instead of feeling guilty, the goal is to hold yourself accountable as a parent, but also understand that no parent is perfect. All parents make mistakes, including at least a few big ones.</li>
<li class="calibre12">Try to follow the same rules for parenting that you follow for self-discipline. If you’re harsh on yourself for your parenting mistakes, you’re sapping your own energy and rendering yourself weak and ineffective. Holding yourself responsible is not the same thing as kicking yourself.</li>
<li class="calibre12">Like everyone else, you’ve been parenting according to what you’ve known and experienced yourself. You haven’t been able to offer your own children the emotional strengths that you didn’t have yourself. The fact that you’re reading this book (and this particular chapter) means that you care and that you’re ready and strong enough to change. You already have a great advantage over your own parents.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="h"><a id="chapter08section02" class="calibre1"></a>2. The Changes You Have Made So Far</h4>
<p class="para">Perhaps you’ve already been making some changes in yourself as you’ve been reading this book. If you have, then your children already may have had some reactions to those changes. Are you saying no more often? Are you more often putting yourself first? Are you making your own <a id="page_181" class="calibre3"></a>enjoyment a higher priority? These are all healthy changes for you that will also have positive affects for your children. Unfortunately, they may not realize that quite yet. Children just react when they don’t get what they want. But that doesn’t mean that it’s bad that they didn’t get what they wanted. They’ll benefit greatly from seeing you value yourself and your own needs. It will enable them to grow up valuing themselves and their own needs.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">Your child will need help adjusting to the changes you’ve made. And you will need to combat the effects of Emotional Neglect that may have trickled down from you to them. If you see your child reacting to the changes you’ve made, try not to react to her reaction. Instead, dive <em class="calibre6">underneath</em> her behavior by asking yourself, “<em class="calibre6">What is she feeling right now?”</em> Then gently feed it back to her, like this: “<em class="calibre6">I know you’re not used to me saying no about this, Honey. I’m sorry, I know it must be hard for you when I start making different decisions.”</em> This will not stop her from being upset about your saying no. But you’ll be amazed at how much it helps when you simply validate her feelings. More about this later.</p>
<h4 class="h"><a id="chapter08section03" class="calibre1"></a>3. Identify Your Own Specific Parenting Challenges</h4>
<p class="para">The best way to know how your Emotional Neglect is affecting your children is to go back to look at how it’s affected you. Whatever holes or gaps you have in your emotional health will be the same holes or gaps that your children will be more likely to have, unless you fill them. Let’s look again at the list of adult characteristics that emotionally neglected people are often left with. As you read through the list, put a check mark beside each item that you identified with as you read Chapter 3.</p>
<p class="para">&#160;</p>
<p class="para-hang"><strong class="calibre4">1.feelings of emptiness</strong></p>
<p class="para-hang"><strong class="calibre4">2.counter-dependence</strong></p>
<p class="para-hang"><strong class="calibre4">3.unrealistic self-appraisal</strong></p>
<p class="para-hang"><strong class="calibre4">4.no compassion for self, plenty for others</strong></p>
<p class="para-hang"><strong class="calibre4">5.self-directed anger, self-blame</strong></p>
<p class="para-hang"><strong class="calibre4">6.guilt and shame: what is wrong with me?</strong></p>
<p class="para-hang"><a id="page_182" class="calibre3"></a><strong class="calibre4">7.fatal flaw (if people really know me they won’t like me)</strong></p>
<p class="para-hang"><strong class="calibre4">8.difficulty nurturing self and others</strong></p>
<p class="para-hang"><strong class="calibre4">9.poor self-discipline</strong></p>
<p class="para-hang"><strong class="calibre4">10. alexithymia: poor awareness and understanding of emotions</strong></p>
<p class="para">&#160;</p>
<p class="indent-para1">If you’re not sure about a particular characteristic, please go back and read about it in Chapter 3. Don’t over-think it; listen to your gut. This is not about what you <em class="calibre6">think</em>. It’s about what you <em class="calibre6">feel.</em> Ask yourself <em class="calibre6">if you feel that this particular issue applies to you</em>. You must trust your feelings on this, and that will have an added bonus of being good practice for you in learning to trust your feelings more in general.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">Now that you’ve identified the adult characteristics of your Emotional Neglect, let’s talk about how each of these plays out in the context of parenting.</p>
<p class="para3">1. Emptiness vs. <strong class="calibre4">Filled With Premium Grade</strong></p>
<p class="para">Empty feelings arise from not having been filled up emotionally as a child. Something was missing in your connection with your parents, a fullness in the quality and/or quantity of emotional connection as a child. Let’s think of the quality of your family’s emotional connection as a fuel grade. A child who grows up with <em class="calibre6">enough</em> regular octane or above will probably not have a problem with emptiness as an adult.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">If you received lower-grade fuel as a child, and you are experiencing emptiness as an adult, there’s a good chance that you may not be providing your own children with <em class="calibre6">enough</em> high octane fuel. If this rings a bell for you, it’s very important to realize that <em class="calibre6">this is not your fault</em>. You can’t give your child what you don’t have yourself. Also it’s important that you know there is a solution to this dilemma. It’s not a simple formula; it’s not a checklist, and it has nothing to do with changing your behavior. In fact, <em class="calibre6">the only way to give your child what you don’t have yourself is to provide yourself with what you don’t have.</em> Only then can your child benefit.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">Here’s how it works. As you work on all of the exercises presented in Chapter 6 designed to teach you to value your emotions, you will become <a id="page_183" class="calibre3"></a>a more connected, expressive and richly aware human being. As you go through the Chapter 7 change process, you’ll be increasing the octane level of your own tank. The richer your own fuel becomes, the richer the fuel you’ll be filling your children with. The more you care about yourself, love yourself, understand yourself, and value your emotional self, the more you’ll care, love, understand and value your children and their emotions. Gradually you’ll have less empty feelings, and gradually your children will become less prone to emptiness. Their tanks will be filled with rich, long-burning, premium grade love for self and others that will keep them going for their entire lives.</p>
<p class="para3">2. Counter-dependence vs. <strong class="calibre4">Mutually Interdependent:</strong></p>
<p class="para">If you have this adult characteristic, it means that at some point you received a message from your parents that it’s not acceptable for you to depend upon or need other people. Your own parents’ lack of attention to, lack of tolerance for, or failure to fulfill your emotional needs sent you a clear message that you’d better be <em class="calibre6">fiercely independent</em>. You’d better avoid needing attention or help. You’d better provide for yourself.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">Now take a moment to ponder this question: can you think of any ways in which you might be giving this message to your own children as you raise them? Given that you’ve grown up valuing fierce independence, it would make sense that you’d value teaching your children to be this way. Or maybe you haven’t thought about it at all, and you just automatically do what you know, as all parents naturally tend to do. Either way, you’re setting your children up to miss out on the great advantages of being mutually interdependent with their fellow human beings.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">“What the heck is mutual interdependence?” you might say. Mutual interdependence is the ideal balance for relationships between adults, be they marriage or friendship (I am excluding parent/child relationships because a tremendous amount of dependency is naturally built into the parent/child relationship.) Mutual interdependence means that both parties in the relationship are capable of a healthy level of independence and self-reliance, but each member of the relationship relies on the other <a id="page_184" class="calibre3"></a>for some things and at some times. Each person is maximized in their potential to care for themselves, but maximized even further by the addition of what the other person has to offer.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">If you give your children the message that they are not to depend on others, you are depriving them of the valuable strengths which the other people in their lives can bring them. These strengths could be any way in which another person enriches or enlivens us or lessens our burden. Just a few simple examples from the vast sea of possibilities might be comforting words and a soothing touch, help moving furniture or a well-cooked meal. There must be a balance in our lives that allows us to give and take, love and be loved, care and be cared for. It’s mutual Interdependence. And you and your children deserve to have it.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">As a parent, how do you raise your children with this kind of balance that doesn’t come naturally to you? The reality is, it’s not easy. The good news is that the changes you make in your own counter-dependence will trickle down to your children. The less afraid you become to rely on others, the less afraid your children will be to rely on others. But here’s the most important aspect of that: the more you’re there for your children <em class="calibre6">when they need you</em> the more mutually inter-dependent they will be. Don’t be afraid of making them too dependent. The only way to do that is to help them too often, in too many ways, when they <em class="calibre6">don’t</em> need help.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">In order to be there for your children when they need you but not overdo it, you must be in tune with your child. Remember third-grade Zeke’s Sociopathic mom, who sent him to his room to write “I will never get in trouble at school again” fifty times in cursive? She was an extreme example of a parent who’s out of tune with her child’s capabilities. A mother who has such a skewed view of what her child can and cannot do developmentally will be a poor judge of when to step in to help her child.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">So to be able to distinguish correctly when you should provide your child with help, it will help to follow the example that was given in Chapter 1, <em class="calibre6">Healthy vs. Emotionally Neglectful Parenting</em>, which also used third-grade Zeke. You must <strong class="calibre4">feel an emotional connection</strong> to your child so that you’ll know when it’s time to step in and soothe and help <a id="page_185" class="calibre3"></a>him; you must <strong class="calibre4">pay attention</strong> to your child to give you a good idea of what he truly can and can’t do, so you’ll know when he genuinely needs help; you must <strong class="calibre4">respond competently</strong>, which means providing him with meaningful and appropriate help.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">No parent is perfect at all of these steps. All you can do is try your best. If you do, your children will love and appreciate you in a different way, because they’ll feel that you understand them and that they have support and help when they need it. They’ll be more willing to reach higher, have richer relationships, and better fulfill their own potential. They’ll be both independent and able to take in help from others. They’ll feel less alone in the world throughout their entire lives.</p>
<p class="para3">3. Unrealistic self-appraisal vs. <strong class="calibre4">Strong, Clear Sense of Self</strong></p>
<p class="para">This adult characteristic basically comes down to not really knowing who you are. Remember how we talked about children learning about themselves by seeing themselves reflected in their parents’ eyes? That reflection is hard to catch when your parents aren’t looking at you much. If you as an adult have a view of yourself that’s not clear or not based in reality, it probably means that your parents didn’t do <em class="calibre6">well enough</em> at paying attention to you. This may mean that they didn’t spend enough time with you, but not necessarily. A parent can be with their child 24/7 (not that that would be healthy) and still not be seeing his child. <strong class="calibre4">Paying attention</strong> in this case doesn’t mean pouring juice as needed. And it doesn’t refer to the artful placement of a pretty hair barrette. It means noticing your child’s natural likes and dislikes and strengths and weaknesses, remembering them, and feeding them back helpfully to the child. This is how a child internalizes a realistic sense of who she is.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">One of the <strong class="calibre4">Change Sheets</strong> was on <em class="calibre6">Likes and Dislikes</em>. This sheet was designed to help you become more aware of the things you innately enjoy and don’t enjoy. Likes and dislikes feed into self-appraisal, as do abilities, appearance, personality traits, intellect, social skills and preferences, habits, and the almost endless factors that make up who you are. The process you use to learn your likes and dislikes can also be used to learn <a id="page_186" class="calibre3"></a>more about the complexities of who you are. And that process also applies to your parenting.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">As you parent your children, it’s important that every day you pay attention, and that every day you give them helpful feedback. This doesn’t mean being overly critical or negative because that can be damaging to their self-esteem. But if you see your son excelling at football far more than baseball, you can say, for example, “You are a football machine!” You should not say that to him about baseball if it isn’t true. But you shouldn’t say, “You’re not good at baseball,” because that’s too negative and could be damaging.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">Reflect back to your child the academic skills with which she naturally excels. Reflect back the skill with which she tends to struggle, for instance, “We need to spend more time on math.” If your child seems to have little talent on the violin but loves to play it, point out to him that you admire his love of music and his willingness to work hard to master something. Avoid giving feedback that’s too harsh or might hurt your child’s feelings. Avoid giving feedback that’s not realistic. Be honest and loving, caring and clear.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">Sometimes you have to just be there, observe and say nothing. Your child will absorb your watchfulness and will see his own reflection. During the eighteen-plus years that you’re raising him, he’ll look into his parental mirror again and again. He’ll see this piece of himself and that piece of himself. He’ll see the pieces grow, change and develop. The pieces will coalesce into an accurate reflection of a full and complete person, and that person will know what he wants and what he’s capable of. He will be starting his adult life with a tremendous advantage that you didn’t have: a full, clear and strong picture of who he is. That is a gift only you could give him.</p>
<p class="para3">4. No compassion for self vs. <strong class="calibre4">Compassion</strong></p>
<p class="para">As a parent, you do not want your children to grow up treating themselves harshly, kicking themselves for their own mistakes. You want your child to learn from his mistakes, to keep growing and loving himself. It’s your <a id="page_187" class="calibre3"></a>job to teach your child compassion for others and for himself. To do this, you can apply the same four Self-Compassion Principles that we talked about in Chapter 7. If you have compassion for your children, they will have it for themselves and others.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">Remember that the first Compassion Principle is the Reverse Golden Rule. Here’s how it applies to parenthood:</p>
<p class="para">&#160;</p>
<p class="extractb"><em class="calibre6">“Do unto your child as you wish your parents had done unto you.”</em></p>
<p class="indent-para1">A parent who grew up emotionally neglected cannot follow her default settings for parenting. Since her default settings were determined by her primary caregivers, those settings will likely result in her passing down her own Emotional Neglect to her child. As a parent, it’s vital to work hard to override your own settings and create healthier ones for your child. So when your child makes a bad decision, screws up, does something thoughtless or wrong, it will be important for you to do your best not to react immediately. Impulsive, emotional reactions will be determined by your default settings. Instead, take a moment and think: If I were my child, what would I need from my parent right now so that I can learn from this and move on?</p>
<p class="indent-para1">The second Self-Compassion Principle, when applied to parenting, involves watching and responding when you see your child being hard on himself. If you see your child punishing himself for his mistakes or being excessively angry with himself, it’s time to step in and help. Point out that his anger at himself is excessive and misplaced. Even if it doesn’t seem to help him in the moment, it will plant a seed in the back of his mind that will grow. Then use your self-soothing skills to comfort your child so that he can internalize them.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">The third Self-Compassion Principle is to give your child the benefit of your wisdom and compassion. In order for your child to learn to forgive herself, she must experience forgiveness from you. She will internalize the level of harshness that you deliver to her. This encapsulates both of the previous principles because it involves responding to your child’s mistakes <a id="page_188" class="calibre3"></a>by appropriately holding her responsible, intervening when you see her being too harsh on herself, helping her understand her mistake and the situation and, in the end, forgiving her. When you do all of these things for her, she’ll learn to do them for herself.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">Helping your child develop an inner loving-but-firm voice, the fourth Self-Compassion Principle, is vital to helping her have compassion for herself. Remember the example given in Chapter 7 of the healthy internal voice to use after running out of gas? That’s a good template to use for your children as well. In the role of parent, talk through what happened and why, and help her determine for herself where she went wrong. Then reassure her that the point of making mistakes is to learn from them. Walk her through the process of understanding, owning, learning and forgiving. This process is extremely valuable and will set your child up to be able to provide the support and accountability that’s vital to being a successful and strong adult who has love and compassion for herself and others.</p>
<p class="para3">5. Guilt and shame vs. <strong class="calibre4">Healthy Self-Acceptance</strong></p>
<p class="para">Remember what causes guilt and shame in the emotionally neglected? It’s the absence of parental acceptance and validation of the child’s feelings, which eventually causes the child to feel that something is wrong with him for having emotions. Since everyone has emotions, the child may eventually become ashamed of this part of himself, trying to hide them from others and even from himself. What then, as a parent, can you do to make sure this doesn’t happen for your child? Accept and validate his emotions, of course.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">As a parent who was emotionally neglected yourself, this may be more difficult than it sounds. It will require you to become more comfortable with emotions in general. You will need to be tolerant of what your child is feeling, even if you think your child’s feelings are excessive or incorrect.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">Here are some suggestions for how to understand and accept your child’s emotions. To illustrate this, let’s think of your child’s feelings as water flowing from him.</p>
<ul class="calibre13">
<li class="calibre12"><a id="page_189" class="calibre3"></a>If you put a barrier in front of the flowing water, the water will have to go somewhere. It will go around or over the barrier, or eventually, if it has nowhere to go, it will reverse and head back toward the source (meaning your child will turn his emotions upon himself). No matter what, the water will flow somewhere. <em class="calibre6">You cannot stop the flow of your child’s feelings.</em> So please don’t try.</li>
<li class="calibre12">In order to deal with flowing water, you have to let it flow while you go to the source. So when your child is feeling something, let his feelings flow while at the same time trying to get back to the original cause of the feeling. This may involve asking your child some questions to help you both understand, or thinking back to situations that might have caused or intensified these feelings.</li>
<li class="calibre12">Watch out for the danger of letting your child’s feelings flood himself and you. Although it’s not advisable to try to stop your child’s feelings, there is a time to step in to help him manage them. Stopping and helping to manage are not the same thing. It’s the difference between “Big boys don’t cry” and “Let’s figure out together what’s going on here and what we can do about it.”</li>
<li class="calibre12">Keep in mind that your child’s feelings are a basic part of him, rooted in his human anatomy. He must not get a message from you that he’s not to have them, but he must learn from you that it’s possible and necessary to manage them.</li>
<li class="calibre12">Use the emotion management skills from Chapter 6 to help your child learn these essential skills.</li>
<li class="calibre12">Use emotion management skills for yourself, and your child will also learn them by example.</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent-para1">If you do your best to follow all of the principles of emotion management above, you’ll teach your child the opposite of guilt and shame. You’ll be giving him essential skills that he’ll use in every area of his life. He’ll get the message from you that his feelings are a normal, healthy part of his identity; that he should listen to what they’re telling <a id="page_190" class="calibre3"></a>him, but that he is not at their mercy. As a result, he’ll grow up accepting, and even valuing, this vital, connecting, and enriching part of himself.</p>
<p class="para3">6. Self-blame vs. <strong class="calibre4">Forgiving</strong></p>
<p class="para">Forgiving is the final stage of Self-Compassion. When your child makes a poor choice or mistake, you will use the Compassion Principles to help her understand what part of her mistake is herself, what part is someone else and what part is the circumstances. Then you’ll help her figure out how to correct her mistake and prevent it from happening again. Then you’ll help her forgive herself and put it behind her.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">You will put all of this time and energy into your parenting because you have personal experience with what happened for you when your parents didn’t. You realize from your own experience that if we don’t move on from the many mistakes we’ll make in our lifetime, we’ll become stuck in them. If we don’t forgive ourselves, our mistakes can become an unnecessarily large part of us. They can take over our sense of self, and can even become who we are. You don’t want your child to be defined by her mistakes, as perhaps you have been by yours. Teach her that final step: how to <em class="calibre6">put that mistake behind her.</em> Then her mistakes will stay in proportion to reality, and she’ll be freed up to take appropriate risks in a healthy way while keeping her self-esteem and self-love intact.</p>
<p class="para3">7. Fatal Flaw vs. <strong class="calibre4">Likable and Lovable</strong></p>
<p class="para">You probably remember that the Fatal Flaw is a feeling of being damaged somehow: “If you get to know me well enough you won’t like me.” It runs rampant in the emotionally neglected because of the <em class="calibre6">absence</em> of positive affection and notice from their parents. I can’t tell you how many emotionally neglected adults, when asked if they grew up <em class="calibre6">feeling</em> loved, will answer, “I always <em class="calibre6">knew</em> my parents loved me.” Knowing is not feeling, and feeling is the key here.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">It is vital to make sure that your child not only knows but <em class="calibre6">feels</em> that you like and love her. Warm, caring hugs, laughter, and truly enjoying your child’s personality all go a long way toward conveying that <em class="calibre6">feeling</em> <a id="page_191" class="calibre3"></a>to your child. I know this may sound like Parenting 101, but this is one of those things that many emotionally neglected people grew up without enough of. And if it doesn’t come naturally to you, you may have to cultivate it for the good of your child.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">To take it one step further, an essential step in preventing your child from carrying the Fatal Flaw is to deal with your own. The Fatal Flaw is one of those characteristics which seems to be transferred from parent to child almost by osmosis. It seeps through from the parent to the child unnoticed and unrealized, becoming a part of the child’s identity, just as it is of the parent’s. Because it’s a complex and underground emotion, people seldom are aware that they have it, and they certainly can’t put it into words. Instead, it’s an ever present feeling that drives many of their decisions and hangs over them like a black cloud (remember Carrie in Chapter 3). But the bottom line is if you don’t feel this way about yourself, you won’t have to worry about the osmosis factor.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">I hope that in reading this section, it has been clear how much your feelings about yourself percolate through to your children. If you <em class="calibre6">feel</em> love for yourself, you have a much greater capacity for <em class="calibre6">feeling</em> love for your child. If you have a strong sense of self-worth, it will seep through to your child, who will also have self-worth. The main point is: when you deal with what’s missing inside of you, those absences will not be transferred to your children.</p>
<p class="para3">8. Difficulty nurturing vs. <strong class="calibre4">Giving and Caring</strong></p>
<p class="para">When you were growing up emotionally neglected, you probably experienced gaps in the nurturance you got from your parents. Perhaps you were cared for very well in some areas, physically, for example, but not in others. Nurturing is like a warm type of caretaking. It’s giving paired with care. Remember Dave, who had such a hard time with nurturance that he resented his daughter for making him care about her? Dave was, as we talked about, like a sponge too long away from water. His emotional self had become dry and brittle, so he had great difficulty taking anything in and giving anything out.</p>
<p class="indent-para1"><a id="page_192" class="calibre3"></a>Your job now, as a parent who had spotty nurturing at best from your parents, is to make sure that your child never runs dry. Every special thing you do to make sure your child feels taken care of sets him up to be able and willing to give that to others. You will want your child to have the best possible success in his own marriage and with his own children. If you give him plenty of warm caretaking throughout his life, he will have it in copious amounts to give to the people he loves.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">Here are some ideas to help you provide your child with emotional nurturance:</p>
<ul class="calibre13">
<li class="calibre12">Spontaneously give your child a hug when you notice he looks sad.</li>
<li class="calibre12">Ask her if she’s OK if you think she might be upset.</li>
<li class="calibre12">Spend extra time with your child when you feel he needs it.</li>
<li class="calibre12">If your child is going through a transition, or any difficult phase, e.g., school starting or ending, a move, change of friends, etc., talk about it with her and do something special for her to show that you notice what she’s going through.</li>
<li class="calibre12">Be aware in general of what he is feeling. Help him become aware of his feelings and put words to them. Accept and validate those feelings. He will experience all of this as nurturing.</li>
</ul>
<p class="para3">9. Poor self-discipline vs. <strong class="calibre4">In Control</strong></p>
<p class="para">As we talked about before, your own struggles with self-discipline quite likely reflect something about the discipline you received from your parents. Children left to their own devices will quickly learn to indulge themselves. They may also learn how to be quite hard on themselves. They may learn to call themselves lazy, a procrastinator or a shopaholic. What they will <em class="calibre6">not</em> learn is how to make themselves do what they don’t want to do, and how to stop themselves from doing what they shouldn’t do. Your child will not learn this either, unless you give her what you have <a id="page_193" class="calibre3"></a>trouble providing for yourself: structure, clear rules, and appropriate, predictable consequences.</p>
<p class="indent-para1"><span class="underline">Structure:</span> When you provide structure for your child, you’re teaching him how to structure himself. For example, bedtime is 9:00 on school nights. That’s a reasonable rule. As you set and enforce it with your child, you’re teaching her how to set a rule in her own head and follow it. Another example might be an hour of homework after school before she can go outside. This forces her to override her own impulses at your behest. When she’s older and has control over her own time, she’ll carry that ability to overrule her impulses with her. If she can structure herself, she’ll be far less likely to procrastinate.</p>
<p class="indent-para1"><span class="underline">Rules:</span> Once you’ve set up a structure for your child that’s firm but reasonably flexible, it’s really important to make that structure clear to your child. To some extent self-discipline is the ability to set clear rules for oneself and then make oneself follow them. That’s what healthy discipline involves in your role as parent. Make sure the rules are clear, age-appropriate and easy to follow. Post them on the refrigerator, announce them in family meeting. Don’t change them without reason or without informing your child. Your child must know clearly what’s expected of him.</p>
<p class="indent-para1"><span class="underline">Consequences:</span> Your child must know what will happen if he breaks a rule. “If you don’t take out the trash on Tuesday, there will be hell to pay” doesn’t work. “If you don’t take out the trash on Tuesday, I’ll take away your iPod until you’ve done it” does work, because the consequence is clear. “If you don’t take out the trash on Tuesday I’ll give your iPod to charity” doesn’t work because that consequence is inappropriately harsh. It doesn’t fit the crime. Your consequence has to be both clear and appropriate, and, on top of that, it must be reliably delivered. The delivery of the consequence can’t depend upon whether you’re paying attention or have the energy to give it. Your child needs to know that you mean business and he needs to know what to expect from you. Anything less will teach him nothing other than how to break rules and how to have problems with self-discipline.</p>
<p class="para3"><a id="page_194" class="calibre3"></a>10. Alexithymia vs. <strong class="calibre4">Emotionally Aware</strong></p>
<p class="para">During your reading of this book you may have realized that emotional awareness is one of the greatest gifts that you can give your children. You want your child to know what she’s feeling and why, and be able to put it into words. You also want her to have skills for figuring out what other people are feeling and to be able to somewhat deduce the reasons for others’ feelings and actions. These are important aspects of what Daniel Goldman calls <em class="calibre6">Emotional Intelligence</em>. Scientific studies conducted by Goldman show that high Emotional Intelligence is a greater predictor of success than is high intellectual intelligence. Emotionally intelligent people have a huge advantage in navigating the world. This includes the workplace as well as marriage, social situations, and parenting.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">Knowing how important these skills are, how do you make sure that your child has them? First of all, everything we’ve talked about in this chapter will contribute to your child’s emotional awareness. But on top of that, there is more that you can do.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">Your child will learn little, if anything, about emotion in school. This part of his education is up to you. Here are the five steps to follow to teach your child about emotion so that he’ll have a high level of emotional awareness:</p>
<ol class="calibre11">
<li value="1" class="calibre12">Pay attention and notice what your child is feeling.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre12">Make an effort to feel what your child is feeling.</li>
<li value="3" class="calibre12">Put the feelings into words for her and teach her how to use her own words to express her feelings. Use the Feeling Word List in the Resource Section as needed to help you with this.</li>
<li value="4" class="calibre12">Use your Vertical Questioning skills to help him understand the reasons for his feelings.</li>
<li value="5" class="calibre12">Make emotions an important part of life. Keep emotional language in your everyday vernacular. This alone will convey the value and importance of emotion to your child and will stimulate her interest in understanding the <em class="calibre6">feeling</em> part of life.</li>
</ol>
<p class="indent-para1"><a id="page_195" class="calibre3"></a>As you were reading this section, did you start to feel guilty? Did you judge yourself for not doing everything right? If so, it’s understandable. It means that you are just like many other caring parents. No parent is fault-free. Every parent falls down in some of these areas. Every parent struggles, and every parent fails at times. As an emotionally neglected parent, you have added challenges. You must have compassion for yourself, learn from your mistakes and continue to put in the effort as you move forward.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">If you were able to identify the areas in which your Emotional Neglect affects you and read in this chapter what to do about it, there’s a tremendous possibility that you’ll be able to correct these issues for your children. Children are amazingly resilient, so they bounce back well. Teenagers are slower to respond to parents’ changes, but they do respond. You can’t give in to your default settings. You must fight the fight for your own sake as well as for the sake of your children.</p>
<p class="indent-para1">Parenting is one of the greatest privileges we are accorded as human beings. No matter what hand we are dealt, it’s our biological and social imperative to deal an improved hand to our children. It’s our job to reshuffle the cards, and take more time and care than our parents did to give our children advantages that we didn’t have. I promise you that there is nothing in this world that will fill <em class="calibre6">your</em> tank with a higher premium fuel than dealing your children a better hand than you received yourself. It’s the most fulfilling, positive, loving, enriching and heroic thing you will ever accomplish. You’ll feel it every step of the way. Your children will become the best possible versions of themselves, and so will you.</p>
