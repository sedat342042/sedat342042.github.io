<p class="indent-para"><a id="page_ii" class="calibre3"></a>Jonice Webb has written a terrific book about what you didn’t get in childhood - what wasn’t there that should have been: guidance, attunement; in some cases, love. The damage caused by emotional neglect and what to do to heal it are the subjects of this exciting, readable, and potentially life changing work.</p>

<p class="indent-para1">In a compelling and articulate way, <em class="calibre6">Running on Empty</em> shines an important light on the emotional legacy passed down to us from our parents. It helps make clear how the parenting we receive as children affects us emotionally and socially in adulthood. In a rich, warm, empathic voice, Dr. Webb speaks directly to us, helping us identify our emotional roadblocks, and providing a path through them.</p>

<p class="indent-para1">Reading Dr. Webb’s <em class="calibre6">Running on Empty</em> immediately impacted my work as a child and adolescent psychologist. Her conceptualization of emotional neglect and its myriad effects on the developing child is crystal clear, and one that I have not seen elsewhere. Dr. Webb provides tools so clinicians can identify patterns of emotional neglect that may be occurring in the families with whom they are working. More importantly, <em class="calibre6">Running on Empty</em> offers the clinician practical guidelines to help parents of children and adolescents stop emotional neglect in its tracks.</p>
