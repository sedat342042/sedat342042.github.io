				<p class="ortayazi">TURKEY AND EUROPE: LOOKING TO THE<br class="chapter"/>FUTURE FROM A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE</p>
				<p class="normal">I.</p>
				<p class="normal">I will try to address the relationship between Turkey and the European Union, against the background of history.</p>
				<p class="normal">In fact, our long history has been moulded through an ongoing process of interaction with the West and with the East. As a country and people, we have been situated at the crossroads of civilisations. Historically, we lived in a very large geography which provided for the main trade-routes and for the dissemination of ideas and religions. Therefore, the external environment, external dynamics, and the interaction with Europe, confrontational and harmonious at times were among the decisive factors in our historical development. Thus, the Turkish / Ottoman presence in Europe during the15th, 16th and 17th centuries brought forward new ideals and new patterns of social relationships. Given the realities of an era when feudalism, lack of tolerance and exploitation of masses prevailed, humane values and a highly egalitarian, efficient and sophisticated organisation was introduced.</p>
				<p class="normal">This new civilisation and its moral values contributed to the evolution of Middle Ages into modern times. It turned Turkey into the safe-haven of the persecuted ethnic and religious masses in the 16th century and onwards, a role, which Turkey had to resume through the II. World War.</p>
				<p class="normal">As modern times approached, the historical interaction with the West contributed the external dynamics, mainly positive, for the institutional reformation of Turkey in the 19th and 20th centuries.</p>
				<p class="normal">It is interesting to note that the founding-leaders of the Turkish Republic in the early 1920’s, coming out of battlefields where they faced the Western invasion forces, were mainly inspired by Western models to create a democratic society and a secular Republic. This bears witness to our pragmatic sense, but also to Turkey’s ability to overlook past grievances and to create the future.</p>
				<p class="normal">II.</p>
				<p class="normal">The historical development of Turkey, its cosmopolitan characteristics, its civilisation which comprises western as well as eastern values, a multitude of beliefs and ethnicities, bestowed upon Turkey a unique identity:</p>
				<p class="normal">We consider ourselves both European and Asian, and view this plurality to be an asset.</p>
				<p class="normal">Our history was moulded as much in Istanbul, Edirne, Tetova, Kosovo and Sarajevo as it was in Bursa, Kayseri, Diyarbakir and Damascus.</p>
				<p class="normal">If ‘European Culture’ is defined, as it is by the eu, that is, mainly by factors such as ‘democracy’, ‘human rights’, ‘rule of law’, ‘gender equality’, and ‘secularism’, then, in spite of the need for further progress on some points, we have shared and contributed to this contemporary ‘European culture’ for 75 years.</p>
				<p class="normal">I want to elaborate on a few elements of ‘European Culture’, for it seems that sometimes there is a need to contribute mutually to a better understanding:</p>
				<p class="normal">I have always said, as a writer, politician, and as a Minister as well, that there are some delays in certain points in our democratic development. This, in spite of the fact that Turkey is among the front-runners in Europe in some fields of democracy as gender equality, women’s votes, secularism, upward mobility, etc. I have as well stated that in some of the criticism formulated, the departing points might generally be justified. But, the overall conclusions, as well as the distorted and inflated image which sometimes comes about, are unjustified.</p>
				<p class="normal">It is not an excuse or a pretext, but it is obvious that the difficulties we faced in developing certain points of our democracy is mainly due to the horrible terrorist campaign which we faced. During the last 15 years, the terrorists have killed thousands of civilians. There were cases like that of the 128 primary-school teachers who were executed in groups.</p>
				<p class="normal">As our Prime Minister Mr. Ecevit has explained, the more we free ourselves from the constraints of terrorism, the greater will be the momentum of democratic reforms. Actually, we are in the process of overcoming terrorism. Some positive changes are already taking place:</p>
				<p class="normal">It is interesting to note that, during the last three months, the Parliament, through a record-breaking performance, has enacted two major constitutional changes and sixty-two laws, including several legislative reforms. Several were of the nature of a democratic reform. Frankly, I do not think these would have been possible about a year ago, when terrorism was not as limited in its scope as it is today.</p>
				<p class="normal">I would also like to underline that the conceptual and legislative changes that are taking place represent an ongoing trend; a trend which is initiated by Turkey’s internal dynamics.</p>
				<p class="normal">III.</p>
				<p class="normal">One of the causes of some misunderstandings is the difference of perceptions which are based on different historical experiences.</p>
				<p class="normal">In analyzing and understanding the social fabric of Turkey, criteria based on race, as a distinctive and major tool leads to wrong assumptions.</p>
				<p class="normal">We do not conceive of the racial origin of our citizens as a relevant factor in Turkey. No one really cares about the race of anyone. Ottoman and Republican Turkey being a geography with millennia of history, we are composed of numerous ethnic backgrounds and cultures.</p>
				<p class="normal">The concept of race as a distinctive factor and as the main attribute of ‘minorities’ does not fit in our realities and perceptions. In Turkey, where the Ottoman interpretation and implementation of Islam is one of the main components of cultural identity and where for centuries the state had to keep united a multitude of ethnicities, ‘race’ did not exist as a social and political category. The main distinctive factor had been religious, implemented with great tolerance, and the difference was always conceived in religious concepts, i.e., the Muslims and the non-Muslims. On the other hand, ‘Muslim Ottoman Subjects’, whether in Sarajevo, Kosovo, Istanbul, Kayseri, Cairo, Haleppo or elsewhere, and of whatever ethnic origin, were totally equal in their status.</p>
				<p class="normal">This is the background of our present perceptions. Contemporary Turkey based itself on this heritage of non-discrimination; and devloped it through its modernisation process. When some West European scholars apply their version of social analysis based on their particular socio-cultural experience to a country like Turkey, they are misled. They end up with an overemphasis on race as a social factor. This is probably why these analyses bring up wrong conclusions and why Muslim Turks whether of Balkan, Kurdish, Caucasian, or of whatever origin are somewhat irritated when they discover that they are considered as ‘minorities’ by the West European discourse.</p>
				<p class="normal">One last point on the subject, a political one: I have to state that I am strongly against policies and parties based on ethnic lines. Underlining and promoting racial differences in a country generally leads to disastrous results. I believe that this approach should be left to the past, where ethnic cleansing has recently cost 200.000 lives in Bosnia and Kosovo, and, in the not so distant past, caused the loss of 7 million European lives.</p>
				<p class="normal">This, of course, does not mean that I am not, in fact, that we are not, in favor of freedom of cultural and democratic expression for any citizen who feels the need.</p>
				<p class="normal">IV.</p>
				<p class="normal">Considering Turkey’s candidacy and membership, I always ask myself, what is it that Turkey will contribute to the European Union; what will be its genuine input; what will be the enhancement that Turkey will bring to the European Union? And, what will be the advantages which Turkey will have by being part of the European Union?</p>
				<p class="normal">As for advantages, I believe that being part of eu will provide Turkey with a challenge and with a wider opportunity to attain a higher rationale in all aspects of its organisational, political, social, democratic and economic life. The historical, cultural and geographic settings of Turkey which provide for ample interaction with our international environment, enhances the contribution of positive external dynamics.</p>
				<p class="normal">I can refer to the positive aspects of our already existing partnership in the Customs Union: It was a huge challenge, it is only four years old, but this union has motivated Turkey to reach an economic competetiveness and an industrial infrastructure and skill comparable to that of the eu.</p>
				<p class="normal">On the other hand, I do not overlook the limitations and burdens that this partnership has caused. The yearly trade deficit Turkey has with eu countries is around ten billion dollars. We have concerns and proposals which need to be further discussed.</p>
				<p class="normal">But, we are already integrated to the economic dimension of eu. This challenge and this participation have facilitated for us to build the most dynamic and the most competitive economy in a large geography, stretching from Central Europe to Central Asia and to the Middle East. And I have to add that we have achieved this end without any considerable economic assistance from the eu.</p>
				<p class="normal">I believe that initiating the process of being part of the political dimension of eu will bring about parallel results in reaching higher levels of a new rationale. I anticipate a positive interaction.</p>
				<p class="normal">Furthermore, we are now in a better position to take advantage of this process, for we actually benefit from having a strong government and a sound majority in the parliament – a privilege we have not had in Turkey for the last five years.</p>
				<p class="normal">V.</p>
				<p class="normal">What Turkey can contribute to eu is a historical experience of a different kind; a dimension that only a country that for centuries was the representative of a huge geography and a genuine culture can provide. And which, actually represents the assertiveness of its republican and democratic evolution, and its unique role as a ‘model’: Being the only country with a predominantly Muslim population which has the ideals and practices of a pluralist democracy, secularism, rule of law, human rights, gender equality, Turkey enjoys the privilege of constituting a paradigm of modernization. It is a centre of attraction for huge masses of people, all over the world, who aspire to democracy and modernization.</p>
				<p class="normal">Furthermore, the post cold-war political framework witnessed the appearance or the confirmation of several independent states. Out of the multitude of those ‘new’ states, almost all – in the Balkans, in the Caucasus or in Central Asia – are those with whom Turkey shares a common history or a common language and cultural affinity. This provides Turkey with a new international environment of historical and cultural dimensions. Turkey, as a long-standing actor in these geographies, has become a vital partner in their economic restructuring. Turkey thus provides a political and economic center for the emerging Eurasian reality and constitutes Western Europe’s major historical, cultural and economic opening to Eastern horizons.</p>
				<p class="normal">Nevertheless, it seems to me that the eu has not yet firmly decided on its policies vis-à-vis the challenges of emerging new geographies; whether it is interested in the vast opportunities of encompassing new economic, historical and cultural dimensions; whether it can contribute more to the harmonization of civilizations in a world endangered by the much discussed ‘clash’ of civilizations; whether it will assume a larger responsibility to create a better world for all.</p>
				<p class="normal">Turkey contributes to all these causes positively, to some, perhaps, decisively.</p>
				<p class="normal">VI.</p>
				<p class="normal">Inorder to further develop our relations, the confrontational approach that has sometimes been displayed should mutually be put aside. Generally, problems are solved more efficiently if the other party’s sensitivities, concerns and constraints are taken into consideration.</p>
				<p class="normal">Western Europe, for a long period of history, considered Turkey as ‘The Other’, to put it in Edward Said’s terms. Turkey was the anti-thesis, the outsider, and the different. Now there is growing evidence that this unfortunate categorizing is withering away. It is a mutual responsibility to assure that this positive trend further develops.</p>
				<p class="normal">Finally, I expect that a just and clear decision be reached in Helsinki Summit of December 1999. I believe that Turkey should be declared an official candidate for accession to eu.</p>
				<p class="normal">Human values are universal. ‘The Copenhagen Criteria’ are values that are not particular to eu; they are values, which are shared by millions inside and outside Europe. They are values which we share, which we develop, and will continue to develop, whether we are a candidate, a member, or not.</p>
				<p class="normal">I believe in a future which is brighter for Europe. I believe in Turkey’s contribution to this future.</p>
