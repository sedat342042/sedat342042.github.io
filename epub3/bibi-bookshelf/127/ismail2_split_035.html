				<p class="ortayazi">(This article was published in International Herald Tribune, Le Monde, La Nouvelle Belgique and several other West European newspapers, in December 1997)</p>
				<p class="ortayazi">FOR eu, AN ISSUE OF IDENTITY AND VISION</p>
				<p class="normal">Ismail Cem</p>
				<p class="normal">Turkish Foreign Minister</p>
				<p class="normal">Will the future of the European Union be limited by religious and racial connotations or will it be one that reaches out and boldly contributes to the diversity and unity of a much larger geography?</p>
				<p class="normal">The eu is now deciding on its enlargement process. One important decision is what role to offer Turkey, which provides Western Europe’s main historical, cultural and economic link to Eastern horizons. The choice that eu makes will either provide the eu with a crucial bridge of conciliation with civilizations of other characteristics, or will be discriminatory and have no effect or even negative effects on the persisting dichotomies.</p>
				<p class="normal">This seems to be the choice which eu will make on the 12th of December, by the Luxembourg Summit.</p>
				<p class="normal">We consider ourselves both European and Asian, and view this duality to be an asset. Therefor we are disturbed when the European trait in our identity is questioned: If being European is a “historical” or “geographical” definition, we live and we have lived 700 years of our history in Europe, and as a European power. Our history was molded as much in Istanbul, Edirne, Tetova and Sarajevo as it was in Bursa, Kayseri and Diyarbakir.</p>
				<p class="normal">If being European is a “cultural” definition, things get a bit more complicated: If “European” is defined by a religious criteria, if the eu is a “Christian Club” then the setting is not appropriate. But if “European Culture” is defined as the eu officially claims, that is, by factors such as “democracy”, “human rights”, “rule of law”, “gender equality”, “secularism”, etc., then, in spite of needs for further progress on some issues, we have shared and contributed to this contemporary “European culture” for 75 years.</p>
				<p class="normal">Then, we ask ourselves, where is the “real problem”?</p>
				<p class="normal">What is it which justifies the negation of declared eu commitments made to Turkey over a period of three decades? What is it which causes the reluctance to call a country that has an association agreement with eu since 1963, a country which is part of the eu Customs Union, a “candidate”? Why is there such a discrimination against a nato member who has contributed extensively to the defense of Europe? Against one of the most dynamic economies of Europe, a country which will bring a lot in term of markets and growth to the whole of Europe?</p>
				<p class="normal">My counterparts from the eu name three sets of “reasons” or “conditions”: Greece, Cyprus and Human Rights. In the four months our government has been in office, progress was achieved in all three issues. Furthermore, I have been able to explain and –hopefully– convince my counterparts of several points:</p>
				<p class="normal">On relations with Greece, a member country, conventional criticism is generally unfounded. First, we need two sides to solve a bilateral problem; one of the sides can not be held responsible when both parties must contribute for a solution. Second, though I cannot claim to be an “objective observer” I can sincerely state that at least in my time in office Turkey has done everything possible to improve relations. The third parties involved in negotiations to promote a better understanding between the two neighbors can bear witness to our efforts. The parallel declarations of goodwill by Prime Ministers Yilmaz and Simitis in Crete is a cautiously promising start.</p>
				<p class="normal">As for the Cyprus issue, there has to be a positive approach from four sides, even five, when we include the u.k., the other guarantor country. Again, Turkey can not be held as the only responsible actor when there are many involved. The Greek Cypriot side, at the eve of elections, is far from the compromises and concessions needed for a process of conciliation. The Turkish Cypriot side insists on equal recognition. This position seems to draw some positive attention now, especially from the u.s. special representative Richard Holbrook. Furthermore, the recent statements by President Denktas on the probability of forming a “joint government” in Cyprus to tackle problems of Cyprus and of the eu, give some cautious but hopeful signals. I have to note, though, that the announced deployment of S-300 missiles by the Greek Cypriots has further aggravated an already sensitive situation.</p>
				<p class="normal">In my recent talks with my eu counterparts, I have thoroughly addressed the “human rights and democracy” problems. I stated that I agree with most of the well-intentioned criticism but reject politically motivated and exaggerated claims. I have to add that during my government’s time in office, there has been considerable progress. Some positive legal acts concerning prison sentences were realized. With the separatist terrorism within Turkey declining, three out of the nine provinces that have been under a state of emergency for ten years, have been returned to full democracy. Several others are expected to follow. This might have already happened if the u.s. and Iraq had not come so close to a military confrontation and stimulated fears of a new wave of Iraqi refugees flooding into those provinces.</p>
				<p class="normal">Yes, we have our specific issues which need further improvement, like any other country. But after all, Turkey and the eu are not talking about immediate membership. Rather, we are referring to a long accession process, which would also aid in the elimination of some of the above-mentioned problems.</p>
				<p class="normal">If the “three sets of conditions” –generally referred to as obstacles– are either dealt with positively by the current Turkish government and / or they are out of the unilateral reach of Turkey, then what is the cause of this negative approach by the eu? On the eve of the new millenium, is the undeclared cause for discrimination, as Mr. Jacques Attali recently stated, the fact that Turkey is a Moslem country?</p>
				<p class="normal">It seems to me that the eu still cannot decide whether it can face the challenges of an emerging new world; whether it is capable of seizing the vast opportunities of encompassing new economic, historical and cultural dimensions; whether it can contribute to the harmonization of civilizations rather than to the professed “clash” of civilizations; whether it will enclose itself within a confined strategic vision and continue to call for a problem-solver from another continent to resolve European problems like Bosnia or Cyprus; whether it exists as an introvert organization or emerge as one which takes responsibility to create a better world for itself and for all. The eu should realize that Turkey contributes to all these causes positively, perhaps decisively.</p>
				<p class="normal">I hope the eu makes the right decision.</p>
				<p class="normal">As for Turkey, I hope as well that the eu does not discriminate against us; that it does not act unjustly by excluding Turkey’s candidacy from its present enlargement process and pre-accession strategy; that it does not cause further resentment in Turkey; that it does not deflate Turkey’s enthusiasm and momentum; that it does not take a course which would damage its relationships with Turkey; that it does not stimulate in Turkey new questions on what our country really means for Western Europe.</p>
				<p class="normal">I have repeated several times that the eu is not an obsession for Turkey. A discriminatory decision by the eu will not mean the end of our country’s horizons, which reach far beyond the eu.</p>
				<p class="normal">But as the Turkish Foreign Minister, I sincerely hope that a positive result comes out of the Luxembourg Summit.</p>
				<p class="normal">The opposite will be insensible. It will be unfair. It will also limit eu’s own horizons.</p>
				<p class="normal">It is still not too late.</p>
