  <body class="calibre2">
<p class="calibre3">Her chest began to pound for air. Again she tried to cough up the lump of half-chewed 
burger and bun in her throat, but it wouldn't come. Now the sound of the wind was bigger 
than the world, bigger than any sound she had ever heard before, and Arnie was finally 
turning away from the hitchhiker to look at her; he was turning in slow motion, his eyes 
widening almost comically, and even his voice seemed too loud, like thunder, the voice of 
Zeus speaking to some poor mortal from behind a massy skystack of thunderclouds: 
'LEIGH . . . ARE YOU . . . WHAT THE HELL? . . . SHE'S CHOKING! OH MY GOD SHE'S 
-' 
He reached for her in slow motion, and then he drew his hands back, immobilized by panic 
(Oh help me help me for God's sake do something I'm dying oh my dear God I'm choking to 
death on a McDonald's hamburger Arnie why don't you HELP ME?) 
and of course she knew why, he drew back because Christine didn't want her to have any 
help, this was Christine's way of getting rid of her, Christine's way of getting rid of the other 
woman, the competition, and now the dashboard instruments really were eyes, great round 
unemotional eyes watching her choke to death, eyes she could only see through a glowing 
jitter of black dots, dots that burst and spread as 
(mamma oh my dear this I'm dying and SHE SEES ME SHE IS ALIVE ALIVE ALIVE OH 
MAMMA MY GOD CHRISTINE IS ALIVE) 
Arnie reached for her again. Now she had begun to thrash on her seat, her chest heaving 
spasmodically as she clawed at her throat. Her eyes were bulging. Her lips had begun to turn 
blue. Arnie was pounding her ineffectually on the back and yelling something. He grabbed 
her shoulder, apparently meaning to pull her out of the car, and then he suddenly winced and 
straightened, his hands going involuntarily to the small of his back. 
Leigh twitched and thrashed. The blockage in her throat felt huge and hot and throbbing. 
She tried again to cough it up, more weakly this time. The lump didn't budge. Now the 
whistle of the wind was beginning to fade, everything was beginning to fade, but her need for 
air didn't seem so awful. Maybe she was dying, but suddenly it didn't seem so bad. Nothing 
was so bad, except for those green eyes staring at her from the instrument panel. They weren't 
unemotional anymore. Now they were blazing with hate and triumph. 
(o my God I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee   I am   for offending   this is my act   
my act of   of) 
Arnie had reached across from the driver's side. Now Leigh's door was suddenly jerked 
open and she spilled sideways into a brutal, cutting cold. The air partially revived her, made 
her struggle for breath seem important again, but the obstruction wouldn't move . . . it just 
wouldn't move. 
From far away, Arnie's voice thundering sternly, the voice of Zeus: 'WHATARE YOU 
DOING? GET YOUR HANDS OFF HER!'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Arms around her. Strong arms. The wind on her face. Snow swirling in her eyes 
(o my God hear me a sinner this is my act of contrition I am heartily sorry for having 
offended   OH!   OWW!   what are you DOING my ribs   hurts   what   what are you) 
and suddenly there were arms around her, crushing, and a pair of hard hands were clasped 
together in a knot just below her breasts, in the hollow of her solar plexus. And suddenly one 
thumb popped up, the thumb of a hitchhiker signalling for a ride, only the thumb drove 
painfully into her breastbone. At the same time the grip of the. arms tightened brutally. She 
felt caught 
(Ohhhhhhh you're breaking my RIBS) 
in a gigantic bearhug. Her whole diaphragm seemed to heave, and something flew out of 
her mouth with the force of a projectile. It landed in the snow: a wet chunk of bun and meat. 
'Let her go!' Arnie was shouting as he slipped and slid around Christine's rear deck to where 
the hitchhiker held Leigh's limp body like a life-sized marionette. 'Let her go, you're killing 
her!' 
Leigh began to breathe in great, tearing gasps. Her throat and lungs seemed to burn in rivers 
of fire with each gulp of the cold, wonderful air. She was dimly aware that she was sobbing. 
The brutal bearhug relaxed and the hands let her go. 'Are you okay, girl? Are you all - ' 
Then Arnie was reaching past her, grabbing for the hitchhiker. He turned toward Arnie, his 
long black hair flying in the wind, and Arnie hit him in the mouth. The hitchhiker flailed 
backward, boots slipping in the snow, and landed on his back. Fresh snow as fine and dry as 
confectioners' sugar puffed up around him. 
Arnie advanced, fists held up, eyes slitted. 
She took another convulsive breath - oh, it hurt, it was like being stabbed with knives - and 
screamed: 'What are you doing, Arnie? Stop it!' 
He turned toward her, dazed. 'Huh? Leigh?' 
'He saved my life, what are you hitting him for?' 
The effort was too much and the black dots began to spiral up before her eyes again. She 
could have leaned against the car, but she didn't want to go near it, didn't want to touch it. 
The dashboard instruments. Something had happened to the dashboard instruments. 
Something 
(eyes they turned into eyes) 
she didn't want, to think about.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">She staggered to a lamppost instead and hung onto it like a drunk, head down, panting. A 
soft, tentative arm went around her waist. 'Leigh . . . honey, are you all right?' She turned her 
head slightly and saw his miserable, scared face. She burst into tears. 
The hitchhiker approached them carefully, wiping his bloody mouth on the sleeve of his 
jacket. 
'Thank you,' Leigh said between harsh, swift breaths. 
The pain was ebbing a trifle now, and the hard, cold wind was soothing on her hot face. 'I 
was choking. I think . . . think I would have died if you hadn't . . .' 
Too much. The black dots again, all sounds fading into an eerie wind-tunnel again. She put 
her head down and waited for it to pass. 
'It's the Heimlich Manoeuvre,' the hitchhiker said. 'They make you learn it when you go to 
work in the cafeteria. At school. Make you practise on a rubber dummy. Daisy Mae, they call 
her. And you do it, but you don't have any idea if it'll - you know - work on a real person or 
not.' His voice was shaky, jumping in pitch from low to high and back to low again like the 
voice of a kid entering puberty. His voice seemed to want to laugh or cry - something - and 
even in the uncertain light and heavily falling snow, Leigh could see how pallid his face was. 
'I never thought I'd actually have to use it. Works pretty good. Did you see that fucking piece 
of meat fly?' The hitchhiker wiped his mouth and looking blankly at the thin froth of blood on 
the palm of his hand. 
'I'm sorry I hit you,' Arnie said. He sounded close to tears. 'I was just . . . I was . . .' 
'Sure, man, I know.' He clapped Arnie on the shoulder. 'No harm, no foul. Girl, are you all 
right?' 
'Yes,' Leigh said. Her breath was coming evenly now. Her heart was slowing down. Only 
her legs were bad; they were so much helpless rubber. My God, she thought. I could be dead 
now. If we hadn't picked that guy up, and we almost didn't - 
It occurred to her that she was lucky to be alive. This clich–π struck her forcibly with a 
stupid, undeniable power that made her feel faint. She began to cry harder. When Arnie led 
her back toward the car, she came with him, her head on his shoulder. 
'Well,' the hitchhiker said uncertainly, 'I'll be off.' 
'Wait,' Leigh said. 'What's your name? You saved my life, I'd like to know your name.' 
'Barry Gottfried,' the hitchhiker said. 'At your service.' Again he swept off an imaginary hat. 
'Leigh Cabot,' she said. 'This is Arnie Cunningham. Thank you again.' 
'For sure,' Arnie added, but Leigh heard no real thanks in his voice - only that shakiness. He 
handed her into the car and suddenly the smell assaulted her, attacked her: nothing mild this 
time, much more than just a whiff underneath. It was the smell of rot and decomposition,</p>
      <p class="calibre3">high and noxious. She felt a mad fright invade her brain and she thought: It is the smell of her 
fury - 
The world slipped sideways in front of her. She leaned out of the car and threw up. 
Then everything there was went grey for a little while. 
* * * * * 
Are you sure you're all right?' Arnie asked her for what seemed to be the hundredth time. It 
would also have to be for one of the last, Leigh realized with some relief. She felt very, very 
tired. There was a dull, throbbing pain in her chest and another one at her temples. 
'I'm fine now.' 
'Good. Good.' 
He moved irresolutely, as if wanting to go but not sure it would be right yet; perhaps not 
until he had asked his seemingly eternal question at least once more. They were standing in 
front of the Cabot house. Oblongs of yellow light spilled from the windows and lay smoothly 
on the fresh and unmarked snow. Christine stood at the curb, idling, showing parking lights. 
'You scared me when you fainted like that,' Arnie said. 
'I didn't faint . . . I only got fogged in for a few minutes.' 
'Well, you scared me. I love you, you know.' 
She looked at him gravel . 'Do you?' 
'Of course I do! Leigh, you know I do!' 
She drew in a deep breath. She was tired, but it had to be said, and said right now. Because 
if she didn't say it now, what had happened would seem completely ridiculous by 
morninglight - or maybe more than ridiculous; by morninglight the idea would likely seen 
mad. A smell that came and went like the 'mouldering stench' in a Gothic horror story? 
Dashboard instruments that turned into eyes? And most of all the insane feeling that the car 
had actually tried to kill her? 
By tomorrow, even the fact that she had almost choked to death would be nothing but a 
vague ache in her chest and the conviction that it had been nothing, really, not a close call at 
all. 
Except it was all true, and Arnie knew it was - yes, some part of him did - and it had to be 
said now. 
'Yes, I think you do love me,' she said slowly. She looked at him steadily. 'But I won't go 
anywhere with you again in that car. And if you really love me, you'll get rid of it.' The 
expression of shock on his face was so large and so sudden that she might have struck him in 
the face.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'What - what are you talking about, Leigh?' 
Was it shock that had caused that slapped expression? Or was some of it guilt? 
'You heard what I said. I don't think you'll get rid of it - I don't know if you even can 
anymore - but if you want to go someplace with me, Arnie, we go on the bus. Or thumb a 
ride. Or fly. But I'm never going to ride in your car again. It's a death-trap.' 
There. She had said it; it was out. 
Now the shock on his face was turning to anger - the blind, obdurate sort of anger she had 
seen on his face so frequently lately. Not just over the big things, but over the little ones as 
well - a woman going through a traffic light on the yellow, a cop who held up traffic just 
before it was their turn to go - but it came to her now with all the force of a revelation that his 
anger, corrosive and so unlike the rest of Arnie's personality, was always associated with the 
car. With Christine. 
‚Äú'If you love me you'll get rid of it,‚Äù' he repeated. 'You know who you sound like?' 
'No, Arnie.' 
'My mother, that's who you sound like.' 
'I'm sorry.' She would not allow herself to be drawn, neither would she defend herself with 
words or end it by just going into the house. She might have been able to if she didn't feel 
anything for him, but she did. Her original impressions - that behind the quiet shyness Arnie 
Cunningham was good and decent and kind (and maybe sexy as well) - had not changed 
much. It was the car, that was all. That was the change. It was like watching a strong mind 
slowly give way under the influence of some evil, corroding, addictive drug. 
Arnie ran his hands through his snow-dusted hair, a characteristic gesture of bewilderment 
and anger. 'You had a bad choking spell in the car, okay, I can understand that you don't feel 
great about it. But it was the hamburger, Leigh, that's all. Or maybe not even that. Maybe you 
were trying to talk while you were chewing or inhaled at just the wrong second or something. 
You might as well blame Ronald McDonald. People choke on their food every now and then 
I that's all. Sometimes they die. You didn't. Thank God for that. But to blame my car - !' 
Yes, it all sounded perfectly plausible. And was. Except that something was going on 
behind Arnie's grey eyes. A frantic something that was not precisely a lie, but . . . 
rationalization? A wilful turning away from the truth? 
'Arnie,' she said, 'I'm tired and my chest hurts and I've got a headache and I think I've only 
got the strength to say this once. Will you listen?' 
'If it's about Christine, you're wasting your breath, he said, and that stubborn, mulish look 
was on his face again. 'It's crazy to blame her and you know it is.'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'Yes, I know it's crazy, and I know I'm wasting my breath,' Leigh said. 'But I'm asking you 
to listen.' 
'I'll listen.' 
She took a deep breath, ignoring the pull in her chest. She looked at Christine, idling a 
plume of white vapour into the thickly falling snow, then looked hastily away. Now it was the 
parking lights that looked like eyes: the yellow eyes of a lynx. 
'When I choked . . . when I was choking . . . the instrument panel. . . the lights on it 
changed. They changed. They were. . . no, I won't go that far, but they looked like eyes.' 
He laughed, a short bark in the cold air. In the house a curtain was pulled aside, someone 
looked out, and then the curtain dropped back again. 
'If that hitchhiker . . . that Gottfried fellow . . . if he hadn't been there, I would have died, 
Arnie. I would have died.' She searched his eyes with her own and pushed ahead. Once, she 
told herself. I only have to say this once. 'You told me that you worked in the cafeteria at 
LHS your first three years. I've seen the Heimlich Manoeuvre poster on the door to the 
kitchen. You must have seen it too. But you didn't try that on me, Arnie. You were getting 
ready to clap me on the back. That doesn't work. I had a job in a restaurant back in 
Massachusetts, and the first thing they teach you, even before they teach you the Heimlich 
Manoeuvre, is that clapping a choking victim on the back doesn't work.' 
'What are you saying?' he asked in a thin, out-of-breath voice. 
She didn't answer; only looked at him. He met her gaze for only a moment, and then his 
eyes - angry, confused, almost haunted - shifted away. 
'Leigh, people forget things. You're right, I should have used it. But if you had the course, 
you know you can use it on yourself.' Arnie laced his hands together into a fist with one 
thumb sticking up and pressed against his diaphragm to demonstrate. 'It's just that in the heat 
of the moment, people forget - ' 
'Yes, they do. And you seem to forget a lot of things in that car. Like how to be Arnie 
Cunningham.' 
Arnie was shaking his head. 'You need time to think this over, Leigh. You need - ' 
'That is just what I don't need!' she said with a fierceness she wouldn't have believed she 
still had left in her. 'I never had a supernatural experience in my life - I never even believed in 
stuff like that - but now I wonder just what's going on and what's happening to you. They 
looked like eyes, Arnie. And later . . . afterward . . . there was a smell, A horrible, rotten 
smell.' 
He recoiled. 
'You know what I'm talking about.'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">No. I don't have the slightest idea.' 
'You just jumped as if the devil had twisted your ear.' 
'You're imagining things,' Arnie said hotly. 'A lot of things.' 
'That smell was there. And there are other things as well. Sometimes your radio won't get 
anything but that oldies station - ' 
Another flicker in his eyes, and a slight twitch at the left corner of his mouth. 
'And sometimes when we're making out it just stalls, as if it didn't like it. As if the car didn't 
like it, Arnie.' 
'You're upset,' he said with ominous flatness. 
'Yes, I am upset I she said, beginning to cry. 'Aren't you?' The tears trickled slowly down 
her cheeks. I think this is the end of it for us, Arnie - I loved you, but I think it's over. I really 
think it is, and that makes me feel so sad, and so sorry. 'Your relationship with your parents 
has turned into a . . . an armed camp, you're running God knows what into New York and 
Vermont for that fat pig Will Darnell, and that car . . . that car . . . ' 
She could not say anything more. Her voice dissolved. She dropped her packages and bent 
blindly to pick them up. Exhausted and weeping, she succeeded in doing little more than 
stirring them around. He bent to help her and she pushed at him roughly. 'Leave them alone! 
I'll get them!' 
He stood up, his face pale and set. His expression was one of wooden fury, but his eyes . . . 
oh, to Leigh his eyes seemed lost. 
'All right,' he said, and now his voice roughened with his own tears. 'Good. Join up with the 
rest of them if you want. You just saddle up and ride right along with all those other shitters. 
Who gives a tin shit?' He drew in a shivering breath, and a single hurt sob escaped him before 
he could clap a gloved hand brutally over his mouth. 
He began to walk backward toward the car; he reached out blindly behind himself for the 
Plymouth and Christine was there. 'Just as long as you know you're crazy. Right out of your 
mind! So go on and play you! I don't need any of you!' 
His voice rose to a thin scream, in devilish harmony with the wind: 
'I don't need you so fuck off!' 
He rushed around to the driver's side, his feet slid and he grabbed for Christine. She was 
there and he didn't fall. He got in, the engine revved, the headlights came on in a huge white 
glare, and the Fury pulled out, rear tyres spinning up a fog of snow.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Now the tears came fast and hard as she stood watching, the tail-lights fade to round red 
periods and wink out as the car went around the corner. Her packages lay scattered at her 
feet. 
And then, suddenly, her mother was there, absurdly clothed in an open raincoat, green 
rubber boots, and her blue flannel nightgown. 
'Honey, what's wrong?' 
'Nothing,' Leigh sobbed. 
I almost choked to death, I smelled something that might have come from a freshly opened 
tomb, and I think . . . yes, I think that somehow that car is alive . . . more alive every day. I 
think it's like some kind of horrible vampire, only it's taking Arnie's mind to feed itself. His 
mind and his spirit. 
'Nothing, nothing's wrong, I had a fight with Arnie, that's all. Help me pick up my things, 
would you?' 
They picked up Leigh's parcels and went in. The door shut behind them and the night 
belonged to the wind and to the swiftly falling snow. By morning there would be better than 
eight inches. 
* * * * * 
Arnie cruised until sometime after midnight, and later had no memory of it. The snow had 
filled the streets; they were deserted and ghostly. It was not a night for the great American 
motor-car. Nevertheless, Christine moved through the deepening storm with surefooted ease, 
even without snow tyres. Now and then the prehistoric shape of a snowplough loomed and 
was gone. 
The radio played. It was WDIL all the way across the dial. The news came on. Eisenhower 
had predicted, at the AFL-CIO convention, a future of labour and management marching 
harmoniously into the future together. Dave Beck had denied that the Teamsters Union was a 
front for the rackets. Rock 'n roller Eddie Cochran had been killed in a car crash while en 
route to London's Heathrow Airport: three hours of emergency surgery had failed to save his 
life. The Russians were rattling their ICBMS. WDIL played the oldies all week long, but on 
the weekends they really got dedicated. Fifties newscasts, wow. That was 
(never heard anything like that before) 
a really neat idea. That was 
(totally insane) 
pretty neat. 
The weather promised more snow.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Then music again: Bobby Darin singing 'Splish-Splash', Ernie K-Doe singing 'Mother-in-
Law', the Kalin twins singing 'When'. The wipers beat time. 
He looked to his right, and Roland D. LeBay was riding shotgun. 
Roland D. LeBay sat there in his green pants and a faded shirt of Army twill, looking out of 
dark eyesockets. A beetle sat, preening, within one. 
You have to make them pay, Roland D. LeBay said. You have to make the shitters pay, 
Cunningham. Every last fucking one of them. 
'Yes,' Arnie whispered. Christine hummed through the night, cutting the snow with fresh, 
sure tracks. 'Yes, that's a fact.' And the wipers nodded back and forth.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">35   NOW THIS BRIEF                                                                   
INTERLUDE 
 
Drive that old Chrysler to Mexico, boy.

At Libertyville High, Coach Puffer bad given way to Coach Jones, and football had given 
way to basketball. But nothing really changed: the LHS cagers didn't do much better than the 
LHS gridiron warriors - the only bright spot was Lenny Barongg, a three-sport man whose 
major one was basketball. Lenny stubbornly went about having the great year he needed to 
get the athletic scholarship to Marquette that he lusted after. 
Sandy Galton suddenly blew town. One day he was there, the next he was gone. His 
mother, a fortv-five-year old wino who didn't look a day over sixty, did not seem terribly 
concerned. Neither did his younger brother, who pushed more dope than any other kid in 
Gornick Junior High. A romantic rumour that he had cut out for Mexico made the rounds at 
Libertyville High. Another, less romantic, rumour also made the rounds: that Buddy 
Repperton had been on Sandy about something and he felt it would be safer to make himself 
scarce. 
The Christmas break approached and the school's atmosphere grew restless and rather 
thundery, as it always did before a long vacation. The student body's overall grade average 
took its customary pre-Christmas dip. Book reports were turned in late and often bore a 
suspicious resemblance to jacket copy (after all, how many sophomore English students are 
apt to call The Catcher in the Rye 'this burning classic of postwar adolescence'?). Class 
projects were left half done or undone, the percentage of detention periods given for kissing 
and petting in the halls skyrocketed, and busts for marijuana went way up as the Libertyville 
High School students indulged in a little pre-Christmas cheer. So a good many of the students 
were up; teacher absenteeism was up; in the hallways and homerooms, Christmas decorations 
were up. 
Leigh Cabot was not up. She flunked an exam for the first time in her high school career 
and got a D on an executive typing drill. She could not seem to study, she found her mind 
wandering back, again and again, to Christine - to the green dashboard instruments that had 
become hateful, gloating cat's-eyes, watching her choke to death. 
But for most, the last week of school before the Christmas break was a mellow period when 
offences which would have earned detention slips at other times of the year were excused, 
when hard-hearted teachers would sometimes actually throw a scale on an exam where 
everyone had done badly, when girls who had been bitter enemies made it up, and when boys 
who had scuffled repeatedly over real or imagined insults did the same. Perhaps more</p>
      <p class="calibre3">indicative of the mellow season than anything else was the fact that Miss Rat-Pack, the 
gorgon of Room 23 study hall, was seen to smile . . . not just once, but several times. 
In the hospital, Dennis Guilder was moderately up - he had swapped his bedfast traction 
casts for walking casts. Physical therapy was no longer the torture it had been. He swung 
through corridors that had been strung with tinsel and decorated with first-, second-, and 
third-grade Christmas pictures, his crutches thump-thumping along, sometimes in time to the 
carols spilling merrily from the overhead speakers. 
It was a caesura, a lull, an interlude, a period of quiet. During his seemingly endless walks 
up and down the hospital corridors, Dennis reflected that things could be worse - much, much 
worse. 
Before too long, they were.</p>

Something bad is gonna happen to me . . . 
                              - The Inmates 
 
On Tuesday, December 12, the Terriers lost to the Buccaneers 54-48 in the Libertyville 
High gym. Most of the fans went out into the still black cold of the night not too 
disappointed: every sportswriter in the Pittsburgh area had predicted another loss for the 
Terriers. The result could hardly be called an upset. And there was Lenny Barongg for the 
Terriers fans to be proud of: he scored a mind-boggling 34 points all by himself, setting a 
new school record. 
Buddy Repperton, however, was disappointed. 
Because he was, Richie Trelawney was also at great pains to be disappointed. So was 
Bobby Stanton in the back seat. 
In the few months since he had been ushered out of LHS, Buddy seemed to have aged. Part 
of it was the beard. He looked less like Clint Eastwood and more like some hard-drinking 
young actor's version of Captain Ahab. Buddy had been doing a lot of drinking these last few 
weeks. He had been having dreams so terrible he could barely remember them. He awoke 
sweaty and trembling, feeling he had barely escaped some awful doom that ran dark and 
quiet. 
The booze cut them off, though. Cut them right off at the fucking knees. Goddam right. 
Working nights and sleeping days, that's all it was. 
He unrolled the window of his scuffed and dented Camaro, scooping in frigid air, and 
tossed out an empty bottle. He reached back over his shoulder and said, 'Another Molotov 
cocktail, mess-sewer.' 
'Right on, Buddy,' Bobby Stanton said respectfully, and slapped another bottle of Texas 
Driver into Buddy's hand. Buddy had treated them to a case of the stuff - enough to paralyse 
the entire Egyptian Navy, he said - after the game. 
He spun off the cap, steering momentarily with his elbows, and then gulped down half the 
bottle. He handed it to Richie and uttered a long, froggy belch. The Camaro's headlights cut 
Route 46, running northeast as straight as a string through rural Pennsylvania. Snow-covered</p>
      <p class="calibre3">fields lay dreaming on either side of the road, twinkling in a billion points of light that mimed 
the stars in the black winter sky. He was headed - in a sort of casual, half-drunk way - for 
Squantic Hills. Another destination might take his fancy in the meantime, but if not, the Hills 
were a fine and private place to get high in peace. 
Richie passed the bottle back to Bobby again, who drank big even though he hated the taste 
of Texas Driver. He supposed that when he got a little drunker, he wouldn't mind the taste at 
all. He might be hung over and puking tomorrow, but tomorrow was a thousand years away. 
Bobby was still excited just to be with them; he was only a freshman, and Buddy Repperton, 
with his near-mythic reputation for bigness and badness, was a figure he viewed with mixed 
fear and awe. 
'Fucking clowns,' Buddy said morosely. 'What a bunch of fucking clowns. You call that a 
basketball game?' 
'All a bunch of retards,' Richie agreed. 'Except for Barongg. Thirty-four points, not too 
tacky.' 
'I hate that fucking spade,' Buddy said, giving Richie a long, measuring, drunken look. 'You 
taking up for that jungle bunny?' 
'No way, Buddy,' Richie said promptly. 
'Better not. I'll Barongg him.' 
'Which do you want first?' Bobby asked abruptly from the back seat. 'The good news or the 
bad news?' 
'Bad news first,' Buddy said. He was into his third bottle of Driver now and feeling no pain 
- only an aggrieved anger. He had forgotten - at least for the moment - that he had been 
expelled; he was concentrating only on the fact that the old school team, that bunch of 
fucking retard assholes, had let him down. 'Always bad news first.' The Camaro rolled 
northeast at sixty-five over two-lane tar that was like a swipe of black paint across a hilly 
white floor. The land had begun to rise slightly as they approached Squantic Hills. 
'Well, the bad news is that a million Martians just landed in New York,' Bobby said. 'Now 
you wanna hear the good news?' 
'There is no good news,' Buddy said in a low, morose, grieving voice. Richie would have 
liked to tell the kid you didn't try to cheer Buddy up when he was in a mood like this; that 
only made it worse. The thing to do was to let it run its course. 
Buddy had been this way ever since Moochie Welch, that little four-eyes panhandling dork, 
got run down by some psycho on JFK Drive. 
'The good news is that they eat niggers and piss gasoline,' Bobby said, and roared with 
laughter. He laughed for quite a while before he realized he was laughing alone. Then he shut 
up quickly. He glanced up and saw Buddy's bloodshot eyes looking at him over the</p>
      <p class="calibre3">uppermost tendrils of his beard, and that red, ferrety gaze in the rearview mirror gave him an 
unpleasant thrill of fear. It occurred to Bobby Stanton that he might have shut up a minute or 
two too late. 
Behind them, distant, perhaps as much as three miles back, headlights twinkled like 
insignificant yellow sparks in the night, 
'You think that's funny?' Buddy asked. 'You tell a fucking racist joke like that and you think 
it's funny? You're a fucking bigot, you know that?' 
Bobby's mouth dropped open. 'But you said 
'I said I didn't like Barongg. In general I think spades are as good as white people.' 
Buddy considered. 
'Well, almost as good.' 
'But - ' 
'You want to watch out or you'll be walking home,' Buddy snarled. 'With a rupture. Then 
you can write I HATE NIGGERS all over your fuckin truss.' 
'Oh,' Bobby said in a small, scared voice. He felt as if he had reached up to turn on a light 
and had got a whopper of an electric shock. 'Sorry.' 
'Give me that bottle and shut your head.' 
Bobby handed the Driver up front with alacrity. His hand was shaking. 
Buddy killed the bottle. They passed a sign which read SQUANTIC HILLS STATE PARK 3 
MI. The lake at the centre of the state park was a popular beach area in the summertime, but 
the park was closed from November to April. The road which wound through the park to 
Squantic Lake was kept ploughed for periodic National Guard manoeuvres and winter 
Explorer Scouts camping trips, however, and Buddy had discovered a side entrance which 
went around the main gate and then joined the park road. Buddy liked to go into the silent, 
wintry state park and cruise and drink. 
Behind them, the distant twin sparks had grown to circles - dual headlights about a mile 
back. 
'Hand me another Molotov cocktail, you fucking racist pig.' 
Bobby handed up a fresh bottle of Driver, remaining prudently silent. 
Buddy drank deeply, belched, and then handed the bottle across to Richie. 
'No thanks, man.' 
"You drink it, or you may find yourself getting an enema with it.'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'Sure, okay,' Richie said, wishing mightily that he had stayed home tonight. He drank. 
The Camaro sped along, its headlights cutting the night. Buddy glanced into the rearview 
and saw the other car. It was now coming up fast. He glanced at his speedometer and saw he 
was doing sixty-five. The car behind them had to be doing close to seventy. Buddy felt 
something - a curious kind of doubling back to the dreams he could not quite remember. A 
cold finger seemed to press lightly against his heart. 
Ahead, the road branched in two, Route 46 continuing east toward New Stanton, the other 
road bearing north toward Squantic Hills State Park. A large orange sign advised: CLOSED 
WINTER MONTHS. 
Barely slowing, Buddy dragged left and shot up the hill. The approach road to the park was 
not so well-ploughed, and overarching trees had kept the warm afternoon sun from melting 
off the snowpack. The Camaro slid a little before grabbing the road again. In the back seat, 
Bobby Stanton made a low, uneasy sound. 
Buddy looked up in the rearview, expecting to see the other car shoot by along 46 - after 
all, there was nothing up this road but a dead end as far as most drivers were concerned - but 
instead it took the turn eyen faster than Buddy had and pounded along after them, now less 
than a quarter of a mile behind. Its headlights were four glowing white circles that washed the 
Camaro's interior. 
Bobby and Richie turned around to look. 
'What the fuck?' Richie muttered. 
But Buddy knew. Suddenly he knew. It was the car that had run down Moochie. Oh yes it 
was. The psycho who had greased Moochie was behind the wheel of that car, and now he was 
after Buddy. 
He stepped down on the go, and the Camaro started to fly. The speedometer needle crept up 
to seventy and then gradually heeled over toward eighty. Trees blurred past, dark sketches in 
the night. The lights behind them did not fall back; the truth was that they were still gaining. 
The duals had merged into two great white eyes. 
'Man I you want to slow down,' Richie said. He grabbed for his seatbelt, actively scared 
now. 'If we roll at this speed - ' 
Buddy didn't answer. He hunched over the wheel, alternating glances at the road ahead with 
glances shot into the rearview mirror, where those lights grew and grew. 
'The road curves up ahead,' Bobby said hoarsely. And as the curve approached, guardrail 
reflectors flickering chrome in the Camaro's headlights, he screamed it: 'Buddy! It curves! It 
curves!' 
Buddy changed down to second gear and the Camaro's engine bellowed its protest. The 
tachometer needle hit 6,000 rpm, danced briefly at redline-7,000, and then dropped back to a</p>
      <p class="calibre3">more normal range. Backfires blatted through the Camaro's exhaust pipes like machine-gun 
fire. Buddy pulled the wheel over, and the car floated into the sharp bend. The rear wheels 
skimmed over hard-packed snow. At the last possible instant he shifted back up, tramped on 
the accelerator pedal, and let his body sway freely as the Camaro's left rear end slammed into 
the snowbanks digging a coffin-sized divot and then bouncing off. The Camaro slewed the 
other way. He went with it, then goosed the accelerator again. For one moment he thought it 
would not respond, that the skid would continue and they would simply barrel sideways up 
the road at seventy-five until they hit a bare patch and flipped over. 
But the Camaro straightened out. 
'Holy Jesus Buddy slow down!' Richie wailed. 
Buddy hung over the wheel, grinning through his beard, bloodshot eyes bulging. The bottle 
of Driver was clamped between his legs. There! There, you crazy murdering sonofabitch. 
Let's see you do that without rolling it over! .  
A moment later the headlights reappeared, closer than ever, Buddy's grin faltered and 
faded. For the first time he felt a sickish, unmanning tingle running up his legs toward his 
crotch, Fear - real fear - stole into him. 
Bobby had been looking behind as the car chased them round the bedd, and now he turned 
around, his face slack and cheesy. 'It dint even skid,' he said. 'But that's impossible! That's - ' 
'Buddy, who is it?' Richie asked. 
He reached out to touch Buddy's elbow, and his hand was flung away with such force that 
his knuckles cracked on the glass of his window. 
'You don't want to touch me,' Buddy whispered. The road rolled straight in front of him, not 
black tar now but white snow, packed and treacherous. The Camaro was rolling over this 
greasy surface at better than ninety miles an hour, only its roof and the orange Ping-Pong ball 
jammed on the top of its radio aerial visible between chest-high embankments. 'You don't 
want to touch me, Richie. Not going this fast.' 
'Is it -' Richie's voice cracked and he couldn't go on. 
Buddy spared him a glance, and at the sight of the fear in Buddy's small red eyes, Richie's 
own terror came up in his throat like hot, smooth oil. 
'Yeah,' Buddy said. 'I think it is.' 
No houses up here; they were already on state land. Nothing up here but the high snow 
embankments and the dark interlacing of trees. 
'It's gonna bump us!' Bobby screeched from the back seat. His voice was as high as an old 
woman's. Between his feet the remaining bottles of Texas Driver chattered wildly in their 
carton. 'Buddy! It's gonna bump us!'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">The car behind them had come to within five feet of the Camaro's back bumper; its high 
beams flooded the car with light bright enough to read fine print. It slipped forward even 
closer. A moment later there was a thud. 
The Camaro shifted its stance on the road as the car behind them fell back a trifle; to Buddy 
it was as if they were suddenly floating, and he knew they were a hair's breadth from going 
into a wild, looping skid, the front end and the rear briskly swapping places until they hit 
something and rolled. 
A droplet of sweat, as warm and stinging as a tear, ran into his eye. 
Gradually, the Camaro straightened out again. 
When he felt that he had control, Buddy let his right foot smoothly depress the accelerator 
all the way. If it was Cunningham in that old rustbucket '58 - ah, and hadn't that been part of 
the dreams he could barely remember - the Camaro would shut him down. 
The engine was now screaming. The tach needle was again on the edge of the redline at 
7,000 rpm. The speedometer had passed the one hundred post, and the snowbanks streamed 
past them on either side in ghastly silence. The road ahead looked like a point-of-view shot in 
a film that had been insanely speeded up. 
'Oh dear God,' Bobby babbled, 'oh dear God please don't let me get killed oh dear God oh 
holy shit - ' 
He wasn't there the night we trashed Cuntface's car, Buddy thought. He doesn't know 
what's going on. Poor busted-luck sonofawhore. He did not really feel sorry for Bobby, but if 
he could have been sorry for anyone, it would have been for the little shit-for-brains 
freshman. On his right, Richie Trelawney sat bolt-upright and as pallid as a gravestone, his 
eyes eating up his face. Richie knew the score, all right. 
The car whispered toward them, headlights swelling in the rearview mirror. 
He can't be gaining! Buddy's mind screamed. He can't be! But the car behind them was 
indeed gaining, and Buddy sensed it was boring in for the kill. His mind ran like a rat in a 
cage, looking for a way out, and there was none. The slot in the left snowbank that marked 
the little side-road he usually used to bypass the gate and get into the state park had already 
flashed by. He was running out of time, room, and options. 
There was another soft bump, and again the Camaro slewed - this, time at something over a 
hundred and ten miles an hour. No hope, man, Buddy thought fatalistically. He took his hands 
off the wheel altogether and grabbed his seatbelt. For the first time in his life, he snapped it 
shut across his waist. 
At the same time, Bobby Stanton in the back seat screamed in a shrill ecstasy of fear: 'The 
gate, man! Oh Jesus Buddy it's the gaaaaayyyyy - '</p>
      <p class="calibre3">The Camaro had breasted a final steep hill. The far side sloped down to a place where the 
road branched in two, becoming the entrance and exit from the state park. Between the two 
ways stood a small gatehouse on a concrete island - in the summertime, a lady sat in there on 
a camp chair and took a buck from each car that entered the park. 
Now the gatehouse was flooded with ghastly light as the two cars raced down toward it, the 
Camaro heeling steadily to port as the skid worsened. 
'Fuck you, Cuntface!' Buddy screamed. 'Fuck you and the horse you rode in on!' He yanked 
the wheel all the way around, twirling it with the death-knob that held one bobbing red die in 
alcohol. 
Bobby screamed again. Richie Trelawney clapped his hands over his face, his last thought 
on earth a constant repetition of Watch out for broken glass watch out for broken glass watch 
out for broken glass - 
The Camaro swapped ends, and now the headlights of the car following blared directly into 
them, and Buddy began to scream because it was Cuntface's car, all right, that grille was 
impossible to mistake, it seemed at least a mile wide, only there was no one behind the wheel. 
The car was totally empty. 
In the last two seconds before impact, Christine's headlights shifted away to what was now 
Buddy's left. The Fury shot into the entrance roadway as neatly and exactly as a bullet shoots 
down a rifle barrel. It snapped off the wooden barrier and sent it flying end over end into the 
black night, round yellow reflectors flashing. 
Buddy Repperton's Camaro rammed ass-backwards into the concrete island where the 
gatehouse stood. The eight-inch concrete lip peeled off everything bolted to the lower deck, 
leaving the twisted wreckage of the exhaust pipes and the silencer sitting on the snow like 
some weird sculpture. The Camaro's rear end was first accordioned and then demolished. 
Bobby Stanton was demolished along with it. Buddy was dimly aware of something hitting 
his back like a bucket of warm water. It was Bobby Stanton's blood. 
The Camaro flipped into the air end for end, a mangled projectile in a squall of flying 
splinters and shattered boards, one headlight still glaring maniacally. It did a complete three-
sixty and came down with a glass-jangling thud and rolled over. The firewall ruptured and the 
engine slid backward, at an angle crushing Richie Trelawney from the waist down. There was 
a coughing explosion of fire from the ruptured gas tank as the Camaro came to rest. 
Buddy Repperton was alive. He had been cut in several places by flying glass - one ear had 
been clipped off with surgical neatness, leaving a red hole on the left side of his head - and 
his leg had been broken, but he was alive. His seatbelt had saved him. He thumbed the catch 
and it let go. The crackle of fire was like someone crumpling paper. He could feel the baking 
heat. 
He tried to open the door, but the door was crimped shut.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Panting hoarsely, he threw himself through the empty space where the windscreen had been 
- 
- and there was Christine. 
She stood forty yards away, facing him at the end of a long, slewing skidmark. The rumble 
of her engine was like the slow panting of some gigantic animal. 
Buddy licked his lips. Something in his left side pulled and jabbed with every breath. 
Something busted in there, too. Ribs. 
Christine's engine gunned and fell off; gunned and fell off. Faintly, like something from a 
lunatic's nightmare, he could hear Elvis Presley singing 'Jailhouse Rock'. 
Orange-pink points of light on the snow. The rumbling whoosh of fire. It was going to 
blow. It was - 
It did blow. The Camaro's gas tank went with a hard thudding noise. Buddy felt a rude hand 
shove him in the back, and he flew through the air and landed in the snow on his hurt slide. 
His jacket was flaming. He grunted and rolled in the snow, putting himself out. Then he tried 
to get to his knees. Behind him, the Camaro was a blazing pyre in the night. 
Christine's engine, revving and falling off, revving and falling off, now more quickly, more 
urgently. 
Buddy finally managed to get to his hands and knees. He peered at Cunningham's Plymouth 
through the sweaty tangles of hair hanging in his eyes. The hood had been crimped up when 
the Plymouth blasted through the barrier arm, and the radiator was dripping a mixture of 
water and antifreeze that steamed on the snow like fresh animal spoor. 
Buddy licked his lips again. They felt as dry as lizard skin. His back felt warm, as if he had 
gotten a moderately bad sunburn; he could smell smoking cloth, but in the extremity of his 
shock he was unaware that both his parka and the two shirts beneath had been burned away. 
'Listen,' he said, hardly aware he was speaking. 'Listen hey - ' 
Christine's engine screamed and she came at him, rear end flirting back and forth as her 
tyres spun through the sugary snow. The crimped hood was like a mouth in a frozen snarl. 
Buddy waited on his hands and knees, resisting the overpowering urge to leap and scramble 
away at once, resisting as much as he could - the wild panic that was ripping away his self-
control. No one in the car. A more imaginative person would already have gone mad, 
perhaps. 
At the last possible second he rolled to the left, screaming as the splintered ends of the 
broken bone in his leg ground together. He felt something bullet past him inches away, there 
was warm, foul-smelling exhaust in his face for a moment, and then the snow was red as 
Christine's tail-lights flashed.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">She wheeled, skidding, and came back at him 
'No!' Buddy screamed. Pain lanced at his chest. 'No! No! N - ' 
He leaped, blind reflexes taking over, and this time the bullet was closer, clipping leather 
off one shoe and turning his left foot instantly numb. He turned crazily on his hands and 
knees, like a small child playing I Witness at a birthday party. Blood from his mouth now 
mixed with the snot running freely from his nose; one of his broken ribs had nicked a lung. 
Blood ran down his cheek from the hole in his head where his ear had been. Frosty air jetted 
from his nose. His breath came in whistling sobs. 
Christine paused. 
White vapour drifted from her exhaust; her engine throbbed and purred. The windscreen 
was a black blank. 
Behind Buddy, the remains of the Camaro shot greasy flames at the sky. A razor-sharp 
wind fluttered and fanned them. Bobby Stanton sat in the inferno of the back seat, his head 
cocked, a grin locked onto his blackening features. 
Playing with me, Buddy thought. Playing with me, that's what it's doing. Like a cat with a 
mouse. 
'Please,' he croaked. The headlights were blinding, turning the blood dripping down his 
cheek and from the sides of his mouth to an insectile black. 'Please . . . I . . . I'll tell him I'm 
sorry . . . I'll crawl to him on my fucking hands and knees if that's what you want . . . only 
please . . . pl - 
The engine screamed. Christine leaped at him like old doom from a dark age. Buddy 
howled and lunged aside again, and this time the bumper struck his shin and broke his other 
leg and threw him toward the embankment at the side of the park road. He hit and sprawled 
like a loose bag of grain. 
Christine wheeled back toward him, but Buddy bad seen a chance, one thin chance. He 
began to scramble wildly up the embankment, digging into the snow with bare hands from 
which the feeling had already departed, digging with his feet, ignoring the tremendous clouts 
of pain from his shattered legs. Now his breath came in little screams as the headlights grew 
brighter and the engine louder; every clod of snow threw its own jagged black shadow and he 
could feel it, he could feel it behind him like some horrible man-eating tiger - 
There was a crunch and jangle of metal, and Buddy cried out as one of his feet was driven 
into the snow by Christine's bumper. He yanked it out of the snow, leaving his shoe wedged 
deep. 
Lying, gibbering, crying, Buddy gained the top of the bank thrown up by some National 
Guard Motor Pool plough days ago, tottered on the edge of balance there, pinwheeled his 
arms, and barely kept from rolling back down.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">He turned to face Christine, The Plymouth had reversed across the road and now came 
forward again, rear tyres spinning, digging at the snow. It crashed into the bank a foot below 
where Buddy was perched, making him sway and sending down a further avalanche of snow. 
The hit crimped her hood in further, but Buddy was not touched. She reversed again through 
a mist of churned-up snow, engine now seeming to howl with frustrated anger. 
Buddy screamed in triumph and shook his middle finger at her. 'Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck 
you!' A spray of mixed blood and spittle flew from his lips. With each gasping breath, the 
pain seemed to sink deeper into his left side, numbing and paralyzing. 
Christine roared forward and slammed into the embankment again. 
This time a large section of the bank, loosened in the car's first charge, came sliding down, 
burying Christine's wrinkled, snarling snout, and Buddy almost came down with it. He saved 
himself only by skittering backward rapidly, sliding on his butt and pulling himself with 
hands that were clawed into the snow like bloody grappling hooks. His legs were in agony 
now, and he flopped over on his side, gasping like a beached fish. 
Christine came again. 
'Get outta here!' Buddy cried. 'Get outta here, you crazy WHORE!' 
She slammed into the embankment again, and this time enough snow fell to douse her hood 
to the windscreen. The wipers came on and began to arc back and forth, flicking melting 
snow away. 
She reversed again, and Buddy saw that one more hit would sent him cascading down onto 
Christine's hood with the snow. He let himself fall over backward and went rolling down the 
far side of the embankment, screaming each time his broken ribs bumped the ground. He 
came to rest in loose powder, staring up at black sky, the cold stars. His teeth began to click 
helplessly together. Shudders raced through his body. 
Christine didn't come again, but he could hear the soft mutter of her engine. Not coming, 
but waiting. 
He glanced at the snowbank bulking against the sky. Beyond it, the glow of the burning 
Camaro had begun to wane a bit. How long had it been since the crash? He didn't know. 
Would anyone see the fire and come to rescue him? He didn't know that either. 
Buddy became aware of two things simultaneously: that blood was flowing from his mouth 
- flowing at a frightening rate - and that he was very cold. He would freeze to death if 
someone didn't come. 
Frightened all over again, he struggled and thrashed his way into a sitting position. He was 
trying to decide if he could worm his way back up and watch the car - it was worse, not being 
able to see it - when he glanced up at the embankment again. His breath snagged and stopped. 
A man was standing there.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Only it wasn't a man at all; it was a corpse. A rotting corpse in green pants. It was shirtless, 
but a back brace splotched with grey mould was cinched around its blackening torso. White 
bone gleamed through the skin stretched across its face. 
'That's it for you, you shitter,' this starlit apparition whispered. 
The last of Buddy's control broke and he began to scream hysterically, his eyes bulging, his 
long hair seeming to puff into a grotesque helmet around his bloody, soot-smudged face as 
the root of each strand stiffened and stood on end. Blood poured from his mouth in freshets 
and drenched the collar of his parka; he tried to skid backward, hooking into the snow with 
his hands again and sliding his buttocks as the thing came toward him. It had no eyes. Its eyes 
were gone, eaten out of its face by God knew what squirming things. And he could smell it, 
oh God he could smell it and the smell was like rotting tomatoes, the smell was death. 
The corpse of Roland D. LeBay held out its decayed hands to Buddy Repperton and 
grinned. 
Buddy screamed. Buddy howled. And suddenly he stiffened, his lips forming an O of 
perfect finality, puckered as if he wished to kiss the horror shambling toward him. His hands 
scratched and scrabbled at the left side of his shredded parka above his heart, which had 
finally been punctured by the jagged stub of a splintered rib. He fell backward feet kicking 
groove in the snow, his final breath slipping out in a long white jet from his slack mouth . . . 
like auto exhaust. 
On the embankment, the thing he had seen flickered and was gone. There were no tracks. 
From the far side, Christine's engine cranked up into an exhaust-crackling bellow of 
triumph that struck the frowning, snow-covered uplands of Squantic Hills and then echoed 
back. 
On the far verge of Squantic Lake, some ten miles away as the crow flies, a young man 
who had gone out for a cross-country ski by starlight heard the sound and suddenly stopped, 
his hands on his poles and his head cocked. 
Abruptly the skin on his back prickled into bumps, as if a goose had just walked over his 
grave, and although he knew it was only a car somewhere on the other side - sound carried a 
long way up here on still winter nights - his first thought was that something prehistoric had 
awakened and had tracked its prey to earth: a great wolf, or perhaps a sabre-toothed tiger. 
The sound was not repeated and he went on his way.</p>

Tell me: Just how do you feel? 
                                - Chester Burnett 
 
Will Darnell was at the garage until after midnight on the night Buddy Repperton and his 
friends met Christine in Squantic Hills. His emphysema had been particularly bad that day. 
When it got bad, he was afraid to lie down, although he was ordinarily a perfect bear for 
sleep. 
The doctor told him it was not at all likely he would choke to death in his sleep, but as he 
got older and the emphysema slowly tightened its grip on his lungs, he feared it more and 
more. The fact that his fear was irrational didn't change it in the least. Although he hadn't 
been inside a church of any faith since he had been twelve years old - forty-nine years ago 
now! - he had been morbidly interested in the circumstances surrounding the death of Pope 
John Paul I ten weeks before. John Paul had died in bed and had been found there in the 
morning. Already stiffening probably. That was the part that haunted Will: Already stiffening, 
probably. 
He pulled into the garage at half-past nine, driving his 1966 Chrysler Imperial - the last car 
he intended ever to own. At about the same time Buddy Repperton was noticing the twin 
sparks of distant headlights in his rearview mirror. 
Will was worth better than two million dollars, but money didn't give him much pleasure 
anymore, if indeed it ever had. The money didn't even seem completely real anymore. 
Nothing did, except the emphysema. That was hideously real, and Will welcomed anything 
that took his mind off it. 
The problem of Arnie Cunningham, now - that had taken his mind off his emphysema. He 
supposed that was why he had let Cunningham hang around the place when all of his 
strongest- instincts told him to get the kid out of the garage, he was in some way dangerous. 
Something was going on with Cunningham and his rebuilt '58. Something very peculiar. 
The kid wasn't in tonight; he and the entire LHS chess club were in Philadelphia for three 
days at the Northern States Fall Tourney. Cunningham had laughed about that; he was much 
changed from the pimply, big-eyed kid that Buddy Repperton had jumped on, the kid Will 
had immediately (and erroneously) dismissed as a crybaby jellyfish and maybe a goddam 
queer in the bargain.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">For one thing, he had grown cynical. 
He had told Will in the office yesterday afternoon over cigars (the boy had developed a 
taste for those as well; Will doubted if his parents knew) that he had missed so many chess 
club meetings that according to the by-laws, he was no longer a member. Slawson, the faculty 
advisor, knew it but was conveniently overlooking it until after the Northern States Tourney. 
'I've missed more meetings than anyone, but I also happen to play better than anyone else, 
and the shitter knows - ' Arnie winced and shoved both hands into the small of his back for a 
moment. 
'You ought to get a doctor to look at that,' Will remarked. 
Arnie winked, suddenly looking much older than nearly eighteen. 'I don't need anything but 
a good Christian fuck to stretch the vertebrae.' 
'So you're going to Philly?' Will had been disappointed, even though Cunningham had the 
off-time coming; it meant he would have to put Jimmy Sykes in charge for the next couple of 
nights, and Jimmy didn't know his ass from ice cream. 
'Sure. I'm not about to turn down three days of bright lights,' Arnie said. He saw Will's sour 
face and had grinned. 'Don't worry, man. This close to Christmas, all your regulars are buying 
toys for the kiddies instead of spark plugs and carburettor kits. This place will be dead until 
next year, and you know it.' 
That was certainly true enough, but he hadn't needed a snotnose kid to point it out for him. 
'You want to go to Albany for me after you get back?' Will had asked. 
Arnie looked at him carefully. 'When?' 
'This weekend.' 
'Saturday?' 
'Yes.' 
'What's the deal?' 
'You take my Chrysler to Albany that's the fucking deal. Henry Buck was fourteen clean 
used cars he wants to get rid of. He says they're clean. You go look at them. I'll give you a 
blank cheque. If they look good, you make the deal. If they look hot, tell him to take a flying 
fuck at a rolling doughnut.' 
'And what do I fake with me?' 
Will had looked at him for a long time. 'Getting scared, Cunningham?' 
'No.' Arnie crushed his cigar out half-smoked. He looked at Will defensively. 'Maybe I just 
feel the odds getting a little longer each time I do it. Is it coke?'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'I'll get Jimmy to do it,' Will said brusquely. 
'Just tell me what it is.' 
'Two hundred cartons of Winstons.' 
'All right.' 
'You sure? Just like that?' 
Arnie had laughed. 'It'll be a break from chess.' 
* * * * * 
Will parked the Chrysler in the stall closest to his office, the one with MR DARNELL DO 
NOT BLOCK! painted inside the lines. He got out and slammed the door, puffing, labouring 
for breath. The emphysema was sitting on his chest, and tonight it seemed to have brought its 
brother. No, he just wasn't going to lie down; no matter what that asshole doctor said. 
Jimmy Sykes was apathetically wielding the big push broom. Jimmy was tall and gangling, 
twenty-five years old. His light mental retardation made him look perhaps eight years 
younger. He had started combing his hair back in a fifties-style ducktail, in imitation of 
Cunningham, whom Jimmy almost worshipped. Except for the low whssht, whssht of the 
broom's bristles on the oil-stained concrete, the place was silent. And empty. 
'Place is really jumpin tonight, Jimmy, huh?' Will wheezed. 
Jimmy looked around. 'No, sir, Mr Darnell, nobody been in since Mr Hatch came and got 
his Fairlane, and that was half an hour ago.' 
'Just joking,' Will said, wishing again that Cunningham were here. You couldn't talk to 
Jimmy except on a perfectly literal Dick-and-Jane level. Still, maybe he would invite him in 
for a cup of coffee with a slug of Courvoisier tipped in for good measure. Make it a 
threesome. Him, Jimmy, and the emphysema. Or maybe, since the emphysema had brought 
its brother tonight, you'd have to call it a foursome. 'What do you say about - ' 
He broke off suddenly, noticing that stall twenty was empty. Christine was gone. 
'Arnie come in?' he said. 
'Arnie?' Jimmy repeated, blinkin stupidly. 
'Arnie, Arnie Cunningham,' Will said impatiently. 'How many Arnies do you know? His 
car's gone.' 
Jimmy looked around at stall twenty and frowned. 'Oh. Yeah.' 
Will smiled. 'Hotshot got knocked out of his hotshot chess tournament, huh?' 
'Oh, did he?' Jimmy asked. 'Jeez, that's too bad, huh?'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Will restrained an urge to grab Jimmy and give him a shake and a wallop. He would not get 
angry; that only made it harder to breathe, and he would end up having to shoot his lungs full 
of the horrible-tasting stuff from his aspirator. 'Well, what did he say, Jimmy? What did he 
say when you saw him?' But Will knew suddenly and surely that Jimmy hadn't seen Arnie. 
Jimmy finally understood what Will was driving at. 'Oh, I didn't see him. Just saw Christine 
go out the door, you know. Boy, that's some pretty car, ain't it? He fixed it up like magic.' 
'Yes,' Will said. 'Like magic.' It was a word that had occurred to him in connection with 
Christine before. He suddenly changed his mind about inviting Jimmy in for coffee and 
brandy. Still looking at stall twenty, he said, 'You can go home now, Jimmy.' 
'Aw, jeez, Mr Darnell, you said I could have six hours tonight. That ain't over until ten.' 
'I'll punch you out at ten. 
Jimmy's muddy eyes brightened at this unexpected, almost unheard-of largesse. 'Really?' 
'Yeah, really, really. Make like a tree and leave, Jimmy, okay?' 
'Sure,' Jimmy said, thinking that for the first time in the five or six years he had worked for 
Will (he had trouble remembering which it was, although his mother kept track of it, the same 
as she kept track of all his tax papers), the old grouch had gotten the Christmas spirit. Just 
like in that movie about the three ghosts. Summoning up his own Christmas spirit, Jimmy 
cried: 'That's a big ten-four, good buddy!' 
Will winced and lumbered into his office. He turned on the Mr Coffee and sat down behind 
his desk, watching as Jimmy put away his broom, turned out most of the overhead 
fluorescents, and got his heavy coat. 
Will leaned back and thought. 
It was, after all, his brains that had kept him alive all these years, alive and one step ahead; 
he had never been handsome, he had been fat all of his adult life, and his health had always 
been terrible. A childhood bout of scarlet fever one spring had been followed by a mild case 
of polio; he had been left with a right arm that operated at only about seventy per cent 
capacity. As a young man he had endured a plague of boils. When Will was forty-three his 
doctor had discovered a large, spongy growth under one arm. It had turned out to be non-
malignant, but the removal surgery had kept him on his back most of one summer, and as a 
result he had developed bedsores. A year later he had almost died of double pneumonia. Now 
it was incipient diabetes and emphysema. But his brains had always been fine and dandy, and 
his brains had kept him one step ahead. 
So he leaned back and thought about Arnie. He supposed one of the things that had 
favourably impressed him about Cunningham after he had stood up to Repperton that day 
was a certain similarity to the long-ago teenaged Will Darnell. Of course, Cunningham wasn't 
sickly, but he had been pimply, disliked, a loner. Those things had all been true of the young 
Will Darnell.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Cunningham had brains, too. 
Brains and that car. That strange car. 
'Good night, Mr Darnell,' Jimmy called. He stood by the door for a moment, and then added 
uncertainly, 'Merry Christmas.' 
Will raised his hand in a wave. Jimmy left. Will heaved his bulk out of his chair, got the 
bottle of Courvoisier out of the filing cabinet, and set it down next to the Mr Coffee. Then he 
sat down again. A rough chronology was ticking through his mind. 
August: Cunningham brings in an old wreck of a '58 Plymouth and parks it in stall twenty. 
It looks familiar, and it should. It's Rollie LeBay's Plymouth. And Arnie doesn't know it - he 
has no need to know - but once upon a time Rollie LeBay also made an occasional run to 
Albany or Burlington or Portsmouth for Will Darnell . . . only in those dim dead days, Will 
had a '54 Cadillac. Different transport cars, same false-bottom boot with the hidden 
compartment for fireworks, cigarettes, booze, and pot. In those days Will had never heard of 
cocaine. He supposed no one but jazz musicians in New York had. 
Late August: Repperton and Cunningham get into it, and Darnell kicks Repperton out. He's 
tired of Repperton, the constant braggadocio, the cock-of-the-walk manner. He's hurting 
custom, and while he'll make all the runs into New York and New England that Will wants, 
he's careless, and carelessness is dangerous. He has a tendency to exceed the double-nickel 
speed limit, he's gotten speeding tickets. All it would take is one nosy cop to put them all in 
court. Darnell isn't afraid of going to jail - not in Libertyville but it would look bad. There 
was a time when he didn't care much how things looked, but he's older now. 
Will got up, poured coffee, and tipped in a capful of brandy. He paused, thought it over, 
and tipped in a second capful. He sat down, took a cigar out of his breast pocket, looked at it, 
and lit it. Fuck you, emphysema. Take this. 
Fragrant smoke rising around him, good hot coffee laced with brandy before him, Darnell 
stared out into his shadowy, silent garage and thought some more. 
September: The kid asks him to jump an inspection sticker and loan him a dealer plate so he 
can take his girl to a football game. Darnell does it - hell, there was a day when he used to 
sell inspection stickers for seven dollars and never even look at the car it was going on. 
Besides, the kid's car is looking good. A little rough, maybe, and it's still more than a little 
noisy, but all in all, pretty damn good. He's going a real job of restoration. 
And that's pretty damn strange, isn't it, when you consider that no one has ever seen him 
really work on it. 
Oh, little things, sure. Replacing bulbs in the parking lights. Changing tyres. The kid is no 
dummy about cars: Will sat right in this chair one day and watched him replace the 
upholstery in the back seat. But no one has seen him working on the car's exhaust system, 
which was totally shot when he wheeled the '58 in here for the first time late last summer.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">And no one has seen him doing any bodywork, either, although the Fury's bod, which had an 
advanced case of cancer when the kid brought it in, now looks cherry. 
Darnell knew what Jimmy Sykes thought, because he had asked him once. Jimmy thought 
Arnie did the serious work at night, after everyone was gone. 
'That's one hell of a lot of night work,' Darnell said aloud, and felt a sudden chill that not 
even the brandy-laced coffee could dispel, A lot of night work, yeah. It must have been. 
Because what the kid seemed to be doing days was listening to the greaser music on WDIL. 
That, and a lot of aimless fooling around. 
'I guess he does the big stuff at night,' Jimmy had said, with all the guileless faith of a child 
explaining how Santa Claus gets down the chimney or how the tooth fairy put the quarter 
under his pillow. Will didn't believe in either Santa Claus or the tooth fairy, and he didn't 
believe that Arnie had restored Christine at night, either. 
Two other facts rolled around uneasily in his mind like poolballs looking for a pocket in 
which to come to rest. 
He knew that Cunningham had been driving the car around out back a lot before it was 
street-legal, that was one thing. Just cruising slowly up and down the narrow lanes between 
the thousands of junked cars in the block-long back lot. Driving at five miles an hour, around 
and around after dark, after everyone had gone home, circling the big crane with the round 
electromagnet and the great box of the car-crusher. Cruising. The one time Darnell asked him 
about it, Arnie had told him he was checking out a shimmy in the front end. But the kid 
couldn't lie for shit. No one ever checked out a shimmy at five miles an hour. 
That was what Cunningham did after everyone else went home. That had been his night 
work. Cruising out back, threading his way in and out of the junkets, headlights flickering 
unsteadily in their rust-eaten sockets. 
Then there was the Plymouth's milometer. It ran backward. Cunningham had pointed that 
out to him with a sly little smile. It ran backward at an extremely fast rate. He told Will that 
he figured the milometer turned back five miles or so for every actual mile travelled. Will had 
been frankly amazed. He had heard of setting milometers back in the used-car business, and 
he had done a good bit of it himself (along with stuffing transmissions full of sawdust to stifle 
their death whines and pouring boxes of oatmeal into terminally ill radiators to temporarily 
plug their leaks), but he had never seen one that ran backward spontaneously. He would have 
thought it impossible. Arnie had just smiled a funny little smile and called it a glitch.  
It was a glitch, all right , Will thought. One hell of a glitch. 
The two thoughts clicked lazily off each other and rolled in different directions. 
Boy, that's some pretty car, isn't it? He fixed it up like magic. 
Will didn't believe in Santa Claus or the tooth fairy, but he was perfectly willing to 
acknowledge that there were strange things in the world. A practical man recognized that and</p>
      <p class="calibre3">put it to use if he could. A friend of Will's who lived in Los Angeles claimed he had seen the 
ghost of his wife before the big quake of '67, and Will had no particular reason to doubt the 
claim (although he would have doubted it completely if the friend had had anything to gain). 
Quent Youngerman, another friend, had claimed to have seen his father, long dead, standing 
at the foot of his hospital bed after Quent, a steel-worker, had taken a terrible fall from the 
fourth floor of a building under construction down on Wood Street. 
Will had heard such stories off and on all his life, as most people undoubtedly did. And as 
most thinking people probably did, he put them in a kind of open file, neither believing nor 
disbelieving, unless the teller was an obvious crank. He put them in that open file because no 
one knew where people came from when they were born and no one knew where people went 
when they died, and not all the Unitarian ministers and born-again Jesus-shouters and Popes 
and Scientologists in the world could convince Will otherwise. Just because some people 
went crazy on the subject didn't mean they knew anything. He put stuff like that in that open 
file because nothing really inexplicable had ever happened to him. 
Except maybe something like that was happening now. 
November: Repperton and his good buddies beat the living shit out of Cunningham's car at 
the airport. When it comes in on the tow-truck, it looks like the Green Giant shat all over it. 
Darnell looks at it and thinks, It's never gonna run again. That's all; it's never gonna run 
another foot. 
At the end of the month the Welch kid gets killed on JFK Drive. 
December: A State Police detective comes sucking around. Junkins. He comes sucking 
around one day and talks to Cunningham; then he comes sucking around on a day when 
Cunningham isn't here and wants to know how come the kid is lying about how much 
damage Repperton and his dogturd friends (of whom the late and unlamented Peter 'Moochie' 
Welch was one) did to Cunningham's Plymouth. Why you talking to me? Darnell asks him, 
wheezing and coughing through a cloud of cigar smoke, Talk to him, it's his fucking 
Plymouth, not mine. I just run this place so working joes can keep their cars running and 
keep putting food on the tables for their families. 
Junkins listens patiently to this rap. He knows Will Darnell is doing a hell of a lot more 
than just running a do-it-yourself garage and a junkyard, but Darnell knows he knows, so 
that's okay. 
Junkins lights a cigarette and says, I'm talking to you because I already talked to the kid 
and he won't tell me. For a little while there I thought he wanted to tell me; I got the feeling 
he's scared green about sometliing. Then he tightened up and wouldn't tell me squat. 
Darnell says, If you think Arnie ran down that Welch kid, say so. 
Junkins says, I don't. His parents say he was home asleep, and it doesn't feel like they're 
lying to cover up for him. But Welch was one of the guys that trashed his car, we're pretty</p>
      <p class="calibre3">sure of that, and I'm positive he's lying about how bad they trashed it and I don't know why 
and it's driving me crazy. 
Too bad, Darnell says with no sympathy at all. 
Junkins asks, How bad was it, Mr Darnell? You tell me. 
And Darnell tells his first and only lie during the interview with Junkins: I really didn't 
notice. 
He noticed, all right, and he knows why Arnie is lying about it, trying to minimize it, and 
this cop would know why too, if it wasn't so obvious he was walking all over it instead of 
seeing it. Cunningham is lying because the damage was horrible, the damage was much 
worse than this state gumshoe can imagine, those hoods didn't just beat up on Cunningham's 
'58, they killed it. Cunningham is lying because, altthough nobody saw him do much of 
anything during the week after the tow-truck brought Christine back to stall twenty, the car 
was basically as good as new - even better than it had been before. 
Cunningham lied to the cop because the truth was incredible. 
'Incredible,' Darnell said out loud, and drank the rest of his coffee. He looked down at the 
telephone, reached for it, and then drew his hand back. He had a call to make, but it might be 
better to finish thinking this through first - have all his ducks in a row. 
He himself was the only one (other than Cunningham himself) who could appreciate the 
incredibility of what had happened: the car's complete and total exoneration. Jimmy was too 
soft in the attic, and the other guys were in and out, not regular custom at all. Still, there had 
been comments about what a fantastic job Cunningham had done; a lot of the guys who had 
been doing repairs on their rolling iron during that week in November had used the word 
incredible, and several of them had looked uneasy. Johnny Pomberton, who bought and sold 
used trucks, had been trying to get an old dumpster he'd picked up in running shape that 
week. Johnny knew cars and trucks better than anyone else in Libertyville, maybe anyone 
else in all of Pennsylvania. He told Will frankly and flat-out that he couldn't believe it. It's 
like voodoo, Johnny Pomberton had said, and then uttered a laugh without much humour. 
Will only sat there looking politely interested, and after a second or two the old man shook 
his head and went away. 
Sitting in his office and looking out at the garage, eerily silent in the slack time that came 
every year in the weeks before Christmas, Will thought (not for the first time) that most 
people would accept anything they saw it happen right before their very eyes. In a very real 
sense there was no supernatural, no abnormal; what happened, happened, and that was the 
end. 
* * * * * 
Jimmy Sykes: Like magic. 
Junkins: He's lying about it, but I'll be goddamned if I know why.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Will pulled open his desk drawer, denting his paunch, and found his note-minder book for 
1978. He paged through it and found his own scrawled entry: Cunningham. Chess Tourney. 
Philly Sheraton Dec. 11-13. 
He called Directory Assistance, got the number of the hotel, and made the call. He was not 
too surprised to feet his heartbeat shifting into a higher gear as the phone rang and the desk 
clerk picked it up. 
Like magic. 
'Hello, Philadelphia-Sheraton. 
'Hello,' Will said, 'You have a chess tournament put up there, I th - ' 
'Northern States, yessir,' the desk clerk broke in. He sounded quick and almost insufferably 
young. 
'I'm calling from Libertyville, Pee-Ay,' Will said. 'I believe you have an LHS student named 
Arnold Cunningham registered. He's one of the chess tourney kids. I'd like to speak to him, if 
he's in.' 
'Just a moment, sir, I'll see.' 
Clunk. Will was put on hold. He cocked himself back on his swivel chair and sat that way 
for what seemed to be a very long time, although the red second-hand on the office clock 
only revolved once. He won't be there, and if he is, I'll eat my - 
'Hello?' 
The voice was young, warily cautious and unmistakably Cunningham's. Will Darnell felt a 
peculiar lift-drop in his belly, but none of it showed in his voice; he was much too old for 
that. 
'Hi, Cunningham,' he said. 'Darnell.' 
'Yeah.' 
'What are you up to, Will'?' 
'How you doing, kid?' 
'Won yesterday and drew today. Bullshit game. Couldn't seem to keep my mind on it. 
What's up?' 
Yes, it was Cunningham - him without a doubt. 
Will, who would no more call someone without a cover story than he would go out without 
his skivvies on, said smoothly, 'You got a pencil, kiddo?' 
'Sure.'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'There's an outfit on North Broad Street, United Auto Parts. You think you could go by 
there and see what they've got for tyres?' 
'Remoulds?' Arnie asked. 
'First-lines.' 
'Sure, I can go by. I'm free tomorrow afternoon from noon until three.' 
'That'll be fine. You ask for Roy Mustungerra, and mention my name.' 
'Spell that.' 
Will spelled it. 
'That's all?' 
'Yeah . . . except I hope you get your ass whuped.' 
'Fat chance,' Cunningham said, and laughed. Will told him goodbye and hung up. 
It was Cunningham, no doubt about that. Cunningham was in Philadelphia tonight, and 
Philadelphia was almost three hundred miles away, 
Who could he have given an extra set of keys to? 
The Guilder kid. 
Sure! Except the Guilder kid was in the hospital. 
His girl. 
But she didn't have a driver's licence or even a permit. Arnie had said so. 
Someone else. 
There was no one else. Cunningham wasn't close to anyone else except for Will himself, 
and Will knew damned well Cunningham had never given him a dupe set of keys. 
Like magic. 
Shit. 
Will leaned back in his chair again and lit another cigar. When it was going and the neatly 
clipped-off end was in his ashtray, he looked up at the raftering smoke and thought it over. 
Nothing came. Cunningham was in Philly and he had gone on the high school bus, but his car 
was gone. Jimmy Sykes had seen it pulling out, but Jimmy hadn't seen who was driving it. 
Now just what did all of that mean? What did it add up to? 
Gradually, his mind turned into other channels. He thought of his own high school days, 
when he had had the lead part in the senior play. His part had been that of the minister who is</p>
      <p class="calibre3">driven to suicide by his lust for Sadie Thompson, the girl he has set out to save. He had 
brought down the house. His one moment of glory in a high school career that had been 
devoid of sporting or academic triumphs, and maybe the high point of his youth - his father 
had been a drunk, his mother a drudge, his one brother a deadbeat with his own moment of 
glory coming somewhere in Germany, his only applause the steady pounding of German 88s. 
He thought of his one girlfriend, a pallid blonde named Wanda Haskins, whose white 
cheeks had been splattered with freckles which grew painfully profuse in the August sun. 
They almost surely would have married - Wanda was one of four girls that Will Darnell had 
actually fucked (he excluded whores from his count). She was surely the only one he had 
ever loved (always assuming there was such a thing - and, like the supernatural events he had 
sometimes heard about but never witnessed, he could doubt its existence but not disprove it), 
but her father had been in the Army, and Wanda had been an Army brat. At the age of fifteen 
- perhaps only a year before the mystic shift in the balance of power from the hands of the old 
into those of the young - she and her family had moved to Wichita, and that had been the end 
of that. 
There was a certain lipstick she had worn, and in that long-ago summer of 1934 it had 
tasted like fresh raspberries to a Will Darnell who was still quite slim and clear-eyed and 
ambitious and young. It had been a taste to make the left hand stray to the erect and 
enthusiastic root of the penis in the middle of the night . . . and even before Wanda Haskins 
consented, they had danced that sweet and special dance in Will Darnell's dreams. In his 
narrow child's bed that was too short for his growing legs, they had danced. 
And, now thinking of this dance, Will ceased to think and began to dream and, ceasing to 
dream, began to dance again. 
* * * * * 
He awakened from a sleep that had never really deepened solidly some three hours later; he 
awoke to the sound of the big garage door rattling up and the inside light over the door - no 
fluorescent but a blaring 200-watt bulb - coming on. 
Will tilted his chair down in a hurry. His shoes hit the mat under his desk (BARDAHL 
written across it in raised rubber letters), and it was the shock of pins and needles in his feet 
more than anything else that brought him awake. 
Christine moved slowly across the garage towards stall twenty and slipped in. 
Will, hardly convinced even now that he was awake, watched her with a curious lack of 
excitement which perhaps only belongs to those summoned directly from their dreams. He sat 
upright behind his desk, hamlike arms planted on his dirty, doodled-upon blotter, and 
watched her. 
The engine raced once, twice. The bright new exhaust pipe shot blue smoke. 
Then the motor shut down.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Will sat there, not moving. 
His door was shut, but there was an intercom, always on, between the office and the long, 
barnlike garage area. It was the same intercom on which he had heard the beginnings of the 
Cunningham-Repperton title fight back in August. From the intercom's speaker he now heard 
the steady tick of metal as the engine cooled. He heard nothing else. 
No one got out of Christine, because there was no one in her to get out. 
He put stuff like that in an open file because nothing really inexplicable had ever happened 
to him . . . except maybe something like that was happening now. 
He had seen her cross the cement to stall twenty, the automatic door rattling shut against the 
cold December night behind her. And experts, examining the case later, could say: The 
witness had dozed and then fallen asleep, he admits that much, and that he was dreaming . . . 
what he claims to have seen was obviously nothing more or less than an extension of that 
dream, an outward stimulus causing a subjective range of spontaneous, dream-oriented 
imagery . . . 
Yes, they could say that, just as Will could dream of dancing with fifteen-year-old Wanda 
Haskins . . . but the reality was a hard-headed man of sixty-one, a man who had long since 
jettisoned any last romantic notions. 
And he had seen Cunningham's '58 glide across the garage empty, the steering wheel 
moving all by itself as the car slipped into her accustomed stall. He had seen the headlights 
go off, and he had heard the eight-cylinder engine as it died. 
Now, feeling oddly boneless, Will Darnell got up, hesitated, went to the door of his office, 
hesitated again, and then opened it. He walked out and moved down the ranks of slant-parked 
cars to stall twenty. His footfalls echoed behind him and then died out in a mystery. 
He stood beside the car with her rich two-tone body, red and white. The paint job was deep 
and clear and perfect, umarred by the smallest chip or the slightest touch of rust. The glass 
was clear and unbroken, not marked by so much as a nick caused by a random-flying pebble. 
The only sound now was the slow drip of melting snow from the front and rear bumpers. 
Will touched the hood. It was warm. 
He tried the driver's side door, and it opened freely. The smell that issued forth was the 
warm smell of new leather, new plastic, new chrome - except that there seemed to be another, 
more unpleasant smell beneath it. An earthy smell. Will breathed deep but could not place it. 
He thought briefly of old turnips in his father's basement vegetable bin, and his nose 
wrinkled. 
He leaned in. There were no keys in the ignition. The milometer read 52,107.8.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Suddenly the empty ignition slot set into the dashboard revolved, the black slit heeling over 
of its own accord past ACC to START. The hot engine caught at once and rumbled steadily, 
full of contented high-octane power. 
Will's heart staggered in his chest. His breath caught. Gasping and whooping noisily for 
breath, he hurried back to his office to find the spare aspirator in one of his desk drawers. His 
breath, thin and impotent, sounded like winter wind under an entryway door. His face was the 
colour of old candlewax. His fingers caught in the loose flesh of his throat and pulled 
restlessly. 
Christine's engine turned off again. 
No sound now but the tick and click of cooling metal. 
Will found his aspirator, plunged it deep into his throat, depressed the trigger, and inhaled. 
Little by little, the feeling that a wheelbarrowful of cinderblocks was sitting on his chest 
dissipated. He sat down in the swivel chair and listened gratefully to the sane and expected 
creak of protest from its springs. He covered his face momentarily with his fat hands. 
Nothing really inexplicable . . . until now. 
He had seen it. 
Nothing had been driving that car. It had come in empty, smelling of something like rotting 
turnips. 
And even then, in spite of his dread, Will's mind began to turn and he began wondering

The burned out wreck of Buddy Repperton's Camaro was found late on Wednesday 
afternoon by a park ranger. An old lady who lived with her husband in the tiny town of Upper 
Squantic had called the ranger station on the lake side of the park. She was badly afflicted 
with arthritis, and sometimes she couldn't sleep. Last night she thought she had seen flames 
coming from near the park's south gate. At what time? She reckoned it to be around quarter 
past ten, because she had been watching the Tuesday Night Movie on CBS and it hadn't been 
but half over. 
On Thursday, a newsphoto of the burned car appeared on the front page of the Libertyville 
Keystone under a headline which read: THREE KILLED IN CAR CRASH AT SQUANTIC 
HILLS STATE PARK. A State Police source was quoted as saying 'liquor had probably been a 
factor' - an officially opaque way of saying that the shattered remains of over half a dozen 
bottles of a juice-and-wine combination sold under the trade name Texas Driver had been 
found in the wreckage. 
The news struck particularly hard at Libertyville High School; the young always have the 
greatest difficulty accepting unpleasant intelligence of their own mortality. Perhaps the 
holiday season made it that much harder. 
Arnie Cunningham found himself terribly depressed by the news, Depressed and 
frightened. First Moochie; now Buddy, Richie Trelawney, and Bobby Stanton. Bobby 
Stanton, a dipshit little freshman Arnie had never even heard of - what had a dipshit little kid 
like that been doing with the likes of Buddy Repperton and Richie Trelawney anyway? Didn't 
he know that was like going into a den of tigers with nothing for protection but a squirt gun. 
He found it unaccountably hard to accept the grapevine version, which was simply that 
Buddy and his friends had gotten pretty well squiffed at the basketball game, and gone out 
cruising and drinking, and had come to a bad end.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">He couldn't quite lose the feeling he was somehow involved. 
Leigh had stopped talking to him since the argument. Arnie didn't call her - partly out of 
pride, partly out of shame, partly out of a wish that she would call him first and things could 
go back to what they had been . . . before. 
Before what? his mind whispered. Well, before she almost choked to death in your car, for 
one thing. Before you tried to punch out the guy who saved her life. 
But she wanted him to sell Christine. And that was simply impossible . . . wasn't it? How 
could he do that after he had put so much time and effort and blood and - yes, it was true - 
even tears into it? 
It was an old rap, and he didn't want to think about it. The final bell rang on that seemingly 
endless Thursday, and he went out to the student parking lot - almost ran out and nearly dived 
into Christine. 
He sat there behind the wheel and drew a long, shuddering breath, watching the first 
snowflakes of an afternoon flurry twist and skirl across the bright bonnet. He dug for his 
keys, pulled them out of his pocket, and started Christine up. The motor hummed confidently 
and he pulled out, tyres rolling and cruching over the packed snow. He would have to put 
snow tyres on eventually, he supposed, but the truth was, Christine didn't seem to need them. 
She had the best traction of any car he had ever driven. 
He felt for the radio knob and turned on WDIL. Sheb Wooley was singing 'The Purple 
People Eater.' That raised a smile on his face at last. 
Just being behind Christine's wheel, in control, made everything seem better. It made 
everything seem manageable. Hearing about Repperton and Trelawney and the little shitter 
stepping out that way had been a terrible shock, naturally, and after the hard feelings of the 
late summer and this fall, it was probably natural enough for him to feel a little guilty. But the 
simple truth was, he had been in Philly. He hadn't had anything to do with it; it was 
impossible. 
He had just been feeling low about things in general. Dennis was in the hospital. Leigh was 
behaving stupidly as if his car had grown hands and jammed that piece of hamburger down 
her throat, for Christ's sake. And he had quit the chess club today. 
Maybe the worst part of that had been the way Mr Slawson, the faculty advisor, had 
accepted his decision without even trying to change his mind, Arnie had given him a lot of 
guff about how little time he had these days, and how he was simply going to have to cut 
back on some of his activities, and Mr Slawson had simply nodded and said, Okay, Arnie, 
we'll be right here in Room 30 if you change your mind. Mr Slawson had looked at him with 
his faded blue eyes that his thick glasses magnified to the size of repulsive boiled eggs, and 
there had been something in them - was it reproach?</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Maybe it had been. But the guy hadn't even tried to persuade him to stay, that was the 
thing. He should have at least tried, because Arnie was the best the LHS chess club had to 
offer, and Slawson knew it. If he had tried, maybe Arnie would have changed his mind. The 
truth was, he did have a little more time now that Christine was . . . was . . . What? 
. . . well, fixed up again. If Mr Slawson had said something like Hey Arnie, don't be so 
rash, let's think this over, we could really use you . . . if Mr Slawson had said something like 
that, why, he might have reconsidered. But not Slawson. Just we'll be right here in Room 30 
if you change your mind, and blah-blah and yak-yak, what a fucking shitter, just like the rest 
of them. It wasn't his fault that LHS had been knocked out in the semi-final round; he had 
won four games before that and would have won in the finals if he had gotten a chance. It 
was those two shitters Barry Qualson and Mike Hicks that had lost it for them; both of them 
played chess as if maybe they thought Ruy Lopex was some new kind of soft drink or 
something . . . . 
He stripped the wrapper and the foil from a stick of gum, folded the gum into his mouth, 
balled the wrapper, and flicked it into the litterbag hanging from Christine's ashtray with neat 
accuracy, 'Right up the little tramp's ass,' he muttered, and then grinned. It was a hard, 
spitless grin. Above it, his eyes moved restlessly from side to side, looking mistrustfully out 
at a world full of crazy drivers and stupid pedestrians and general idiocy. 
Arnie cruised aimlessly around Libertyville, his thoughts continuing to run on in this softly 
paranoid and bitterly comforting fashion. The radio spilled out a steady flood of golden 
oldies, and today all of them seemed to be instrumentals - 'Rebel Rouser', 'Wild Weekend', 
'Telstar', Sandy Nelson's jungle-driven 'Teen Beat', and 'Rumble' by Line Wray, the greatest 
of them all. His back nagged, but in a low key. The flurry intensified briefly to a dark grey 
cloud of snow. He popped on his headlights, and just as quickly the snow tapered off and the 
clouds broke, spilling through bars of remote and coldly beautiful late-afternoon winter sun. 
He cruised. 
He came out of his thoughts which now were that Repperton had maybe come to a perfectly 
fitting end after all - and was shocked to realize that it was nearly quarter of six, and dark. 
Gino's Pizza was coming up on the left, the little green neon shamrocks shimmering in the 
dark. Arnie pulled over to the kerb and got out. He started to cross the street, then realized he 
had left his keys in Christine's ignition. 
He leaned in to get them . . . and suddenly the smell assaulted him, the smell Leigh had told 
him about, the smell he had denied. 
It was here now, as if it had come out when he left the car - a high, rotten, meaty smell that 
made his eyes water and his throat close. He snatched the keys and stood back, trembling, 
looking at Christine with something like horror. 
Arnie, there was a smell. A horrible, rotten smell . . . you know what I'm talking about. 
No, I don't have the slightest idea . . . you're imagining things.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">But if she was, so was he. 
Arnie turned suddenly and ran across the street to Gino's as if the devil was on his tail. 
* * * * * 
Inside, he ordered a pizza he didn't really want, changed some quarters for dimes, and 
slipped into the telephone booth beside the juke. It was thumping some current tune Arnie 
had not heard before. 
He called home first. His father answered, his voice oddly toneless - Arnie had never heard 
Michael's voice quite that way before, and his unease deepened. His father sounded like Mr 
Slawson. This Thursday afternoon and evening were taking on the maroon tones of 
nightmare. Beyond the glass walls of the booth, strange faces drifted dreamily past, like 
untethered balloons on which someone had crudely drawn human faces, God at work with a 
Magic Marker. 
Shitters,he thought disjointedly. All a bunch of shitters. 
'Hello, Dad,' he said uncertainly. 'Look, I - uh, I kind of lost track of the time here, I'm 
sorry.' 
'That's all right,' Michael said. His voice was almost a drone, and Arnie felt his unease 
deepen into something like fright. 'Where are you, the garage?' 
'No - uh, Gino's. Gino's Pizza. Dad, are you okay? You sound funny.' 
'I'm fine,' Michael said. 'Just scraped your dinner down the garbage disposal, your mother's 
upstairs crying again, and you're having a pizza. I'm fine. Enjoying your car, Arnie?' 
Arnie's throat worked, but no sound came out. 
'Dad,' he managed finally, 'I don't think that's very fair.' 
'I don't think I'm very interested anymore in what you think is fair and what you don't think 
is fair,' Michael said. 'You had some justification for your behaviour at first, perhaps. But in 
the last month or so you've turned into someone I don't understand at all, and something is 
going on that I understand even less. Your mother doesn't understand it either, but she senses 
it, and it's hurting her very badly. I know she brought part of the hurt on herself, but I doubt if 
that changes the quality of the pain.' 
'Dad, I just lost track of the time!' Arnie cried. 'Stop making such a big thing out of it!' 
'Were you driving around?' 
'Yes, but - ' 
'I notice that's when it usually happens, Michael said. 'Will you be home tonight?'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'Yes, early,' Arnie said. He wet his lips. 'I just want to go by the garage, I have some 
information Will asked me to get while I was in Philly 
'I'm not very interested in that either, pardon me,' Michael said. His voice was still polite, 
chillingly disconnected. 
'Oh,' Arnie said in a very small voice. He was very scared now, almost trembling. 
'Arnie?' 
'What?' Arnie nearly whispered. 
'What is going on?' 
'I don't know what you mean.' 
'Please. That detective came by to see me at my office. He was after Regina, as well. He 
upset her very badly. I don't think he meant to, but - ' 
'What was it this time?' Arnie asked' fiercely. 'That fucker, what was it this time? I'll - ' 
'You'll what?' 
'Nothing.' He swallowed something that tasted like a lump of dust. 'What was it this time?' 
'Repperton,' his father said. 'Repperton and those other two boys. What did you think it 
was? The geopolitical situation in Brazil?' 
'What happened to Repperton was an accident,' Arnie said. 'Why did he want to talk to you 
and Mom about something that was an accident, for Christ's sake?' 
'I don't know.' Michael Cunningham paused. 'Do you?' 
'How would I?' Arnie yelled. 'I was in Philadelphia, how would I know anything about it? I 
was playing chess, not . . . not . . . not anything else,' he finished lamely. 
'One more time,' Michael Cunningham said. 'Is something going on, Arnie?' 
He thought of the smell, the high, rotting stink. Leigh choking, digging at her throat, 
turning blue. He had tried to thump her on the back because that's what you did when 
someone was choking, there was no such thing as a Heimlich Manoeuvre because it hadn't 
been invented yet, and besides, that was how it was supposed to end, only not in the car. . . 
beside the road . . . in his arms . . . 
He closed his eyes and the whole world seemed to tilt and swirl sickly. 
'Arnie?' 
'There is nothing going on,' he said through clenched teeth and without opening his eyes. 
'Nothing but a lot of people who are on my case because I finally got something of my own 
and did it all by myself.'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'All right,' his father said, his lacklustre voice once more terribly reminiscent of Mr 
Slawson's. 'If you want to talk about it, I'm here. I always have been, although I didn't always 
make that as clear as I should have. Be sure to kiss your mother when you come in, Arnie.' 
'Yeah, I will. Listen, Mi - ' 
Click. 
He stood in the booth, listening stupidly to the sound of nothing at all. His father was gone. 
There wasn't even a dial tone because it was a dumb fucking . . . phone booth. 
He dug into his pocket and spread his change out on the little metal shelf where he could 
look at it. He picked up a dime, almost dropped it, and at last got it into the slot. He felt sick 
and overheated. He felt as if he had been very efficiently disowned. 
He dialled Leigh's number from memory. 
Mrs Cabot picked the phone up and recognized his voice immediately. Her pleasant and 
rather sexy come-hither-thou-fascinating-stranger phone voice became instantly hard. Arnie 
had had his last chance with her, that voice said, and he had blown it. 
'She doesn't want to talk to you and she doesn't want to see you,' she said. 
'Mrs Cabot, please, if I could just - ' 
'I think you've done enough,' Mrs Cabot said coolly. 'She came in crying the other night and 
she's been crying off and on ever since. She had some sort of a. . . an experience with you the 
last time you and she went out, and I only pray it wasn't what I thought it was. I - ' 
Arnie felt hysterical laughter bubbling up inside him. Leigh had almost choked to death on 
a hamburger, and her mother was afraid Arnie had tried to rape her. 
'Mrs Cabot, I have to talk to her.' 
'I'm afraid not.' 
He tried to think of something else to say, some way to get past the dragon at the gate. He 
felt a little like a Fuller Brush salesman trying to get in to see the lady of the house. His 
tongue wouldn't move. He would have made a lousy salesman. There was going to be that 
hard click and then smooth silence again. 
Then he heard the telephone change hands, Mrs Cabot said something in sharp protest, and 
Leigh said something back; it was too muffled for him to catch. Then Leigh's voice said, 
'Arnie?' 
'Hi,' he said. 'Leigh, I just wanted to call and tell you how sorry I was about - ' 
'Yes,' Leigh said 'I know you were, and I accept your apology, Arnie. But I won't - I can't 
go out with you anymore. Unless things change.'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'Ask me something easy,' he whispered. 
'That's all I - ' Her voice sharpened, moved slightly away from the telephone. 'Mom, please 
stop hanging over me!' Her mother said something that sounded disgruntled, there was a 
pause, and then Leigh's voice again, low. 'That's all I can say, Arnie. I know how crazy it 
sounds, but I still think your car tried to kill me the other night. I don't know how something 
like that could be, but no matter how I work it over in my mind, it comes out seeing that that 
was how it was. I know that's how it was. It's got you, doesn't it?' 
'Leigh, if you'll pardon my French, that's pretty fucking stupid. It's a car! Can you spell that 
C-A-R, car! There's nothing - ' 
'Yes,' she said, and now her voice was wavering toward tears. 'It's got you, she's got you, 
and I guess nobody can get you free except you.' 
His back suddenly awoke and began to throb, sending pain out in a sickish radiation that 
seemed to echo and amplify in his head. 
'Isn't that the truth of it, Arnie?' 
He didn't, couldn't, answer. 
'Get rid of it,' Leigh said. 'Please. I read about that Repperton boy in the paper this morning, 
and - ' 
'What's that got to do with anything?' Arnie croaked. And for the second time: 'That was an 
accident.' 
'I don't know what it was. Maybe I don't want to know. But it isn't us I'm worried about 
anymore. It's you, Arnie. I'm scared for you. You ought to - no, you have to get rid of it.' 
Arnie whispered, 'Just say you won't dump me, Leigh. Okay?' 
Now she was even closer to crying - or perhaps she was already doing it. 'Promise me, 
Arnie. You have to promise me and then you have to do it. Then we . . . we can see. Promise 
me you'll get rid of that car. It's all I want from you, nothing else.' 
He closed his eyes and saw Leigh walking home from school. And a block down, idling at 
the kerb, was Christine. Waiting for her. 
He opened his eyes quickly, as if he had seen a friend in a dark room. 
'I can't do that,' he said. 
'Then we don't have much to talk about, do we?' 
'Yes! Yes, we do. We - ' 
'No. Goodbye, Arnie. I'll see you in school.'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'Leigh, wait!' 
Click. And dead smooth silence. 
A moment of nearly total rage came over him. He had a sudden deadly impulse to swing 
the black phone receiver around and around his head like an Argentinian bolas, shattering the 
glass in this goddam torture-chamber of a telephone booth. They had run out on him, all of 
them. Rats deserting a sinking ship. 
You have to be ready to help yourself before anyone else can help you. 
Fuck that bullshit! They were rats deserting a sinking ship. Not one of them, from that 
shitter Slawson with his thick horn -rimmed glasses and his weird poached-egg eyes to his 
rotten shitting old man who was so fucking pussywhipped that he ought to just give that cunt 
he was married to a razor and invite her to cut it off to that cheap bitch in her fancy house 
with her legs crossed probably she'd been having her period and that's why she choked on the 
goddam hamburger and those shitters with their fancy goddam cars and the boots full of golf-
clubs those goddam officers I'd like to bend them over this here lathe I'd play some golf with 
them I could find the right hole to put those little white balls in you bet your ass but when I 
get out of here no one's going to tell me what to do it's gonna be my way my way mine mine 
mine mine mine MINE - 
Arnie came back to himself suddenly, scared and wide-eyed, breathing hard. What had 
been happening to him? He had seemed like someone else there for a moment, someone on a 
crazed rant against humanity in general  
Not just someone. It was LeBay. 
No! That's not true at all! 
Leigh's voice: Isn't that the truth of it, Arnie? 
Suddenly something very like a vision rose in his tired, confused mind. He was hearing a 
minister's voice: Arnold, do you take this woman to be your loving - 
But it wasn't a church; it was a used-car lot with bright multicoloured plastic pennants 
fluttering in a stiff breeze. Camp chairs had been set up. It was Will Darnell's lot, and Will 
was standing beside him in the best man's position. There was no girl beside him. Christine 
was parked beside him, shining in a spring sun, even her whitewalls seeming to glow. 
His father's voice: Is there something going on ? 
The preacher's voice: Who giveth this woman to this man? 
Roland D. LeBay rose from one of the camp chairs like the prow of a skeletal ghost-ship 
from Hades. He was grinning - and for the first time Arnie saw who had been sitting around 
him: Buddy Repperton, Richie Trelawney, Moochie Welch. Richie Trelawney was black and 
charred, most of his hair burned off. Blood had poured down Buddy Repperton's chin and had</p>
      <p class="calibre3">caked his shirt like hideous vomit. But Moochie Welch was the worst; Moochie Welch had 
been ripped open like a laundry bag. They were smiling. All of them were smiling. 
I do, Roland D. LeBay croaked. He grinned, and a tongue slimed with graveyard mould 
lolled from the stinking hole of his mouth. I give her, and he's got the receipt to prove it. 
She's all his. The bitch is the ace of spades . . . and she's all his. 
* * * * * 
Arnie became aware that he was moaning in the telephone booth, clutching the receiver 
against his chest. With a tremendous effort he pulled himself all the way out of the daze - 
vision, whatever it had been - and got hold of himself. 
This time when he reached for the change on the ledge, he spilled half of it onto the floor. 
He plugged a dime into the slot and scrabbled through the telephone book until he found the 
hospital number. Dennis. Dennis would be there, Dennis always had been. Dennis wouldn't 
let him down. Dennis would help. 
The switchboard girl answered, and Arnie said, 'Room Two-forty, please.' 
The connection was made. The phone began to ring It rang . . . and rang . . . and rang. Just 
as he was about to give up, a brisk female voice said, 'Second floor, C-Wing, who were you 
trying to reach?' 
'Guilder,' Arnie said. 'Dennis Guilder.' 
'Mr Guilder's in Physical Therapy right now, the female voice said. 'You could reach him at 
eight o'clock.' 
Arnie thought of telling her it was important - very important - but suddenly he was 
overwhelmed with a need to get out of the phone booth. Claustrophobia was like a giant's 
hand pushing down on his chest. He could smell his own sweat. The smell was sour, bitter. 
'Sir?' 
'Yeah, okay, I'll call back,' Arnie said. He broke the connection and nearly burst out of the 
booth, leaving his change scattered on the ledge and the floor. A few people turned around to 
look at him, mildly interested, and then turned back to their food again. 
'Pizza's ready,' the counterman said. 
Arnie glanced up at the clock and saw he had been in the booth for almost twenty minutes. 
There was sweat all over his face. His armpits felt like a jungle. His legs were trembling - the 
muscles in his thighs felt as if they might simply give out and spill him onto the floor. 
He paid for the pizza, nearly dropping his wallet as he tucked his three dollars in change 
back in. 
'You okay?' the counterman asked. 'You look a little white around the gills.'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'I'm fine,' Arnie said. Now he felt as if he might vomit. He snatched the pizza in its white 
box with the word GINO'S emblazoned across the top and fled into the cold sharp clarity of 
the night. The last of the clouds had blown away, and the stars twinkled like chipped 
diamonds. He stood on the sidewalk for a moment, looking first at the stars and then at 
Christine, parked across the street, waiting faithfully. 
She would never argue or complain, Arnie thought. She would never demand. You could 
enter her anytime and rest on her plush upholstery, rest in her warmth. She would never deny. 
She - she - 
She loved him. 
Yes; he sensed that was true. Just as he sometimes sensed that LeBay would not have sold 
her to anyone else, not for two hundred and fifty, not for two thousand. She had been sitting 
there waiting for the right buyer. One who would . . . 
One who would love her for herself alone, that voice inside whispered. 
'Yes. That was it; that was exactly it. 
Arnie stood there with his pizza forgotten in his hands, white steam rising lazily from the 
grease-spotted box. He looked at Christine, and such a confusing whirl of emotions ran 
through him that there might have been a cyclone in his body, rearranging everything it did 
not simply destroy. Oh, he loved and loathed her, he hated her and cherished her, he needed 
her and needed to run from her, she was his and he was hers and 
(I now pronounce you man and wife joined and sealed from this day forth for ever and ever, 
until death do you part) 
But worst of all was the horror, the terrible numbing horror, the realization that . . . that . . . 
(how did you hurt your back that night, Arnie? after Repperton - the late Clarence 'Buddy' 
Repperton - and his buddies trashed her? How did you hurt your back so that now you have 
to wear this stinking brace all the time? How did you hurt your back?) 
The answer rose and Arnie began to run, trying to beat the realization, to get to Christine 
before he saw the whole thing plain and went mad. 
He ran for Christine, running his tangled emotions and some terrible drawing realization a 
foot race; he ran to her the way a hype runs for his works when the shakes and the jitters get 
so bad he can no longer think of anything but relief; he ran the way that the damned run to 
their appointed doom; he ran as a bridegroom runs to the place where his bride stands 
waiting. 
He ran because inside Christine none of these things mattered - not his mother, father, 
Leigh, Dennis, or what he had done to his back that night when everyone was gone, that night 
after he had taken his almost totally destroyed Plymouth from the airport and back to 
Darnell's, and after the place was empty he had put Christine's transmission in neutral and</p>
      <p class="calibre3">pushed her, pushed her until she began to roll on her flat tyres, pushed her until she was out 
the door and he could hear the wind of November keening sharply around the wrecks and the 
abandonded hulks with their stellated glass and their ruptured gas tanks; he had pushed her 
until the sweat ran off him in rivers and his heart thudded like a runaway horse in his chest 
and his back cried out for mercy; he bad pushed her, his body pumping as if in some hellish 
consummation; he had pushed her, and inside the milometer ran slowly backward, and some 
fifty feet beyond the door his back began to really throb, and he kept pushing, and then his 
back began to scream in protest, and he kept pushing, muscling it along on the flat, slashed 
tyres, his hands going numb, his back screaming, screaming, screaming. And then - 
He reached Christine and flung himself inside, shuddering and panting. His pizza fell on the 
floor. He picked it up and set it on the seat, feeling calm slowly wash through him like a 
soothing balm. He touched the steering wheel, let his hands slip down it, tracing its delicious 
curve. He took one glove off and felt in his pocket for his keys. For LeBay's keys. 
He could still remember what had happened that night, but it did not seem horrible now; 
now, sitting behind Christine's steering wheel, it seemed rather wonderful. 
It had been a miracle. 
He remembered how it had suddenly become easier to push the car because the tyres were 
healing themselves magically, kneading themselves together without a scar and then 
inflating. The broken glass had begun to re-assemble from nowhere, knitting itself upward 
with small, scratchy, crystalline sounds, The dents began to pop back out. 
He simply pushed her until she was right enough to run, and then he had driven her, 
cruising between the rows until the milometer ran back past what Repperton and his friends 
had done. And then Christine was okay. 
What could be so horrible about that? 
'Nothing,' a voice said. 
He looked around. Roland D. LeBay was sitting on the passenger side of the car, wearing a 
black double-breasted suit, a white shirt, a blue tie. A row of medals hung askew on one lapel 
of his suit-coat - it was the outfit he had been buried in, Arnie knew that even though he had 
never actually seen it. Only LeBay looked younger and tougher. A man you'd not want to 
fool with. 
'Start her up,' LeBay said. 'Get the heater going and let's motorvate.' 
'Sure,' Arnie said, and turned the key. Christine pulled out, tyres crunching on the packed 
snow. He had pushed her that night until almost all the damage had been repaired. No, not 
repaired - negated. Negated was the right word for what had happened. And then he had put 
her back in stall twenty, leaving the rest to do himself. 
'Let's have us some music,' the voice beside him said.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Arnie turned on the radio. Dion was singing' Donna the Prima Donna'. 
'You going to eat that pizza, or what?' The voice seemed to be changing somehow. 
'Sure,' Arnie said. 'You want apiece?' 
Leering: 'I never say no to a piece of anything.' Arnie opened the pizza box with one hand 
and pulled a piece free. 'Here you g - ' 
His eyes widened. The slice of pizza began to tremble, the long threads of cheese dangling 
down beginning to sway like the strands of a spiderweb broken by the wind. 
It wasn't LeBay sitting there anymore. 
It was him. 
It was Arnie Cunningham at roughly age fifty, not as old as LeBay had been when he and 
Dennis first met him on that August day, not that old, but getting there, friends and 
neighbours, getting there. His older self was wearing a slightly yellowed T-shirt and dirty, 
oil-smeared bluejeans. The glasses were hornrims, taped at one bow. The hair was cut short 
and receding. The grey eyes were muddy and bloodshot. The mouth had taken all the tucks of 
sour loneliness. Because this - this thing, apparition, whatever it was - it was alone. He felt 
that. 
Alone except for Christine. 
This version of himself and Roland D. LeBay could have been son and father: the 
resemblance was that great. 
'You going to drive? Or are you going to stare at me?' this thing asked, and it suddenly 
began to age before Arnie's stunned eyes. The iron-coloured hair went white, the T-shirt 
rippled and thinned, the body beneath twisted with age. The wrinkles raced across the face 
and then sank in like lines of acid. The eyes sank into their sockets and the corneas yellowed. 
Now only the nose thrust forward, and it was the face of some ancient carrion-eater, but still 
his face, oh, yes, still his. 
'See anything green?' this sept - no, this octogenarian 'Arnie Cunningham croaked, as its 
body twisted and writhed and withered on Christine's red seat. 'See anything green? See 
anything green? See anything - ' The voice cracked and rose and whined into a shrill, senile 
treble, and now the skin broke open in sores and surface tumours and behind the glasses 
milky cataracts covered both eyes like shades being pulled down. It was rotting before his 
very eyes and the smell of it was what he had smelled in Christine before, what Leigh had 
smelled, only it was worse now, it was the high, gassy, gagging smell of high-speed decay, 
the smell of his own death, and Arnie began to whine as Little Richard came on the radio 
singing 'Tutti Frutti,' and now the thing's hair was failing out in gossamer white drifts and its 
collarbones poked through the shiny, stretched skin above the T-shirt's sagging round collar, 
they poked through like grotesque white pencils. Its lips were shrivelling away from the final</p>
      <p class="calibre3">surviving teeth that leaned this way and that like tombstones, it was him, it was dead, and yet 
it lived - like Christine, it lived, 
'See anything green?' it gibbered. 'See anything green?' 
Arnie began to scream.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">39   JUNKINS AGAIN 
 
The fenders were clickin the guard-rail posts,                                                                                         
The guys beside me were just as white as ghosts.

The lines in the road just look like dots.' 
                                                - Charlie Ryan 
 
Arnie pulled into Da. nell's Garage about an hour later. His rider - if there really had been a 
rider - was long gone. The smell was gone too; it had undoubtedly been just an illusion. If 
you hung around the shitters for long enough, Arnie reasoned, everything started to smell like 
shit. And that made them happy, of course. 
Will was sitting behind his desk in his glassed-in office, eating a hoagie. He raised one 
drippy hand but didn't come out. Arnie blipped his horn and parked. 
It had all been some kind of dream. Simple as that. Some crazy kind of dream. Calling 
home, calling Leigh, trying to call Dennis and having that nurse tell him Dennis was in 
Physical Therapy - it was like being denied three times before the cock crew, or something. 
He had freaked a little bit. Anyone would have freaked, after the shitstorm he'd been through 
since August. It was all a question of perspective, after all, wasn't it? All his life he had been 
one thing to people, and now he was coming out of his shell, turning into a normal everyday 
person with normal everyday concerns. It was not at all surprising that people should resent 
this, because when someone changed 
(for better or worse, for richer or poorer) 
it was natural for people to get a little weird about it. It fucked up their perspective. 
Leigh has spoken as if she thought he was crazy, and that was nothing but bullshit of the 
purest ray serene. He had been under strain, of course he had, but strain was a natural part of 
life. If Miss High-Box-Oh-So-Preppy Leigh Cabot thought otherwise, she was in for an 
abysmal fucking at the hands of that all-time champion rapist, Life. She'd probably end up 
taking Big Reds to get out of first gear in the morning and Nembies or 'Ludes to come down 
at night. 
Ah, but he wanted her - even now, thinking about her, he felt a great, unaccountable, 
unnameable desire sweep through him like cold wind, making him squeeze Christine's wheel 
fiercely in his hands. It was a hot wanting too great, too elemental, for naming. It was its own 
force. 
But he was all right now. He felt he had . . . crossed the last bridge, or something.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">He had come back to himself sitting in the middle of a narrow access road beyond the 
farthest parking-lot reaches of the Monroeville Mail - which meant he was roughly halfway 
to California. Getting out, looking behind the car, he had seen a hole smashed through a 
snowbanks and there was melting snow sprayed across Christine's hood. Apparently he had 
lost control, gone skating across the lot (which, even with the Christmas shopping season in 
full swing, was mercifully empty this far out), and had crashed through the bank. Damn lucky 
he hadn't been in an accident. Damn lucky. 
He had sat there for a while, listening to the radio and looking through the windscreen at 
the half-moon floating overhead. Bobby Helms had come on singing 'Jingle Bell Rock', a 
Sound of the Season, as the deejays said, and he had smiled a little, feeling better. He couldn't 
remember what exactly it was that he had seen (or thought he had seen), and he didn't really 
want to. Whatever it had been, it was the first and last time. He was quite sure of that. People 
had gotten him imagining things. They'd probably be delighted if they knew . . . but he wasn't 
going to give them that satisfaction. 
Things were going to be better all the way 'around. He would mend his fences at home - in 
fact, could start tonight by watching some TV with his folks, just like in the old days. And he 
would win Leigh back. If she didn't like the car, no matter how weird her reasons were, fine. 
Maybe he would, even buy another car sometime soon and tell her he had traded Christine in. 
He could keep Christine-here, rent space. What she didn't know wouldn't hurt her. And Will. 
This was going to be his last run for Will, this coming weekend. That bullshit had gone just 
about far enough; he could feel it. Let Will think he was a chicken if that's what he wanted to 
think. A felony rap for interstate transport of unlicensed cigarettes and alcohol wouldn't look 
all that hot on his college application, would it? A Federal felony rap. No. Not too cool. 
He laughed a little. He did feel better. Purged. On his way over to the garage he ate his 
pizza even though it was cold. He was ravenous. It had struck him a bit peculiar that one 
piece was gone - in fact, it made him a bit uneasy - but he dismissed it. He had probably eaten 
it during that strange blank period, or maybe even thrown it out the window. Whoo, that had 
been spooky. No more of that shit. And he had laughed again, this time a little less shakily. 
Now be got out of the car, slammed the door, and started toward Will's office to find out 
what he had for him to do this evening. It suddenly occurred to him that tomorrow was the 
last day of school before the Christmas vacation, and that put an extra spring in his step. 
That was when the side door, the one beside the big carport door, opened and a man let 
himself in. It was Junkins. Again. 
He saw Arnie looking at him and raised a hand. 'Hi, Arnie.' 
Arnie glanced at Will. Through the glass, Will shrugged and went on eating his hoagie. 
'Hello,' Arnie said. 'What can I do for you?' 
'Well, I don't know,' Junkins said. He smiled, and then his eyes slid past Arnie to Christine, 
appraising, looking for damage. 'Do you want to do something for me?'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'Not fucking likely,' Arnie said. He could feel his head starting to throb with rage again. 
Rudy Junkins smiled, apparently unoffended. 
'I just dropped by. How you been?' 
He stuck out his hand. Arnie only looked at it. Not embarrassed in the slightest, Junkins 
dropped his hand, walked around to Christine, and began examining her again. Arnie watched 
him, his lips pressed together so tightly they were white. He felt a fresh pulse of anger each 
time Junkins dropped one of his hands onto Christine. 
'Look, maybe you ought to buy a season ticket or something,' Arnie said. 'Like to the 
Steelers games.' 
Junkins turned and looked at him questioningly. 
'Never mind,' Arnie said sullenly. 
Junkins went on looking. 'You know,' he said, it's a hell of a strange thing, what happened 
to Buddy Repperton and those other two boys, isn't it?' 
Fuck it, Arnie thought. I'm not going to fool around with this shitter. 
'I was in Philadelphia. Chess tourney.' 
'I know,' Junkins said. 
'Jesus! You're really checking me out!' 
Junkins walked back to Arnie. There was no smile on his face now. 'Yes, that's right,' he 
said. 'I'm checking you out. Three of the boys I believe were involved in vandalizing your car 
are now dead, along with a fourth boy who was apparently just along for the ride on Tuesday 
night. That's a pretty big coincidence. It's nine miles too big for me. You bet I'm checking 
you out.' 
Arnie stared at him, surprised out of his anger, uncertain. 'I thought it was an accident . . . 
that they were liquored up and speeding and - ' 
'There was another car involved,' Junkins said. 
'How do you know that?' 
'There were tracks in the snow, for one thing. Unfortunately, the wind had blurred them too 
much for us to be able to get a decent photo. But one of the barriers at the Squantic Hills 
State Park gate was broken, and we found traces of red paint on it. Buddy's Camaro wasn't 
red. It was blue.' 
He measured Arnie with his eyes.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'We also found traces of red paint embedded in Moochie Welch's skin, Arnie. Can you dig 
that? Embedded. Do you know how hard a car has to hit a guy to embed paint in his skin?' 
'You ought to go out there and start counting red cars,' Arnie said coldly. 'You'll be up to 
twenty before you get to Basin Drive, I guarantee it.' 
'You bet,' Junkins said. 'But we sent our samples to the FBI lab in Washington, where they 
have samples of every shade of paint they ever used in Detroit. We got the results back today. 
Any idea what they were? Want to guess?' 
Arnie's heart was thudding dully in his chest; there was a corresponding beat at his temples. 
'Since you're here, I'd guess it was Autumn Red. Christine's colour.' 
'Give that man a Kewpie doll,' Junkins said. He lit a cigarette and looked at Arnie through 
the smoke. He had abandoned any pretence of good humour; his gaze was stony. 
Arnie clapped his hands to his head in an exaggerated gesture of exasperation. 'Autumn 
Red, great. Christine's a custom job but there were Fords from 1959 to 1963 painted Autumn 
Red, and Thunderbirds, and Chevrolet offered that shade from 1962 to 1964, and for a while 
in the mid-fifties you could get a Rambler painted Autumn Red. I've been working on my '58 
for half a year now, I get the car books; you can't do work on an old car without the books, or 
you're screwed before you start. Autumn Red was a popular choice. I know it' - he looked at 
Junkins fixedly - 'and you know it, too. Don't you?' 
Junkins said nothing; he only went on looking at Arnie in that fixed, stony, unsettling way. 
Arnie had never seen looked at in that way by anyone in his life, but he recognized the gaze, 
He supposed anyone would. It was a took of strong, frank suspicion. It scared him. A few 
months ago - even a few weeks ago - that was probably all it would have done. But now it 
made him furious as well. 
'You re really reaching. Just what the hell have you got against me anyway, Mr Junkins? 
Why are you on my ass?' Junkins laughed and walked around in a large half-circle. The place 
was entirely empty except for the two of them out here and Will in his office, finishing his 
hoagie and licking olive oil off his hands and still watching them closely. 
'What have I got against you?' He said. 'How does first-degree murder sound to you, Arnie? 
Does that grab you with any force?' 
Arnie grew very still. 
'Don't worry,' Junkins said, still walking. 'No big tough cop scene. No menacing threats 
about going downtown - except in this case downtown would be Harrisburg. No Miranda 
card. Everything is still fine for our hero, Arnold Cunningham.' 
'I don't understand any of what you're - ' 
'You . . . understand. PLENTY!' Junkins roared at him. He had stopped next to a giant 
yellow hulk of a truck - another of Johnny Pomberton's dumpsters-in-the-making. He stared</p>
      <p class="calibre3">at Arnie. 'Three of the kids who beat on your car are dead. Autumn Red paint samples were 
taken at both crime scenes, leading us to believe that the vehicle the perpetrator used in both 
cases was at least in part Autumn Red. And gee whiz! It just turns out that the car those kids 
trashed is mostly Autumn Red. And you stand there and push your glasses up on your nose 
and tell me you don't understand what I'm talking about.' 
'I was in Philadelphia when it happened,' Arnie said quietly. 'Don't you get that? Don't you 
get that at all?' 
'Kiddo,' Junkins said flipping his cigarette away, 'that's the worst part of it. That's the part 
that really stinks.' 
'I wish you'd get out of here or put me under arrest or something. Because I'm supposed to 
punch in and do some work.' 
'For now,' Junkins said, 'talk is all I've got. The first time - when Welch got killed - you 
were supposed to be home in bed.' 
'Pretty thin, I know,' Arnie said. 'Believe me, if I'd known this shit was going to come down 
on my head, I would have hired a sick friend to sit up with me.' 
'Oh, no - that was good,' Junkins said. 'Your mother and father had no cause to doubt your 
tale. I could tell that from speaking to them. And alibis - the true ones - usually have more 
holes than a Salvation Army suit. It's when they start to look like suits of armour that I get 
nervous.' 
'Holy Jumping Jesus!' Arnie almost screamed. 'It was a fucking chess meet! I've been in the 
chess club for four years now!' 
Until today,' Junkins said, and Arnie grew still again. Junkins nodded. 'Oh yeah, I talked to 
the club advisor. Herbert Slawson. He says that the first three years you never missed a 
meeting, even came to a couple with a low-grade case of the flu. You were his star player. 
Then, this year, you were spotty right from the start - ' 
'I had my car to work on . . . and I got a girl - ' 
'He said you missed the first three tourneys, and he was pretty surprised when your name 
turned up on the trip sheet for the Northern States meet. He thought you'd lost all your 
interest in the club.' 
'I told you - ' 
'Yes, you did. Too busy. Cars and girls, just what makes most kids too busy. But you 
regained your interest long enough to go to Philly - and then you dropped out. That strikes me 
as very odd.' 
'I can't see anything funny about it,' Arnie said, but his voice seemed distant, almost lost in 
the surf-roar of blood in his ears.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'Bullshit. It looks as if you knew it was coming down and set yourself up with an airtight 
alibi.' 
The roar in his head had even assumed the steady, wavelike beats of surf, each beat 
accompanied by a dull thrust of pain. He was getting a headache - why wouldn't this 
monstrous man with his prying brown eyes just go away? None of it was true, none of it, He 
hadn't set anything up, not an alibi, not anything. He had been as surprised as anyone else 
when he read in the paper what had happened. Of course he had been. There was nothing 
strange going on, unless it was this lunatic's paranoia, and 
(how did you hurt your back anyway, Arnie? and by the way, do you see anything green? 
do you see) 
he closed his eyes and for a moment the world seemed to lurch out of its orbit and he saw 
that green, grinning, rotting face floating before him, saying: Start her up. Get the heater 
going and let's motorvate. And while we're at it, let's get the shitters that wrecked our car. 
Let's grease the little cockknockers, kid, what do you say? Let's hit them so fucking hard the 
corpse-cutter down at city, hospital will have to pull the paint-chips out of their carcasses 
with pliers. What do you say? Find some doowop music on the radio and let's cruise. Let's - 
He groped back behind him, touched Christine - her hard, cool, reassuring surface - and 
things dropped back into place again. He opened his eyes. 
'There's only one other thing, really,' Junkins said, 'and it's very subjective. Nothing you 
could put on a report. You're different this time, Arnie. Harder, somehow. It's almost as if 
you've put on twenty years.' 
Arnie laughed, and was relieved to hear it sounded quite natural. 'Mr Junkins, you've got a 
screw loose.' 
Junkins didn't join him in his laughter. 'Uh-huh. I know it. The whole thing is screwy - 
screwier than anything I've investigated in the ten years I've been a detective. Last time, I felt 
like I could reach you, Arnie. I felt you were . . . I don't know. Lost, unhappy, groping 
around, trying to get out. Now I don't feel that at all. I almost feel like I'm talking to a 
different person. Not a very nice one.' 
'I'm done-talking to you,' Arnie said abruptly, and began walking toward the office. 
'I want to know what happened,' Junkins called after him. 'And I'm going to find out. 
Believe me.' 
'Do me a favour and stay away from here,' Arnie said. 'You're crazy.' 
He let himself into the office, closed the door behind him, and noticed his hands weren't 
shaking at all. The room was stuffy with the smells of cigar and olive oil and garlic. He 
crossed in front of Will without speaking, took his time-card out of the rack, and punched in: 
ka-thud. Then he looked through the glass window and saw Junkins standing there, looking at</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Christine. Will said nothing. Arnie could hear the noisy engine of the big man's respiration. A 
couple of minutes later Junkins left. 
'Cop,' Will said, and ripped out a long belch. It sounded like a chainsaw. 
'Yeah.' 
'Repperton?' 
'Yeah. He thinks I had something to do with it.' 
'Even though you were in Philly?' 
Arnie shook his head. 'He doesn't even seem to care about that.' 
He's a smart cop then, Will thought. He knows the facts are wrong, and his intuition tells 
him there's something even wronger than that, so he's gotten further with it than most cops 
ever would, but he could spend a million years and not get all the way to the truth. He 
thought of the empty car driving itself into stall twenty like some weird wind-up toy. The 
empty ignition slot turning over to START, The engine revving once, like a warning snarl, 
and then failing off. 
And thinking of these things, Will did not trust himself to look Arnie in the face, even 
though his own experience in routine deceit was nearly lifelong. 
'I don't want to send you to Albany if the cops are watching you.' 
'I don't care if you send me to Albany or not, but you don't have to worry about the heat. 
He's the only cop I've seen, and he's crazy. He's not interested in anything but two cases of 
hit-and-run.' 
Now Will's eyes did meet Arnie's: Arnie's grey and distant, Will's a faded no-colour, the 
corneas a dim yellow; they were the eyes of an ancient tomcat who has seen a thousand mice 
turned inside out. 
'He's interested in you,' he said. 'I'd better send Jimmy.' 
'You like the way Jimmy drives, do you?' 
Will looked at Arnie for a moment and then sighed. Okay,' he said. 'But if you see that cop, 
you back off. And if you get caught holding a bag, Cunningham, it's your bag. Do you 
understand that?' 
'Yes,' Arnie said. 'Do you want me to do some work tonight, or what?' 
'There's a '77 Buick in forty-nine. Pull the starter motor. Check the solenoid. If it seems 
okay, pull that too.' 
Arnie nodded and left. Will's thoughtful eyes drifted from his retreating back to Christine. 
He had no business sending him to Albany this weekend and he knew it. The kid knew it too,</p>
      <p class="calibre3">but he was going to push ahead anyway. He had said he'd go, and he was now going to by-
God do it. And if anything happened, the kid would stand up. Will was sure of it. There was a 
time when he surely wouldn't have done, but that time was past now. 
He had heard it all on the intercom. 
Junkins had been right. 
The kid was harder now. 
Will began to look at the kid's '58 again. Arnie would be taking Will's Chrysler to New 
York. While he was gone, Will would watch Christine. He would watch Christine and see 
what happened.</p>

                                       - The Beach Boys 
 
Rudolph Junkins and Rick Mercer of the Pennsylvania State Police detective division sat 
drinking coffee the following afternoon in a glum little office with paint peeling from the 
walls. Outside, a depressing mixture of snow and sleet was falling. 
'I'm pretty sure this is going to be the weekend,' Junkins said. 'That Chrysler has rolled 
every four or five weeks for the last eight months.' 
'Just understand that busting Darnell and whatever bee you've got in your bonnet about that 
kid are two different things.' 
'They're both the same thing to me,' Junkins replied. 'The kid knows something. If I get him 
rattled, I may find out what it is.' 
'You think he had an accomplice? Someone who used his car and killed those kids while he 
was at the chess tourney?' 
Junkins shook his head. 'No, goddammit. The kid has got exactly one good friend, and he's 
in the hospital. I don't know what I think, except that the car was involved . . . and he was 
involved too.' 
Junkins put his Styrofoam coffee cup down and pointed at the man on the other side of the 
desk. 
'Once we get that place closed down, I want a six-pack of lab technicians to go over it from 
stem to stern, inside and out. I want it up on a lift, I want it checked for dents bumps, repaint . 
. . and for blood. That's what I really want, Rick. Just one drop of blood.' 
'You don't like that kid much, do you?' Rick asked. 
Junkins uttered a bewildered little laugh. 'You know, the first time I kind of did. I liked him 
and I felt sorry for him. I felt like maybe he was covering for somebody else who had 
something on him. But this time I didn't like him at all.' He considered.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'And I didn't like that car, either. The- way he kept touching it every time I thought I had 
him on the ropes. It was spooky.' 
Rick said, 'As long as you remember that Darnell is the guy I've got to bust. No one in 
Harrisburg has the slightest interest in your kid.' 
'I'll remember,' Junkins said. He picked up his coffee again and looked at Rick grimly. 
'Because he's a means to the end. I'm going to nail the person who killed those kids if it's the 
last thing I ever do.' 
'It may not even go down this weekend,' Rick said. 
But it did. 
* * * * * 
Two plainclothes cops from Pennsylvania's State Felony Squad sat in the cab of a four-
year-old Datsun pickup on the morning of Saturday, December 16, watching as Will Darnell's 
black Chrysler rolled out of the big door and into the street. A light drizzle was failing; it was 
not quite cold enough to be sleet. It was one of those misty days when it is impossible to tell 
where the lowering clouds end and the actual mist begins. The Chrysler was quite properly 
showing its parking lights. Arnie Cunningham was a safe driver. 
One of the plainclothesmen lifted a walkie-talkie to his mouth and spoke into it. He just 
came out in Darnell's car. You guys stay on your toes.' 
They followed the Chrysler to I-76. When they saw Arnie get on the eastbound ramp with 
its Harrisburg sign, they turned up the westbound ramp, toward Ohio, and reported. They 
would get off I-76 one exit down the line and return to their original position near Darnell's 
Garage. 
'Okay Junkins voice came back let's make an omelette.' 
* * * * * 
Twenty minutes later, as Arnie was cruising east at a sedate and legal 50, three cops with all 
the right paperwork in hand knocked on the door of William Upshaw, who lived in the very 
much upscale suburb of Sewickley. Upshaw answered the door in his bathrobe. From behind 
came the cartoon squawks of Saturday-morning TV. 
'Who is it, honey?' his wife called from the kitchen. 
Upshaw looked at the papers, which were court orders and felt that he might faint. One 
ordered that all of Upshaw's tax records relating to Will Darnell (an individual) and Will 
Darnell (a corporation) be impounded. These papers bore the signature of the Pennsylvania 
Attorney General and a Superior Court judge. 
'Who is it, hon?' his wife asked again, and one of his kids came to look, all big eyes.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Upshaw tried to speak and could raise only a dusty croak. It had come. He had dreamed 
about it, and it had finally come, The house in Sewickley had not protected him from it; the 
woman he kept at a safe distance in King of Prussia had not protected him from it; it was 
here: he read it in the smooth faces of these cops in their off-the-rack Anderson Little suits. 
Worst of all, one of them was Federal - Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. He produced a 
second ID, proclaiming him an agent of something called the Federal Drug Control Task 
Force. 
'Our information is that you keep an office in your home,' the Federal cop said. He looked - 
what? Twenty-six? Thirty? Had he ever had to worry about what you were going to do when 
you had three kids and a wife who liked nice things maybe a little too much? Bill Upshaw 
didn't think so. When you had those things to think about, your face didn't stay that smooth. 
Your face only stayed that smooth when you could indulge in the luxury of grand thoughts - 
law and order, right and wrong, good guys and bad guys. 
He opened his mouth to answer the Federal cop's question and produced only another dusty 
croak. 
'Is this information correct?' the Federal cop asked patiently. 
'Yes,' Bill Upshaw croaked. 
'And another office at 100 Frankstown Road in Monroeville?' 
'Yes.' 
'Hon, who is it?' Amber asked, and came into the hallway. She saw the three men standing 
on the stoop and pulled the neck of her housecoat closed. The cartoons blared. 
Upshaw thought suddenly, almost with relief, It's the end of everything. 
The kid who had come out to see who had come to visit so early on a Saturday morning 
suddenly burst into tears and fled for the safety of the SuperFriends on channel 4. 
* * * * * 
When Rudy Junkins received the news that Upshaw had been served and that all the papers 
pertaining to Darnell, both at Upshaw's Sewickley home and his Monroeville office, had been 
impounded, he led half a dozen state cops in what he supposed would have been called a raid 
in the old days. Even during the holiday season the garage was moderately busy on Saturday 
(although it was by no means the bustling place it became on summer weekends), and when 
Junkins raised a battery-powered loudhailer to his lips and began to use it, perhaps two dozen 
heads whipped around. They would have conversation enough out of this to last them into the 
new year. 
'This is the Pennsylvania State Police!' Junkins cried into the loudhailer. The words echoed 
and bounced. He found, even at this instant, that his eyes were drawn to the white-over-red 
Plymouth sitting empty in stall twenty. He had handled half a dozen murder weapons in his</p>
      <p class="calibre3">time, sometimes at the scene, more frequently in the witness box, but just looking at that car 
made him feel cold. 
Gitney, the IRS man who had come along for this particular sleigh-ride, was frowning at 
him to go on. None of you know what this is about. None of you. But he raised the loudhailer 
to his lips again. 
'This place of business is closed! I repeat, this place of business is closed! You may take 
your vehicles if they are in running order - if not, please leave quickly and quietly! This place 
is closed!'  
The loudhailer made an amplified click as he turned it off. 
He looked toward the office and saw that Will Darnell was talking on the telephone, an 
unlit cigar jammed in his face. Jimmy Sykes was standing by the Coke machine, his simple 
face a picture of confused dismay - he didn't look much different from Bill Upshaw's kid at 
the moment before he burst into tears. 
* * * * * 
'Do you understand your rights as I have read them to you?' The cop in charge was Rick 
Mercer. Behind them, the garage was empty except for four uniformed cops, who were doing 
paperwork on the cars which had been impounded when the garage was closed. 
'Yeah,' Will said. His face was composed; the only sign of his upset was his deepening 
wheeze, the fast rise and fall of his big chest under his open-,throated white shirt, the way he 
held his aspirator constantly in one hand. 
'Do you have anything to say to us at this time?' Mercer asked. 
'Not until my lawyer gets here.' 
'Your lawyer can meet us in Harrisburg,' Junkins said. 
Will glanced at Junkins contemptuously and said nothing. Outside, more uniformed police 
had finished affixing seals to every door and window of the garage except for the small side 
door. Until the state of impound ceased, all traffic would use that door. 
'This is the craziest thing I ever heard of,' Will Darnell said at last. 
'It'll get crazier,' Mercer said, smiling sincerely. 'You're going away for a very long time, 
Will. Maybe someday they'll put you in charge of the prison motor pool.' 
'I know you,' Will said, looking at him. 'Your name is Mercer. I knew your father well. He 
was the crookedest cop that ever came out of King's County.' 
The blood fell out of Rick Mercer's face and he raised his hand. 
'Stop it, Rick,' Junkins said.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'Sure,' Will said. 'You guys have your fun. Make your jokes about the prison motor pool. I'll 
be back here doing business in two weeks. And if you don't know it, you're even stupider than 
you look.' 
He glanced around at them, his eyes intelligent, sardonic . . . and trapped. Abruptly he 
raised his aspirator to his mouth and breathed in deeply. 
"Get this bag of shit out of here,' Mercer said. He was still white. 
* * * * * 
'Are you all right?' Junkins asked. They were sitting in an unmarked state Ford half an hour 
later. The sun had decided to come out and shone blindingly on melting snow and wet streets. 
Darnell's Garage sat silent. Darnell's records - and Cunningham's street-rod Plymouth - were 
safely penned up inside. 
'That crack he made about my father,' Mercer said heavily. 'My father shot himself, Rudy. 
Blew his head off. And I always thought . . . in college I read . . .' He shrugged. 'Lots of cops 
eat the gun. Melvin Purvis did it, you know. He was the man who got Dillinger. But you 
wonder.' Mercer lit a cigarette and drew smoke downstairs in a long, shuddery breath. 
'He didn't know anything,' Junkins said. 
'The fuck he didn't,' Mercer said. He unrolled his window and threw the cigarette out. He 
unclipped the mike under the dash. 'Home, this is Mobile Two.' 
'Ten-four, Mobile Two.' 
'What's happening with our carrier pigeon?' 
'He's on Interstate Eighty-four coming up on Port Jervis.' Port Jervis was the crossover 
point between Pennsylvania and New York. 
'New York is all ready?' 
'Affirmative.' 
'You tell them again that I want him northeast of Middletown before they grab him, and his 
toll-ticket taken in evidence.' 
'Ten-four.' 
Mercer put the mike back and smiled thinly. 'Once he crosses into New York, there's not a 
question in the world about it being Federal - but we've still got first dibs. Isn't that beautiful?' 
Junkins didn't answer. There was nothing beautiful about it - from Darnell with his 
aspirator to Mercer's father eating his gun, there was nothing beautiful about it. Junkins was 
filled with a spooky feeling of inevitability, a feeling that the ugly things were not ending but 
only just beginning to happen. He felt halfway through a dark story that might prove too 
terrible to finish. Except he had to finish it now, didn't he? Yes.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">The terrible feeling, the terrible image persisted: that the first time he had talked to Arnie 
Cunningham, he had been talking to a drowning man, and the second time he had talked to 
him, the drowning had happened - and he was talking to a corpse. 
The cloud cover over western New York was breaking, and Arnie's spirits began to rise. It 
always felt good to get away from Libertyville, away from . . . from everything. Not even the 
knowledge that he had contraband in the boot could quench that feeling of lift. And at least it 
wasn't dope this time. Far in the back of his mind - hardly even acknowledged, but there - 
was the idle speculation about how things would be different and how his life would change 
if he just dumped the cigarettes and kept on going. If he just left the entire depressing mess 
behind. 
But of course he wouldn't. Leaving Christine after he had put so much into her was of 
course impossible. 
He turned up the radio and hummed along with something current. The sun, weakened by 
December but still trying to be bold, broke cover entirely and Arnie grinned. 
He was still grinning when the New York State Police car pulled up beside him in the 
passing lane and paced him. The loudspeaker on top began to chant, 'This is for the Chrysler! 
Pull over, Chrysler! Pull over!' 
Arnie looked over, the grin fading from his lips. He stared into a pair of black sunglasses. 
Copglasses. The terror that seized him was deeper than he would have believed any emotion 
could be - and it wasn't for himself. His mouth went totally dry. His mind went into a blurring 
overdrive. He saw himself tramping the gas pedal and running for it, and perhaps he would 
have done it if he had been driving Christine . . . but he wasn't. He saw Will Darnell telling 
him that if he got caught holding a bag, it was his bag. Most of all he saw Junkins, Junkins 
with his sharp brown eyes, and knew this was Junkins's doing. 
He wished Rudolph Junkins was dead. 
'Pull over, Chrysler! I'm not talking to hear my own voice! Pull over right now!' 
Can't say anything, Arnie thought incoherently as he veered over into the breakdown lane. 
His balls were crawling, his stomach churning madly. He could see his own eyes in the 
rearview, wall-eyed with fear behind his glasses - not for him, though. Not for him. Christine. 
He was afraid for Christine. What they might do to Christine. 
His panic-stricken mind spun up a kaleidoscope of jumbled images. College application 
forms with the words REJECTED - CONVICTED FELON stamped across them. Prison bars, 
blued steel. A judge bending down from a high bench, his face white and accusing. Big bull 
queers in a prison yard looking for fresh meat. Christine riding the conveyor into the car-
crusher in the junkyard behind the garage.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">And then, as he stopped the Chrysler and put it in park, the State Police car pulling in 
behind him (and another, appearing like magic, pulling in ahead of him), a thought came 
from nowhere, full of cold comfort: Christine can take care of herself. 
Another thought came as the cops got out and came toward him, one holding a search 
warrant in his hand. It also seemed to come from nowhere, but it reverberated in Roland D. 
LeBay's raspy, old man's tones: 
And she'll take care of you, boy. All you got to do is go on believing in her and she'll take 
care of you. 
Arnie opened the car door and got out a moment before one of the cops could open it. 
'Arnold Richard Cunningham? one of the cops asked. 'Yes, indeed,' Arnie said calmly. 'Was 
I speeding?' 
'No, son,' one of the others said. 'But you are in a world of hurt, all the same.' 
The first cop stepped forward as formally as a career Army officer. 'I have a duly executed 
document here permitting the search of this 1966 Chrysler Imperial in the name of the People 
of New York State and of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and of the United States of 
America. Further 
'Well, that just about covers the motherfucking waterfront, doesn't it?' Arnie said. His back 
flared dully, and he jammed his hands against it. 
The cop's eyes widened slightly at the old voice coming out of this kid, but then he went on. 
'Further, to seize any contraband found in the course of this search in the name of the 
People of New York State and of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and of the United 
States of America.' 
'Fine,' Arnie said. None of it seemed real. Blue lights flashed a confusion. People passing in 
their cars turned to look, but he found he had no desire to turn from them, to hide his face, 
and that was something of a relief. 
'Give me the keys, kid,' one of the cops said. 
'Why don't you just get them yourself, you shitter?' Arnie said. 
'You're not helping yourself, kiddo,' the cop said, but he looked startled and a little fearful 
all the same; for a moment the kid's voice had deepened and roughened and he had sounded 
forty years older and a pretty tough customer - nothing like the skinny runt he saw before him 
at all. 
He leaned in, got the keys, and three of the cops immediately headed for the boot. They 
know, Arnie thought, resigned. At least this had nothing to do with Junkins's obsession with 
Buddy Repperton and Moochie Welch and the others (at least not directly, he amended</p>
      <p class="calibre3">cautiously); this smelled like a well-planned and well-coordinated operation against Will's 
smuggling operations from Libertyville into New York and New England. 
'Kid,' one of the cops said, 'would you like to answer some questions or make a statement? 
If you think you would, I'll read you the Miranda right now.' 
'No,' Arnie said calmly. 'I don't have anything to say.' 
'Things could go a lot easier with you.' 
'That's coercion,' Arnie said, smiling a little. 'Watch out or you'll put a big fat hole in your 
own case.' 
The cop flushed. 'If you want to be an asshole, that's your lookout.' 
The Chrysler boot was open. They bad pulled out the spare tyre, the jack, and several boxes 
of small parts springs, nuts, bolts, and the like. One of the cops was almost entirely in the 
boot; only his blue-grey-clad legs stuck out. For a moment Arnie hoped vaguely that they 
wouldn't find the under-compartment; then he dismissed the thought - it was just the childish 
part of him, the part he now wished burned away, because all that part of him did lately was 
hurt. They would find it. The quicker they found it, the quicker this nasty roadside scene 
would end. 
As if some god had heard his wish and decided to grant it posthaste, the cop in the boot 
called triumphantly, 'Cigarettes!' 
'All right,' the cop who had read the warrant said. 'Close it up.' He turned to Arnie and read 
him the Miranda warning. 'Do you understand your rights as I have read them to you?' 
'Yes,' Arnie said. 
'Do you want to make a statement?' 
'No.' 
'Get in the car, son. You're under arrest.' 
I'm under arrest, Arnie thought, and almost brayed laughter, the thought was so foolish. 
This was all a dream and he would wake up soon. Under arrest. Being hustled to a State 
Police cruiser. People looking at him - 
Desperate, childish tears, hot salt, welled up in his throat and closed it. 
His chest hitched - once, twice. 
The cop who had read him his rights touched his shoulder and Arnie shrugged it off with a 
kind of desperation. He felt that if he could get deep down inside himself quickly enough, he 
would be okay - but sympathy might drive him mad, 
'Don't touch me!'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'You do it the way you want to do it, son,' the cop said, removing his hand. He opened the 
cruiser's rear door for Arnie and handed him in. 
Do you cry in dreams? Of course you could - hadn't he read about people waking up from 
sad dreams with tears on their cheeks? But, dream or no dream, he wasn't going to cry. 
Instead he would think of Christine. Not of his mother or father, not of Leigh or Will 
Darnell, not of Slawson - all the miserable shitters who had betrayed him. 
He would think of Christine. 
Arnie closed his eyes and leaned his pale, gaunt face, forward into his hands and did just 
that. And as always, thinking about Christine made things better. After a while he was able to 
straighten up and look out at the passing scenery and think about his position. 
* * * * * 
Michael Cunningham put the telephone back into its cradle slowly - with infinite care - as if 
to do less might cause it to explode and spray his upstairs study with jagged black hooks of 
shrapnel. 
He sat back in the swivel chair behind his desk, on which there sat his IBM Correcting 
Selectric II typewriter, an ashtray with the blue-and-gold legend HORLICKS UNIVERSITY 
barely legible across the dirty bottom, and the manuscript of his third book, a study of the 
ironclads Monitor and Merrimac. He had been halfway through a page when the telephone 
rang. Now he flipped the paper release on the right side of the typewriter and pulled the page 
bonelessly out from under the roller, observing its slight curve clinically. He put it down on 
top of the manuscript, which was now little more than a jungle of pencilled-in corrections. 
Outside, a cold wind whined around the house. The morning's cloudy warmth had given 
way to a frigid, clear December evening. The earlier melt had frozen tight, and his son was 
being held in Albany on charges of what amounted to smuggling: no Mr Cunningham it is not 
marijuana it is cigarettes, two hundred cartons of Winston cigarettes with no tax stamps. 
From downstairs he could hear the whir of Regina's sewing machine. He would have to get 
up now, go to the door and open it, go down the hall to the stairs, walk down the stairs, walk 
into the dining room, then into the plant-lined little room that had once been a laundry but 
which was now a sewing room, and stand there while Regina looked up at him (she would be 
wearing her half-glasses for the close work), and say 'Regina, Arnie has been arrested by the 
New York State Police.' 
Michael attempted to begin this process by getting up from his desk chair, but the chair 
seemed to sense he was temporarily off-guard. It swivelled and rolled backward on its casters 
at the same moment, and Michael had to clutch the edge of his desk to keep from failing. He 
slipped heavily back into the chair, heart thudding with painful rapidity in his chest. 
He was struck suddenly by such a complex wave of despair and sorrow that he groaned 
aloud and grabbed his forehead, squeezing his temples. The old thoughts swarmed back in, as</p>
      <p class="calibre3">predictable as summer mosquitoes and just as maddening. Six months ago, things had been 
okay. Now his son was sitting in a jail cell somewhere. What were the watershed moments? 
How could he, Michael, have changed things? What was the history of it, exactly? Where had 
the sickness started to creep in? 
'Jesus - ' 
He squeezed harder, listening to the winter-whine outside the windows. He and Arnie had 
put the storms on just last month. That had been a good day, hadn't it? First Arnie holding the 
ladder and looking up, then him down and Arnie up there, him shouting for Arnie to be 
careful, the wind in his hair and dead brown leaves blowing over his shoes, their colours 
gone. Sure, it had been a good day. Even after that beastly car had come, seeming to 
overshadow everything in their son's life like a fatal disease, there had been some good days. 
Hadn't there? 
'Jesus,' he said again in a weak, teary voice that he despised. 
Unbidden images rose behind his eyes. Colleagues looking at him sideways, maybe 
whispering in the faculty club. Discussions at cocktail parties in which his name bobbed 
uneasily up and down like a waterlogged body. Arnie wouldn't be eighteen for almost two 
months and he supposed that meant his name couldn't be printed in the paper, but everyone 
would still know. Word got around. 
Suddenly, crazily, be saw Arnie at four, astride a red trike he and Regina had gotten at a 
rummage sale (Arnie at four had called them 'Momma's rubbage sales'). The trike's red paint 
was flaked with scales of rust, the tyres were bald, but Arnie had loved it; he would have 
taken that trike to bed with him, if he could. Michael closed his eyes and saw Arnie riding up 
and down the sidewalk, wearing his blue corduroy jumper, his hair flopping in his eyes, and 
then his mind's eye blinked or wavered or did something and the rusty rubbage-sale trike was 
Christine, her red paint scummed with rust, her windows milky-white with age. 
He gritted his teeth together. Someone looking in might have thought he was smiling 
crazily. He waited until he had some kind of control, and then got up and went downstairs to 
tell Regina what had happened. He would tell her and she would think of what they were 
going to do, just as she always had; she would steal the forward motion from him, taking 
whatever sorry balm that actually doing things had to give, and leave him with only sick 
sorrow and the knowledge that now his son was someone else.</p>

STORM

The first of that winter's great northeast storms came to Libertyville on Christmas Eve, 
beating its way across the upper third of the US, on a wide and easily predictable storm track. 
The day began in bright thirty-degree sunshine, but morning deejays were already cheerfully 
predicting doom and gloom, urging those who had not finished their last-minute shopping to 
do so by mid-afternoon. Those planning trips to the old homestead for an old-fashioned 
Christmas were urged to rethink their plans if the trip could not be made in four to six hours. 
'If you don't want to be spending Christmas Day in the breakdown lane of I-76 somewhere 
between Bedford and Carlisle, I'd leave early or not at all,' the FM-104 jock advised his 
listening audience (a large part of which was too stoned to even consider going anyplace), 
and then resumed the Christmas Block Party with Springsteen's version of 'Santa Claus Is 
Coming to Town'. 
By 11:00 AM, when Dennis Guilder finally left Libertyville Community Hospital (as per 
hospital regulations, he was not allowed on his crutches until he was actually out of the 
building; until then he was pushed along in a wheelchair by Elaine), the sky had begun to 
scum over with clouds and there was an eerie fairy ring around the sun. Dennis crossed the 
parking lot carefully on his crutches, his mother and father bookending him nervously in spite 
of the fact that the lot had been scrupulously salted free of even the slightest trace or snow 
and ice He paused by the family car, turning his face up slightly into the freshening breeze. 
Being outside was like a resurrection. He felt he could stand here for hours and not have 
enough of it. 
* * * * * 
By one o'clock that afternoon, the Cunningham family station wagon had reached the 
outskirts of Ligonier, ninety miles east of Libertyville. The sky had gone a smooth and 
pregnant slate-grey by this time, and the temperature had dropped six degrees. 
It had been Arnie's idea that they not cancel the traditional Christmas Eve visit with Aunt 
Vicky and Uncle Steve, Regina's sister and her husband. The two families had created a 
casual, loosely rotating ritual over the years, with Vicky and Steve coming to their house 
some years, the Cunnhinghams going over to Ligonier on others. This year's trip had been 
arranged in early December. It had been cancelled after what Regina stubbornly called</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'Arnie's trouble', but at the beginning of last week, Arnie had begun restlessly agitating for 
the trip. 
At last, after a long telephone conversation with her sister on Wednesday, Regina gave in to 
Arnie's wish mostly because Vicky had seemed calm and understanding and most of all not 
very curious about what had happened. That was important to Regina - more important than 
she would perhaps ever be able to say. It seemed to her that in the eight days since Arnie had 
been arrested in New York, she had had to cope with a seemingly endless flood of rancid 
curiosity masquerading as sympathy. Talking to Vicky on the telephone, she had finally 
broken down and cried. It was the first and only time since Arnie had been arrested in New 
York that she had allowed herself that bitter luxury. Arnie had been in bed asleep. Michael, 
who was drinking much too much and passing it off as 'the spirit of the season', had gone 
down to O'Malley's for a beer or two with Paul Strickland, another factory reject in the game 
of faculty politics. It would probably end up being six beers, or eight, or ten. And if she went 
upstairs to his study later on, she would find him sitting bolt upright behind his desk, looking 
out into the dark, his eyes dry but bloodshot. if she tried to speak with him, his conversation 
would be horribly confused and centred too much in the past. She supposed her husband 
might be having a very quiet mental breakdown. She would not allow herself the same luxury 
(for so, in her own hurt and angry state, she thought it), and every night her mind ticked and 
whirred with plans and schemes until three or four o'clock, All these thoughts and schemes 
were aimed at one end: 'Getting us over this.' The only two ways she would allow her mind to 
approach what had happened were deliberately vague. She thought about 'Arnie's trouble' and 
'Getting us over this'. 
But, talking to Vicky on the phone a few days after her son's arrest, Regina's iron control 
had wavered briefly. She cried on Vicky's shoulder long-distance, and Vicky had been calmly 
comforting, making Regina hate herself for all the cheap shots she had taken at Vicky over 
the years. Vicky, whose only daughter had dropped out of junior college to get married and 
become a housewife, whose only son had been content with a vocational-technical school 
(none of that for her son! Regina had thought with a private exultation); Vicky whose 
husband sold, of all hilarious things, life insurance. And Vicky (hilariouser and hilariouser) 
sold Tupperware. But it was Vicky she had been able to cry to, it had been Vicky to whom 
she had been able to express at least part of her tortured sense of disappointment and terror 
and hurt; yes, and the terrible embarrassment of it, of knowing that people were talking and 
that people who had for years wanted to see her take a fall were now satisfied. It was Vicky, 
maybe it bad always been Vicky, and Regina decided that if there was to be a Christmas at all 
for them this miserable year, it would be at Vicky and Steve's ordinary suburban ranchhouse 
in the amusingly middle-class suburb of Ligonier, where most people still owned American 
cars and called a trip to McDonald's 'eating out'. 
Mike, of course, simply went along with her decision; she would have expected no more 
and brooked no less. 
For Regina Cunningham the three days following the news that Arnie was 'in trouble' had 
been are exercise in pure cold control, a hard lunge for survival. Her survival, the family's</p>
      <p class="calibre3">survival, Arnie's survival - he might not believe that, but Regina found she hadn't the time to 
care. Mike's pain had never entered her equations; the thought that they could comfort each 
other had never even crossed her mind as a speculation. She had calmly put the cover on her 
sewing machine after Mike came downstairs and gave her the news. She did that, and then 
she had gone to the phone and had gotten to work. The tears she would later shed while 
talking to her sister had then been a thousand years away. She had brushed past Michael as if 
he were a piece of furniture, and he had trailed uncertainly after her as he had done all of their 
married life. 
She called Tom Sprague, their lawyer, who, hearing that their problem was criminal, hastily 
referred her to a colleague, Jim Warberg. She called Warberg and got an answering service 
that would not reveal Warberg's home number. She sat by the phone for a moment, 
drumming her fingers lightly against her lips, and then called Sprague again. He hadn't 
wanted to give her Warberg's home telephone number, but in the end he gave in. When 
Regina finally let him go, Sprague sounded dazed, almost shell-shocked. Regina in full spate 
often caused such a reaction. 
She called Warberg, who said he absolutely couldn't take! the case. Regina had lowered her 
bulldozer blade again. Warberg ended up not only taking the case but agreeing to go 
immediately to Albany, where Arnie was being held, to see what could be done. Warberg, 
speaking in the weak, amazed voice of a man who has been filled full of Novocain and then 
run over by a tractor, protested that he knew a perfectly good man in Albany who could get 
the lay of the land. Regina was adamant. Warberg went by private plane and reported back 
four hours later. 
Arnie, he said, was being held on an open charge. He would be extradited to Pennsylvania 
the following day. Pennsylvania and New York had coordinated the bust along with three 
Federal agencies: the Federal Drug Control Task Force, the IRS, and the Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco, and Firearms. The main target was not Arnie, who was small beans, but Will 
Darnell - Darnell, and whomever Darnell was doing business with. Those guys, Warberg 
said, with their suspected ties to organized crime and disorganized drug smuggling in the new 
South, were the big beans. 
'Holding someone on an open charge is illegal,' Regina had snapped immediately, drawing 
on a deep backlog of TV crime-show fare. 
Warberg, not exactly overjoyed to be where he was when he had planned on spending a 
quiet evening at home reading a book, rejoined crisply, 'I'd be down on my knees thanking 
God that's what they're doing, They caught him with a trunkload of unstamped cigarettes, and 
if I push them on it, they'll be more than happy to charge him, Mrs Cunningham. I advise you 
and your husband to get over here to Albany. Quickly.' 
'I thought you said he was going to be extradited tomorrow - '</p>
      <p class="calibre3">. 'Oh, yes, that's all been arranged. If we've got to play hardball with these guys, we ought 
to be glad the game's going to be played on our home court. Extradition isn't the problem 
here.' 
'What is?' 
'These people want to play knock-over-the-dominoes. They want to knock your son over 
onto Will Darnell. Arnold is not talking. I want you two to get over here and persuade him 
that it's in his best interest to talk.' 
'Is it?' she had asked hesitantly. 
'Hell, yes!' Warberg's voice crackled back. 'These guys don't want to put your son in jail. 
He's a minor from a good family with no previous criminal record, not even a school record 
of disciplinary problems. He can get out of this without even facing a judge. But he's got to 
talk.' 
So they had gone to Albany, and Regina had been taken down a short, narrow hallway 
faced in white tile, lit with high-intensity bulbs sunken into small wells in the ceiling and 
covered with wire mesh. The place had smelled vaguely of Lysol and urine, and she kept 
trying to convince herself that her son was being held here, her son, but achieving that 
conviction was a hard go. It didn't seem possible that it could be true. The possibility that it 
was all a hallucination seemed much more likely. 
Seeing Arnie had stripped away that possibility in a hurry. The protective jacket of shock 
was likewise stripped away, and she felt a cold, consuming fear. It was at this moment that 
she had first seized on the idea of 'Getting us over this', the way a drowning person will seize 
a life preserver. It was Arnie, it was her son, not in a jail cell (that was the only thing she had 
been spared, but she was grateful for even small favours) but in a small square room whose 
only furnishings were two chairs and a table scarred with cigarette burns. 
Arnie had looked at her steadily, and his face seemed horribly gaunt, skull-like. He had 
been to the barber only a week before, and had gotten a surprisingly short haircut (after years 
of wearing it long, in emulation of Dennis), and now the overhead light shone down cruelly 
through what was left, making him appear momentarily bald, as if they had shaved his head 
to loosen his lips. 
'Arnie,' she said, and went to him - halfway to him. He turned his head away from her, his 
lips pressing together, and she stopped. A lesser woman might have burst into tears then, but 
Regina was not a lesser woman. She let the coldness come back and have its way with her. 
The coldness was all that would help now, 
Instead of embracing him - something he obviously didn't want - she sat down and told him 
what had to be done. He refused. She ordered him to talk to the police. He refused again. She 
reasoned with him. He refused. She harangued him. He refused. She pleaded with him. He 
refused. Finally she just sat there dully, a headache thudding at her temples, and asked him 
why. He refused to tell her.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'I thought you were smart!' she shouted finally. She was nearly mad with frustration - the 
thing she hated above all others was not getting her way when she absolutely wanted to have 
it, needed to have it; this had in fact ever happened to her since she left home. Until now. It 
was infuriating to be so smoothly and seamlessly baulked by this boy who had once drawn 
milk from her breasts. 'I thought you were smart but you're stupid! You're . . . you're an 
asshole! They'll put you in jail! Do you want to go to jail for that man Darnell? Is that what 
you want? He'll laugh at you! He'll laugh at you!' Regina could imagine nothing worse, and 
her son's apparent lack of interest in whether or not he was laughed at infuriated her all the 
more. 
She rose from her chair and pushed her hair away from her brow and eyes, the unconscious 
gesture of a person who is ready to fight. She was breathing rapidly, and her face was 
flushed. To Arnie, she looked both younger and much, much older than he had ever seen her. 
'I'm not doing it for Darnell,' he said quietly, 'and I'm not going to jail.' 
'What are you, Oliver Wendell Holmes?' she rejoined fiercely, but her anger was in some 
measure overmastered by relief. At least he could say something. 'They caught you in his car 
with the boot loaded with cigarettes! Illegal cigarettes!' 
Mildly, Arnie said, 'They weren't in the boot. They were in a compartment under the boot. 
A secret compartment. And it was Will's car. Will told me to take his car.' She looked at him. 
'Are you saying you didn't know they were there?' 
Arnie looked at her with an expression she simply couldn't accept, it was so foreign to his 
face - it was contempt. Good as gold, my boy's as good as gold, she thought crazily. 
'I knew, and Will knew. But they have to prove it, don't they?' 
She could only look at him, amazed. 
'If they do drop it on me somehow,' he said, 'I'll get a suspended sentence.' 
'Arnie,' she said at last, 'you're not thinking straight. Maybe your father - ' 
'Yes,' he interrupted. 'I'm thinking straight. I don't know what you're doing, but I'm thinking 
very straight.' 
And he looked at her, his grey eyes so horribly blank that she could no longer stand it and 
had to leave. 
In the small green reception room she walked blindly past her husband, who had been 
sitting on a bench with Warberg. 'You go in,' she said. 'You make him see reason.' She went 
on without waiting for his reply, not stopping until she was outside and the cold December air 
was painting her hot cheeks. 
Michael went in and had no better luck; he came out with nothing more than a dry throat 
and a face that looked ten years older than it had going in.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">At the motel, Regina told Warberg what Arnie had said and asked him if there was any 
chance he might be right. 
Warberg looked thoughtful. 'Yes, that's a possible defence,' he said. 'But it would be a 
helluva lot more possible if Arnie was the first domino in line. He's not. There's a used-car 
dealer here in Albany named Henry Buck. He was the catcher. He's been arrested too.' 
'What has he said?' Michael asked. 
'I have no way of knowing. But when I tried to I speak to his lawyer, he declined to speak 
with me. I find that ominous. If Buck talks, he puts the onus on Arnie. I'll bet you my house 
and lot that Buck can testify your son knew that secret compartment was there, and that's 
bad.' Warberg looked at them closely. 
'You see, what your boy said to you is really only half-smart, Mrs Cunningham. I'll be 
talking to him tomorrow, before they move him back to Pennsylvania. What I hope to make 
him see is that there's a possibility this whole thing could come down on his head.' 
* * * * * 
The first flakes of snow began to swirl out of the heavy sky as they turned onto Steve and 
Vicky's street. Is it snowing in Libertyville yet? Arnie wondered, and touched the keys on 
their leather tab in his pocket. Probably it was. 
Christine was still in Darnell's Garage, impounded. That was all right. At least she was out 
of the weather. He would pick her up again. In time. 
The previous weekend was like a blurred bad dream. His parents, haranguing him in the 
little white room, had seemed to bear the disconnected faces of strangers; they were heads 
talking in a foreign language. The lawyer they had hired, Warley or Warmly or whatever, 
kept talking about something he called the domino theory, and about the need to get out of 
'the condemned building before the whole thing falls down on your' head, boy - there are two 
states and three Federal agencies bringing up the wrecking balls.' 
But Arnie was more worried about Christine. 
It seemed clearer and clearer to him that Roland D. LeBay was either with him or hovering 
someplace near he was, perhaps, coalescing inside him. This idea did not frighten Arnie; it 
comforted him. But he had to be careful. Not of Junkins; he felt that Junkins had only 
suspicions, and that they all lay in wrong directions, radiating out from Christine rather than 
in toward her. 
But Darnell . . . there could be problems with Will. Yes, real problems. 
That first night in Albany, after his mother and father had gone back to their motel, Arnie 
had been conducted to a holdin cell, where he had fallen asleep with surprising ease and 
speed. And he had had a dream - not quite a nightmare, but something that seemed terribly</p>
      <p class="calibre3">disquieting. He had awakened watchfully in the middle of the night, his body running with 
sweat. 
He had dreamed that Christine had been reduced in scale to a tiny '58 Plymouth no longer 
than a man's hand. It was on a slotcar track surrounded by HO-scale scenery that was 
amazingly apt - here was a plastic street that could be Basin Drive, here was another that 
could be JFK Drive, where Moochie Welch had been killed. A Lego building that looked 
exactly like Libertyville High. Plastic houses, paper trees . . . 
. . . and a gigantic, hulking Will Darnell was at the controls that dictated how fast or how 
slowly the tiny Fury ran through all of this. His breath wheezed in and out of his damaged 
lungs with a windstorm sound. 
You don't want to open your mouth, kiddo, Will said ' He loomed over this scale-model 
world like the Amazing Colossal Man. You don't want to frig with me because I'm in control; 
I can do this - 
And slowly, Will began to turn the control knob over toward FAST. 
No! Arnie tried to scream. No, don't do that, please! I love her! Please, you'll kill her! 
On the track, the tiny Christine raced through the tiny Libertyville faster and faster, her rear 
end switching on the curves as she shimmied on the far edge of centrifugal force, that dish-
shaped mystery, Now she was simply a blur of white-over-red, her engine a high, angry 
wasp-whine. 
Please! Arnie screamed. Pleeeeeaaaaase! 
At last, Will had begun to turn the control back, looking grimly pleased. The little car began 
to slow down. 
If you start to get ideas, you just want to remember where your car is, kiddo. Keep your 
mouth shut and we'll both live to fight another day. I've been in tighter jams than this - 
Arnie had reached out to grasp the little car, to rescue it from the track. The dream - Will 
had slapped his hand away. 
Whose bag is it, kiddo? 
Will, please - 
Let me hear you say it. 
It's my bag. 
Just remember it, kiddo. 
And Arnie had awakened with that in his ears. There, had been no more sleep for him that 
night.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Was it so unlikely that Will would know . . . well, would know something about Christine? 
No. He saw a great deal from behind that window, but he knew how to keep his mouth shut - 
at least until the time was right to open it. He might know what Junkins did not, that 
Christine's regeneration in November was not just strange but totally impossible. He would 
know that a lot of the repairs had never been made, at least not by Arnie. 
What else would he know? 
With a creeping coldness that moved up his legs to the root of his guts, Arnie realized at 
last that. Will could have been at the garage the night Repperton and the others had died. In 
fact, it was more than possible. It was probable. Jimmy Sykes was simple, and Will didn't 
like to trust him alone. 
You don't want to open your mouth. You don't want to frig with me because I can do this. . .. 
But even supposing Will knew, who would believe him? It was too late for self-delusion 
now, and Arnie could no longer put the unthinkable thought away from himself . . . he no 
longer even wanted to. Who would believe Will if Will decided to tell someone that Christine 
sometimes ran by herself? That she had been out on her own the night Moochie Welch was 
killed, and the night those other hoods were killed? Would the police believe that? They 
would laugh themselves into a haemorrhage. Junkins? Getting warmer, but Arnie didn't 
believe Junkins would be able to accept such a thing, even if he wanted to. Arnie had seen his 
eyes. So even if Will did know, what good would his knowledge do? 
Then, with mounting horror, Arnie realized that it didn't matter. Will would be out on bail 
tomorrow or the next day, and then Christine would be his ' hostage. He could torch it - he 
had torched plenty of cars in his time, as Arnie knew from sitting in the office and listening to 
him yarn - and after she was torched, a burned hulk, helpless, there was the crusher out back. 
In goes the- cindered hulk of Christine on the conveyor belt, out comes a smashed cube of 
metal. 
The cops have sealed the place. 
But that didn't cut any ice, either. Will Darnell was a very old fox, and he stayed prepared 
for any contingency. If Will wanted to get in and torch Christine, he would do it . . . although 
it was much more likely, Arnie thought, that he would hire an insurance specialist to do the 
job - a guy who would throw double handfuls of charcoal-lighter cubes into the car and then 
toss a match. 
In his mind's eye Arnie could see the blossoming flames. He could smell charring 
upholstery. 
He lay on the cell bunk, his mouth dry, his heart beating rapidly in his chest. 
You don't want to open your mouth. You don't want to frig with me. . . . 
Of course, if Will tried something and got careless - if his concentration lapsed for even a 
moment - Christine would get him. But somehow Arnie didn't think Will would get careless.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">* * * * * 
The next day he had been taken back to Pennsylvania, charged, then bailed for a nominal 
sum. There would be a preliminary hearing in January, and there was already talk of a grand 
jury. The bust was front-page material across the state, although Arnie was only identified as 
'a youth' whose name was 'being withheld by state and Federal authorities due to his minor 
status.' 
Arnie's name was common enough knowledge in Libertyville, however. In spite of its new 
exurban sprawl of drive-ins, fast-food emporiums, and Bowl-a-Ramas, it was still a faculty 
town where a lot of people were living in other people's back pockets. These people, mostly 
associated with Horlicks University, knew who had been driving for Will Darnell and who 
had been arrested over the New York State line with a bootful of contraband cigarettes. It was 
Regina's nightmare. 
Arnie went home in the custody of his parents - bailed for a thousand dollars - after a brief 
detour to jail. It was all nothing but a big shitting game of Monopoly, really. His parents had 
come up with the Get Out of Jail Free card. As expected. 
* * * * * 
'What are you smiling' about, Arnie?' Regina asked him. Michael was driving the wagon 
along at fast walking speed, looking through the swirls of snow for Steve and Vicky's 
ranchhouse. 
'Was I smiling?' 
'Yes,' she said, and touched her hair. 
'I don't really remember,' he said remotely, and she took her hand away. 
* * * * * 
They had come home on Sunday and his parents had left him pretty much alone, either 
because they didn't know how to talk to him or because they were utterly disgusted with him . 
. . or perhaps it was a combination of the two. He didn't give a crap which, and that was the 
truth. He felt washed out, exhausted, a ghost of himself. His mother had gone to bed and slept 
all that afternoon, after taking the telephone off the hook. His father puttered aimlessly in his 
workroom, running his electric planer periodically and then shutting it off. 
Arnie sat in the living room watching a football playoff doubleheader, not knowing who 
was playing, not caring, content to watch the players run around, first in bright warm 
California sunshine, later in a mixture of rain and sleet that turned the playing field to 
churned-up mud and erased the lines. 
Around six o'clock he dozed off. 
And dreamed.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">He dreamed again that night and the next, in the bed where he had slept since earliest 
childhood, the elm outside casting its old familiar shadow (a skeleton each winter that gained 
miraculous new flesh each May). These dreams were not like the dream of the giant Will 
looming over the slotcar track. He could not remember these dreams at all more than a few 
moments after waking. Perhaps that was just as well. A figure by the roadside; a fleshless 
finger tapping a decayed palm in a lunatic parody of instruction; an uneasy sense of freedom 
and . . . escape? Yes, escape. Nothing else except . . . 
Yes, he escaped from these dreams and back into reality with one repeating image: he was 
behind the wheel of Christine, driving slowly through a howling blizzard, snow so thick that 
he could literally see no farther than the end of her hood. The wind was not a scream; it was a 
lower, more sinister sound a basso roar. Then the image had changed. The snow wasn't snow 
any longer; it was tickertape. The roar of the wind was the roar of a great crowd lining both 
sides of Fifth Avenue. They were cheering him. They were cheering Christine. They were 
cheering because he and Christine had . . . had . . . 
Escaped. 
Each time this confused dream retreated, he thought, When this is over I'm getting out . 
Getting out for sure. Going to drive to Mexico. And Mexico, as he imagined its steady sun 
and its rural quiet, seemed more real than the dreams. 
Shortly after awakening from the last of these dreams, the idea of spending Christmas with 
Aunt Vicky and Uncle Steve, just like in the old days, had come to him. He awoke with it, 
and it clanged in his head with a peculiar persistence. The idea seemed to be an awfully good 
one, an all-important one. To get out of Libertyville before . . . 
Well, before Christmas. What else? 
So he began talking to his mother and father about it, coming down particularly hard on 
Regina. On Wednesday, she abruptly gave in and agreed. He knew she had talked to Vicky, 
and Vicky hadn't been inclined to lord it over her, so it was all right. 
Now, on Christmas Eve, he felt that everything would soon be all right. 
* * * * * 
'There it is, Mike,' Regina said, 'and you're going to drive right by it, just like you do every 
time we come here.' 
Michael grunted and turned into the driveway. 'I saw it,' he said in the perpetually defensive 
tone he always seemed to use around his wife. He's a donkey, Arnie thought. She talks to him 
like a donkey, she rides him like a donkey, and he brays like a donkey. 
'You're smiling again,' Regina said. 
'I was just thinking about how much I love you both,' Arnie said. His father looked at him, 
surprised and touched; there was a soft gleam in his mother's eyes that might have been tears.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">They really believed it. 
The shitters. 
* * * * * 
By three o'clock that Christmas Eve the snow was still only isolated flurries, although the 
flurries were beginning to blend into each other. The delay in the storm's arrival was not good 
news, the weather forecasters said. It had compacted itself and turned even more vicious. 
Predictions of possible accumulations had gone from a foot to a possible eighteen inches, 
with serious drifting in high winds. 
Leigh Cabot sat in the living room of her house, across from a small natural Christmas tree 
that was already beginning to shed its needles (in her house she was the voice of 
traditionalism and for four years had successfully staved off her father's wish for a synthetic 
tree and her mother's wish to kick off the holiday season with a goose or a capon. instead of 
the traditional Thanksgiving turkey). She was alone in the house. Her mother and father had 
gone over to the Stewarts for Christmas Eve drinks; Mr Stewart was her father's new boss, 
and they liked each other. This was a friendship Mrs Cabot was eager to promote. In the last 
ten years they had moved six times, hopping all over the eastern seaboard, and of all the 
places they had been, her mom liked Libertyville the best. She wanted to stay here, and her 
husband's friendship with Mr Stewart could go a long way toward ensuring that. 
All alone and still a virgin, she thought. That was an utterly stupid thing to think, but all the 
same she got up suddenly, as if stung. She went into the kitchen, over-conscious of that 
Formica wonderland's little servo-sounds: electric clock, the oven where a ham was baking 
(turn that off at five if they're not back, she reminded herself), a cool clunk from the freezer as 
the Frigidaire's icemaker made another cube. 
She opened the fridge, saw a six-pack of Coke sitting in there next to Daddy's beer, and 
thought: Get thee behind me, Satan. Then she grabbed a can anyway. Never mind what it did 
to her complexion. She wasn't going with anyone now. If she broke out, so what? 
The empty house made her uneasy. It never had before; she had always felt pleased and 
absurdly competent when they left her alone - a holdover from childhood days, no doubt. The 
house had always seemed comforting to her. But now the sounds of the kitchen, of the rising 
wind outside, even the scuff of her slippers on the linoleum those sounds seemed sinister, 
even frightening. If things had worked out differently, Arnie could have been here with her. 
Her folks, especially her mother, had liked him. At first. Now, of course, after what had 
happened, her mother would probably wash her mouth out with soap if she knew Leigh was 
even thinking of him. But she did think of him. Too much of the time. Wondering why he 
had changed. Wondering how he was taking the breakup. Wondering if he was okay. 
The wind rose to a shriek and then fell off a little, reminding her - for no reason, of course - 
of a car's engine reving and then failing off.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Won't come back from Dead Man's' Curve, her mind whispered strangely, and for no reason 
at all (of course) she went to the sink and poured her Coke down the drain and wondered if 
she was going to cry, or throw up, or what. 
She realized with dawning surprise that she was in a state of low terror. 
For no reason at all. 
Of course. 
At least her parents had left the car in the garage (cars, she had cars on the brain). She didn't 
like to think of her dad trying to drive home from the Stewarts' in this, half-soused from three 
or four martinis (except that he always called them martoonis, with typical adult 
kittenishness). It was only three blocks, and the two of them had left the house bundled up 
and giggling, looking like a couple of large children on their way to make a snowman. The 
walk home would sober them up. It would be good for them. It would be good for them if . . . 
The wind rose again - gunning around the eaves and then falling off - and she suddenly saw 
her mother an father walking up the street through clouds of blowing snow, holding onto each 
other to keep from falling on their drunken, lovable asses, laughing. Daddy maybe goosing 
Mom through her snowpants. The way he sometimes goosed her when he got a buzz on was 
also something that had always irritated Leigh precisely because it seemed such a juvenile 
thing for a grown man to do. But of course she loved them both. Her love was a part of the 
irritation, and her occasional exasperation with them was very much a part of her love. 
They were walking together through a snow as thick as heavy smoke and then two huge 
green eyes opened in the white behind them, seeming to float . . . eyes that looked terribly 
like the circles of the dashboard instruments she had seen as she was choking to death . . . and 
they were growing . . . stalking her helpless, laughing, squiffy parents. 
She drew a harsh breath and went back into the living room. She approached the telephone, 
almost touched it, then veered away and went back to the window, looking out into the white 
and cupping her elbows in the palms of her hands. 
What had she been about to do? Call them? Tell them she was alone in the house and had 
gotten thinking about Arnie's old and somehow slinking car, his steel girlfriend Christine, and 
that she wanted them to come home because she was scared for them and herself? Was that 
what she was going to do? 
Cute, Leigh. Cute. 
The ploughed blacktop of the street was disappearing under new snow, but slowly; it had 
only just begun to snow really hard, and the wind periodically tried to clear the street with 
strong gusts that sent membranes of powder twisting and rising to merge with the whitish-
grey sky of the stormy afternoon like slowly twisting smoke-ghosts. . . . 
Oh, but the terror was there, it was real, and something was going to happen. She knew it. 
She had been shocked to hear that Arnie had been arrested for smuggling, but that reaction</p>
      <p class="calibre3">had been nowhere as strong as the sick fear she had felt when she opened the paper on an 
earlier day and saw what had happened to Buddy Repperton and those other two boys, that 
day when her first crazy, terrible, and somehow certain thought had been. Christine. 
And now the premonition of some new piece of black work hung heavily on her, and she 
couldn't get rid of it, it was crazy, Arnie had been in Philadelphia at a chess tourney, she had 
asked around that day, that was all there was to it and she would not think about this anymore 
she would turn on all the radios the TV fill the house up with sound not think about that car 
that smelled like the grave that car that had tried to kill her murder her. 
'Oh damn,' she whispered. 'Can't you quit?'  
Her arms, sculpted rigidly in gooseflesh. 
Abruptly she went to the telephone again, found the phone book, and as Arnie had done on 
an evening some two weeks before, she called Libertyville Community Hospital. A pleasant-
voiced receptionist told her that Mr Guilder had been checked out that morning. Leigh 
thanked her and hung up. 
She stood thoughtful in the empty living room, looking at the small tree, the presents, the 
manger in the corner. Then she looked up the Guilders' number in the phone book and dialled 
it. 
'Leigh,' Dennis said, happily pleased. 
The phone in her hand felt cold. 'Dennis, can I come over and talk to you?' 
'Today?' he asked, surprised. 
Confused thoughts tumbled through her mind. The ham in the oven. She had to turn the 
oven off at five. Her parents would be home. It was Christmas Eve. The snow. And . . . and 
she didn't think it would be safe to be out tonight. Out walking on the sidewalks, when 
anything might come looming out of the snow. Anything at all. Not tonight, that was the 
worst. She didn't think it would be safe to be out tonight. 
'Leigh?' 
'Not tonight,' she said. 'I'm house-sitting for my folks. 
They're at a cocktail party.' 
'Yeah, mine too,' Dennis said, amused. 'My sister and I are playing Parcheesi. She cheats.' 
Faintly: 'I do not!' 
At another time it might have been funny. It wasn't now. 
After Christmas. Maybe on Tuesday. The twenty-sixth. Would that be all right?' 
'Sure,' he said. 'Leigh, is it about Arnie?'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'No,' she said, clutching the telephone so tightly that her hand felt numb. She had to 
struggle with her voice. 'No - not Arnie. I want to talk to you about Christine.'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">42   THE STORM BREAKS

Yeah, late at night when I'm dead on the line,                                                                                              
I swear I think of your pretty face when I let her wind.                                                              
Well look over yonder, see those city lights?                                                                                   
Come on, little darlin, go ramroddin tonight.

By five o'clock that evening the storm had blanketed Pennsylvania; it screamed across the 
state from border to border its howling throat full of snow. There was no final Christmas Eve 
rush, and most of the weary and shell-shocked clerks and salespeople were grateful to mother 
nature in spite of the missed overtime. There would, they told each other over Christmas Eve 
drinks in front of freshly kindled fires, be plenty of that when returns started on Tuesday. 
Mother nature didn't seem all that motherly that evening as early dusk gave way to full dark 
and then to blizzardy night. She was a pagan, fearsome old witch that night, a harridan on the 
wind, and Christmas meant nothing to her; she ripped down Chamber of Commerce tinsel 
and sent it gusting high into the black sky, she blew the large nativity scene in front of the 
police station into a snowbank where the sheep, the goats, the Holy Mother and Child were 
not found until a late January thaw uncovered them. And as a final spit in the eye of the 
holiday season, she tipped over the forty-foot tree that had stood in front of the Libertyville 
Municipal Building And sent it through a big window and into the town Tax Assessor's 
office. A good place for it, many said later. 
By seven o'clock the ploughs had begun to fall behind. A Trailways bus bulled its way up 
Main Street at quarter past seven, a short line of cars dogging its silvery rump like puppies 
behind their mother, and then the street was empty except for a few slant-parked cars that had 
already been buried to the bumpers by the passing ploughs. By morning, most of them would 
be buried entirely. At the intersection of Main Street and Basin Drive, a stop-and-go light that 
directed no one at all twisted and danced from its power cable in the wind. There was a 
sudden electrical fizzing noise and the light went dark. Two or three passengers from the last 
city bus of the day were crossing the street at the time; they glanced up and then hurried on. 
By eight o'clock, when Mr and Mrs Cabot finally arrived home (to Leigh's great but 
unspoken relief), the local radio stations were broadcasting a plea from the Pennsylvania 
State Police for everyone to stay off the roads. 
By nine o'clock, as Michael, Regina, and Arnie Cunningham, equipped with hot rum 
punches (Uncle Steve's avowed Speciality of the Season), were gathering around the 
television with Uncle Steve and Aunt Vicky to watch Alastair Sim in A Christmas Carol, a</p>
      <p class="calibre3">forty-mile stretch of the Pennsylvania Turnpike had been closed by drifting snow. By 
midnight almost all of it would be closed. 
By nine-thirty, when Christine's headlights suddenly came on in Will Darnell's deserted 
garage, cutting a bright arc through the interior blackness, Libertyville had totally shut down, 
except for the occasional cruising ploughs. 
In the silent garage, Christine's engine gunned and fell off. 
Gunned and fell off. 
In the empty front seat, the gearstick lever dropped down into DRIVE. 
Christine began to move. 
The electric eye gadget clipped to the driver' s sun-visor hummed briefly. Its low sound was 
lost in the howl of the wind. But the door heard; it rattled upward obediently on its tracks. 
Snow blew in and swirled gustily. 
Christine passed outside, wraithlike in the snow. She turned right and moved down the 
street, her tyres cutting through the deep snow cleanly and firmly, with no spin, skid, or 
hesitation. 
A turnblinker came on - one amber, winking eye in the snow. She turned left, toward JFK 
Drive. 
* * * * * 
Don Vandenberg sat behind the desk inside the office of his father's gas station. Both his 
feet and his pecker were up. He was reading one of his father's fuckbooks, a deeply incisive 
and thought-provoking tome titled Swap-Around Pammie. Pammie had gotten it from just 
about everyone but the milkman and the dog, and the milkman was coming up the drive and 
the dog was lying at her feet when the bell dinged, signalling a customer. 
Don looked up impatiently. He had called his father at six, four hours ago, and asked him if 
he shouldn't close the station down - there wouldn't be enough business tonight to pay for the 
electricity it took to light up the sign. His father, sitting home warm and toasty and safely 
shitfaced, had told him to keep it open until midnight. If there ever was a Scrooge, Don had 
thought resentfully as he slammed the phone back down, his old man was it. 
The simple fact was, he didn't like being alone at night anymore. Once, and not so long ago 
at that, he would have had plenty of company. Buddy would have been here, and Buddy was 
a magnet, drawing the others with his booze, his occasional gram of coke, but most of all 
with the simple force of his personality. But now they were gone. All gone. 
Except sometimes it seemed to Don that they weren't. Sometimes it seemed to him (when 
he was alone, as he was tonight) that he might look up and see them sitting there - Richie 
Trelawney on one side, Moochie Welch on the other, and Buddy between them with a bottle</p>
      <p class="calibre3">of Texas Driver in his hand and a joint cocked behind his ear. Horribly white, all three of 
them, like vampires, their eyes as glazed as the eyes of dead fish. And Buddy would hold out 
the bottle and whisper, Catch yourself a drink, asshole - pretty soon you'll be dead, like us. 
These fantasies were sometimes real enough to leave him with his mouth dry and his hands 
shaking. 
And the reason why wasn't lost on Don. They never should have trashed old Cuntface's car 
that night. Every single one of the guys in on that little prank had died horrible deaths. All of 
them, that was, except for him and Sandy Galton, and Sandy had gotten in that old, broken-
down Mustang of his and taken off somewhere. On these long night shifts, Don often thought 
he would like to do the same. 
Outside, the customer beeped his horn. 
Don slammed the book down on the desk next to the greasy credit-card machine and 
struggled into his parka, peering out at the car and wondering who would be crazy enough to 
be out in a shitstorm like this one. In the blowing snow, it was impossible to tell anything 
about either the car or the customer; he could make out nothing for sure but the headlights 
and the shape of the body, which was too long for a new ear. 
Someday, he thought, drawing on his gloves and bidding a reluctant farewell to his hard-on, 
his father would put in self-service pumps and all this shit would end. If people were crazy 
enough to be out on a night like this, they should have to pump their own gas. 
The door almost ripped itself out of his hand. He held onto it so it wouldn't slam back into 
the cinderblock side of the building and maybe shatter the glass; he almost went down on his 
ass for his pains. In spite of the steady hooting of the wind (which he had been trying not to 
hear), he had totally misjudged the force of the storm. The very depth of the snow - better 
than eight inches - helped to keep him on his feet. That fucking car must be on snowshoes, he 
thought resentfully. Guy gives me a credit-card I'm gonna fuse his spine. 
He waded through the snow, approaching the first set of islands. The fuckstick had parked 
at the far set. Naturally. Don tried to glance up once, but the wind threw snow into his face in 
a stinging sheet and he lowered his head quickly, letting the top of the parka's hood take the 
brunt of it. 
He crossed in front of the car, bathed for a moment in the bright but heatless glow of its 
dual headlights. He struggled and floundered around to the driver's side. The pump island's 
fluorescents made the car into a garish white-over-purple burgundy shade. His cheeks were 
already numb. If this guy wants a dollar's worth and asks me to check the oil, I'm telling him 
to cram it, he thought, and raised his head into the sting of the snow as the window went 
down. _ 
'Can I h - ' he began, and the h-sound of help you became a high, hissing, strengthless 
scream: hhhhhhhhhaaaaaaahhhh -</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Leaning out of the window, less than six inches from his own face, was a rotting corpse. Its 
eyes were wide, empty sockets, its mummified lips were drawn back from a few yellowed, 
leaning teeth. One hand lay whitely on the steering wheel. The other, clicking horridly, 
reached out to touch him. 
Don floundered backward, his heart a runaway engine in his chest, his terror a monstrous 
hot rock in his throat. The dead thing beckoned him, grinning, and the car's engine suddenly 
screamed, piling up revs. 
'Fill it up,' the corpse whispered, and in spite of his shock and horror, Don saw it was 
wearing the tattered and moss-slimed remains of an Army uniform. 'Fill it up, you shitter.' 
Skull-teeth grinned in the fluorescent light. Far back in that mouth a bit of gold twinkled. 
'Catch yourself a drink, asshole,' another voice whispered hoarsely, and Buddy Repperton 
leaned forward in the back seat, extending a bottle of Texas Driver toward Don. Worms 
spilled and squirmed through his grin. Beetles crawled in what remained of his hair. 'I think 
you must need one.' 
Don shrieked, the sound bulletins up and out of him. He whirled away, running through the 
snow in great leaping cartoon steps; he shrieked again as the car's engine screamed V-8 
power; he looked back over his shoulder and saw that it was Christine standing by the pumps, 
Arnie's Christine, now moving, churning snow up behind her rear tyres, and the things he had 
seen were gone - that was even worse, somehow. The things were gone. The car was moving 
on its own. 
He had turned toward the street, and now he climbed up over the snowbank thrown up by 
the passing ploughs and down the other side. Here the wind had swept the pavement clear of 
everything except an occasional blister of ice. Don skidded on one of these. His feet went out 
from under him. He landed on his back with a thump. 
A moment later the street was flooded with white light. Don rolled over and looked up, 
eyes straining wildly in their sockets, in time to see the huge white circles of Christine's 
headlights as she slammed through the snowbank and bore down on him like a locomotive. 
* * * * * 
Like Gaul, all of Libertyville Heights was divided into three parts. The semicircle closest to 
town on the low shoal of hills that had been known as Liberty Lookout until the mid-
nineteenth century (a Bicentennial Plaque on the corner of Rogers and Tacklin streets so 
reminded) was the town's only real poor section. It was an unhappy warren of apartments and 
wooden-frame buildings. Rope clotheslines spanned scruffy back yards which were, in more 
temperate seasons, littered with kids and Fisher-Price toys - in too many cases, both kids and 
toys had been badly battered. This neighbourhood, once middle-class, had been growing 
tackier ever since the war jobs had dried up in 1945. The decline moved slowly at first, then 
began to gain speed in the '60s and early '70s. Now the worst yet had come, although nobody 
would come right out and say it, at least not in public, where he or she could be quoted. Now 
the blacks were moving in. It was said in private, in the better parts of town, over barbecues</p>
      <p class="calibre3">and drinks: the blacks, God help us, the blacks are discovering Libertyville. The area had 
even gained its own name - not Liberty Lookout but the Low Heights. It was a name many 
found chillingly ghetto-ish. The editor of the Keystone had been quietly informed by several 
of his biggest advertisers that to use that phrase in print, thus legitimizing it, would make 
them very unhappy. The editor, whose mother had raised no fools, never did so. 
Heights Avenue split off from Basin Drive in Libertyville proper and then began to rise. It 
cut cleanly through the middle of the Low Heights and then left them behind. The road then 
climbed through a greenbelt and into a residential area. This section of town was known 
simply as the Heights. All this might seem confusing to you - Heights this and Heights-that - 
but Libertyville residents knew what they were talking about. When you said the Low 
Heights, you meant poverty, genteel or otherwise. When you left off the adjective 'Low', you 
meant poverty's direct opposite. Here were fine old homes, most of them set tastefully back 
from the road, some of the finest behind thick yew hedges. Libertyville's movers and shakers 
lived here - the newspaper publisher, four doctors, the rich and dotty granddaughter of the 
man who had invented the rapid-fire ejection system for automatic pistols. Most of the rest 
were lawyers. 
Beyond this area of respectable small-town wealth, Heights Avenue passed through a 
wooded area that was really too thick to be called a greenbelt; the woods lined both sides of 
the road for more than three miles. At the highest point of the Heights, Stanson Road 
branched off to the left, dead-ending at the Embankment, overlooking the town and the 
Libertyville Drive-In. 
On the other side of this low mountain (but also known as the Heights), was a fairly old 
middle-class neighbourhood where houses forty and fifty years old were slowly mellowing. 
As this area began to thin out into countryside, Heights Avenue became County Road No. 2. 
At ten-thirty on that Christmas Eve, a 1958 two-tone Plymouth moved up Heights Avenue, 
its lights cutting through the snow-choked, raving dark. Long-time natives of the Heights 
would have said that nothing - except maybe a four-wheel-drive - could have gotten up 
Heights Avenue that night, but Christine moved along at a steady thirty miles an hour, 
headlights probing, wipers moving rhythmically back and forth, totally empty within. Its 
fresh tracks where alone, and in places they were almost a foot deep. The steady wind filled 
them in quickly. Now and again her front bumper and hood would explode through the ridged 
back of a snowdrift, nosing the powder aside easily. 
Christine passed the Stanson Road turnoff and the Embankment, where Arnie and Leigh 
had once trysted. She reached the top of Liberty Heights and headed down the far side, at first 
through black woods cut only by the white ribbon that marked the road, then past the 
suburban houses with their cosy living-room lights and, in some cases, their cheery trim of 
Christmas lights. In one of these houses, a young man who had just finished playing Santa 
and who was having a drink with his wife to celebrate, happened to glance out and see 
headlights passing by. He pointed it out to her.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'If that guy came over the Heights tonight,' this young man said with a grin, 'he must have 
had the devil riding shotgun.' 
'Never mind that,' she said. 'Now that the kids are taken care of, what do I get from Santa? 
He grinned. 'We'll think of something.' 
* * * * * 
Farther down the road, almost at the point where the Heights ceased being the Heights, Will 
Darnell sat in the living room of the simple two-storey frame house he had owned for thirty 
years. He was wearing a bald and fading blue terrycloth robe over his pyjama bottoms, his 
huge sack of stomach pushing out like a swollen moon. He was watching the final conversion 
of Ebenezer Scrooge to the side of Goodness and Generosity, but not really seeing it. His 
mind was once more sifting through the pieces of a puzzle that grew steadily more 
fascinating: Arnie, Welch, Repperton, Christine. Will had aged a decade in the week or so 
since the bust. He had told that cop Mercer that he would be back doing business at the same 
old stand in two weeks, but in his heart he wondered. It seemed that lately his throat was 
always slimy from the taste of that goddam aspirator. 
Arnie, Welch Repperton . . . Christine 
 'Boy!' Scrooge hailed down from his window, a caricature of the Christmas Spirit in his 
nightgown and cap. 'Is the prize turkey still in the butcher's window?' 
'Wot?' the boy asked. 'The one as big as I am?' 
'Yes, yes,' Scrooge answered, giggling wildly. It was as if the three spirits had, instead of 
saving him, driven him mad. 'The one as big as you are!' 
Arnie, Welch, Repperton . . . LeBay? 
Sometimes he thought it was not the bust that had tired him out and made him feel so 
constantly beaten and afraid. That it was not even the fact that they had busted his pet 
accountant or that the Federal tax people were in on it and were obviously loaded for bear 
this time. The tax people weren't the reason that he had begun scanning the street before 
going out mornings; the State Attorney General's Office didn't have anything to do with the 
sudden glances he had begun throwing back over his shoulder when he was driving home 
nights from the garage. 
He had gone over what he had seen that night - or what he thought he had seen - again and 
again, trying to convince himself that it was absolutely not real . . . or that it absolutely was. 
For the first time in years he found himself doubting his own senses. And as the event 
receded into the past, it became easier to believe he had fallen asleep and dreamed the whole 
thing. 
He hadn't seen Arnie since the bust, or tried to call him on the telephone. At first he had 
thought to use his knowledge about Christine as a lever to keep Arnie's mouth shut if the kid</p>
      <p class="calibre3">weakened and took a notion to talk - God knew the kid could go a long way toward sending 
him to jail if he cooperated with the cops. It wasn't until after the police had landed 
everywhere that Will realized how much the kid knew, and he had had a few panicky 
moments of self-appraisal (something else that was upsetting because it was so foreign to his 
nature): had all of them known that much? Repperton, and all the hoody Repperton clones 
stretching back over the years? Could he actually have been so stupid? 
No, he decided. It was only Cunningham. Because Cunningham was different. He seemed 
to understand things almost intuitively. He wasn't all brag and booze and bullshit. In a queer 
way, Will felt almost fatherly toward the boy - not that he would have hesitated to cut the kid 
loose if it started to look as if he was going to rock the boat. And not that I'd hesitate now, he 
assured himself. 
On the TV, a scratchy black-and-white Scrooge was with the Cratchets. The film was 
almost over. The whole bunch of them looked like loonies, and that was the truth, but 
Scrooge was definitely the worst. The look of mad joy in his eye was not so different from 
the last look in the eye of a man Will had known twenty years before, a fellow named Everett 
Dingle who had gone home from the garage one afternoon and murdered his entire family. 
Will lit a cigar. Anything to take the taste of the aspirator out of his mouth, that rotten taste. 
Lately it seemed harder than ever to catch his breath. Damned cigars didn't help, but he was 
too old to change now. 
The kid hadn't talked - at least not yet he hadn't. They had turned Henry Buck, Will's 
lawyer had told him; Henry, who was sixty-three and a grandfather, would have denied Christ 
three times if they had promised him a dismissal Or even a suspended sentence in return. Old 
Henry Buck was sicking up everything he knew, which fortunately wasn't a great deal. He 
knew about the fireworks and cigarettes, but that had only been two rings of what had been, 
at one time, a six- or seven-ring circus encompassing booze, hot cars, discount firearms 
(including a few machine-guns sold to gun nuts and homicidal hunters who wanted to see if 
one 'would really tear up a deer like I heard'), and stolen antiques from New England. And in 
the last couple of years, cocaine. That had been a mistake; he knew it now. Those 
Colombians down in Miami were as -crazy as shithouse rats. Come to think of it, they were 
shithouse rats. Thank Christ they hadn't caught the kid holding a pound of coke. 
Well, they were going to hurt him this time - how much or how little depended a great deal 
on that weird seventeen-year-old kid, and maybe on his weird car. Things were as delicately 
balanced as a house of cards, and Will hesitated to do or say anything, for fear he would 
change things for the worse. And there was always the possibility that Cunningham would 
laugh in his face and call him crazy. 
Will got up, cigar clamped in his jaws, and shut off his television set. He should go to bed, 
but maybe he would have a brandy first. He was always tired now, but sleep came hard. 
He turned toward the kitchen . . . and that was when the horn began to honk outside. The 
sound came over the howl of the wind in short, imperative blasts.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Will stopped cold in the kitchen doorway and belted his robe closed across his big stomach. 
His face was sharp and rapt and alive, suddenly the face of a much younger man. He stood 
there a moment longer. 
Three more short, sharp honks. 
He turned back, taking the cigar from his mouth, and walked slowly across the living room. 
An almost dreamlike sense of d–πj–∞ vu washed over him like warm water. Mixed with it was a 
feeling of fatalism. He knew it was Christine out there even before he brushed the curtain 
back and looked out, She had come for him, as he supposed he knew she might. 
The car stood at the head of his turnaround driveway, little more than a ghost in the 
membranes of blowing snow. Its lights shone out in widening cones that at last disappeared 
into the storm. For a moment it seemed to Will that someone was behind the wheel, but he 
blinked again and saw that the car was empty. As empty as it had been when it returned to the 
garage that night. 
Whonk. Whonk. Whonk-whonk. 
Almost as if it were talking. 
Will's heart thudded heavily in his chest. He turned abruptly to the phone. The time had 
come to call Cunningham after all. Call him and tell him to bring his pet demon to heel. 
He was halfway there when he heard the car's engine scream. The sound was like the shriek 
of a woman who scents treachery. A moment later there was a heavy crunch. 
Will went back to the window and was in time to see the car backing away from the high 
snowbank that fronted the end of his driveway. Its bonnet, sprayed with clods of snow, had 
crimped slightly. The engine revved again. The rear wheels spun in the powdery snow and 
then caught hold. The car leaped across the snowy road and struck the snowbank again. More 
snow exploded up and raftered away on the wind like cigar smoke blown in front of a fan. 
Never do it, Will thought. And even if you get into the driveway, what then? You think I'm 
going to come out and play? 
Wheezing more sharply than ever, he went back to the phone, looked up Cunningham's 
home number, and started to dial it. His fingers jittered, he misdialled, swore, hit the cutoff 
buttons, started again. 
Outside, Christine's engine revved. A moment later there was a crunch as she hit the 
embankment for the third time. The wind wailed and snow struck -the big picture window 
like dry sand. Will licked his lips and tried to breathe slowly. But his throat was closing up; 
he could feel it. 
The phone began to ring on the other end. Three times, Four.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Christine's engine screamed. Then the heavy thud as she hit the snowbank the passing 
ploughs had piled up at both ends of Will's semicircular driveway. 
Six rings. Seven. Nobody some. 
'Shit on it,' Will whispered, and slammed the phone back down. His face was pale, his 
nostrils flared wide, like the nostrils of an animal scenting fire upwind. His cigar had gone 
out. He threw it on the carpet and groped in his bathrobe pocket as he hurried back to the 
window. His hand found the comforting shape of his aspirator, and his fingers curled around 
its pistol grip. 
Headlights shone momentarily in his face, nearly blinding him, and Will raised his free 
hand to shield his eyes. Christine hit the snowbank again. Little by little she was bludgeoning 
her way through to the driveway. He watched her back up across the road and wished 
savagely for a plough to come along now and hit the damned thing broadside. 
No plough came. Christine came again instead, engine howling, lights glaring across his 
snow-covered lawn. She struck the snowbanks pushing mounds of snow violently to either 
side. The front end canted up and for a moment Will thought she was going to come right 
over what was left of the frozen, hard-packed embankment. Then the rear wheels lost traction 
and spun frantically. 
She backed up. 
Will's throat felt as if its bore was down to a pinhole. His lungs strained for air. He took the 
aspirator out and used it. The police. He ought to call the police. They could come. 
Cunningham's '58 couldn't get him. He was safe in his house. He was - 
Christine came again, accelerating across the road, and this time she hit the bank and came 
over it easily, front end at first tilting up, splashing the front of his house with light, then 
crashing back down. She was in the driveway. Yes, all right, but she could come no further, 
she . . . it . . . 
Christine never slowed. Still accelerating, she crossed the semicircular driveway on a 
tangent, ploughed through the shallower, looser snow of the side yard, and roared directly at 
the picture window where Will Darnell stood looking out. 
He staggered backward, gasping hard, and tripped over his own easy chair. 
Christine hit the house. The picture window exploded, letting in the shrieking wind. Glass 
flew in deadly arrows, each of them reflecting Christine's headlamps. Snow blew in and -
danced over the rug in erratic corkscrews. The headlights momentarily illuminated the room 
with the unnatural glare of a television studio, and then she withdrew, her front bumper 
dragging, her hood popped up, her grille smashed into a chrome-dripping grin full of fangs. 
Will was on his hands and knees, gagging harshly for breath, his chest heaving. He was 
vaguely aware that, had he not tripped over his chair and fallen down, he probably would 
have been cut to ribbons by flying glass. His robe had come undone and flapped behind him</p>
      <p class="calibre3">as he got to his feet. The wind streaming in the window picked up the TV Guide from the 
little table by his chair, and the magazine flew across the room to the foot of the stairs, pages 
riffling. Will got the telephone in both hands and dialled 0. 
Christine reversed along her own tracks through the snow. She went all the way back to the 
flattened snowback at the entrance to the driveway. Then she came forward, accelerating 
rapidly, and as she came the bonnet immediately began to uncrimp, the grille to regenerate 
itself. She slammed into the side of the house below the picture window again. More glass 
flew; wood splintered and groaned and creaked. The big window's low ledge cracked in two, 
and for a moment Christine's windscreen, now cracked and milky, seemed to peer in like a 
giant alien eye. 
'Police,' Will said to the operator. His voice was hardly there; it was all wheeze and whistle. 
His bathrobe flapped in the cold blizzard wind coming in through the shattered window. He 
saw that the wall below the window was nearly shattered. Broken chunks of lathing protruded 
like fractured bones. It couldn't get in, could it? Could it? 
'I'm sorry, sir, you'll have to speak up,'the operator said. 'We seem to have a very bad 
connection.' 
Police, Will said, but this time it wasn't even a whisper; only a hiss of air. Dear God, he 
was strangling, he was choking; his chest was a locked bank vault. Where was his aspirator? 
'Sir?' the operator asked doubtfully. 
There it was, on the floor. Will dropped the telephone and scrabbled for it. 
Christine came again, roaring across the lawn and striking the side of the house. This time 
the entire wall gave way in a shrapnel-burst of glass and lathing, and incredibly, 
nightmarishly, Christine's smashed and dented bonnet was in his living room, she was in, he 
could smell exhaust and hot engine. 
Christine's underworks caught on something, and she reversed back out of the ragged hole 
with a screech of pulling boards, her front end a gored ruin dusted with snow and plaster. But 
she would come again in a few seconds, and this time she might - just might - 
Will grabbed his aspirator and ran blindly for the stairs. 
He was only halfway up when the revving whine of her engine came again and he turned to 
watch, leaning on the railing more than grasping it. 
The stairwell's height lent a certain nightmare perspective. He watched Christine come 
across the snow-covered lawn, saw her bonnet fly up so that now her front end resembled the 
mouth of a huge red and white alligator. Then it snapped off altogether as she struck the 
house again, this time doing better than forty. She ripped away the last of the window frame 
and sprayed more splintered boards across his living room. Her headlights bounced upward, 
glaring, and then she was in, she was in his house, leaving a huge torn hole in the wall behind</p>
      <p class="calibre3">her with an electrical cable hanging out onto the rug like a black severed artery. Little clouds 
of blown-in fibreglass insulation danced on the cold wind like milkweed puffs. 
Will screamed and couldn't hear himself over the blatting roar of her engine. The Sears 
Muzzler silencer Arnie had put on her - one of the few things he really put on her, Will 
thought crazily - had hung up on the sill of the house, along with most of the exhaust pipe. 
'The Fury roared across the living room, knocking Will's La-Z-Boy armchair onto its side, 
where it lay like a dead pony. The floor under Christine creaked uneasily and a part of Will's 
mind screamed: Yes! Break! Break! Spill the goddam thing into the cellar! Let's see it climb 
out of there! And this image was replaced with the image of a tiger in a pit that had been dug 
and them camouflaged by wily natives. 
But the floor held - at least for the time being, it held. 
Christine roared across the living room at him. Behind, she left a zig-zag pattern of snowy 
tyre prints on the rug. She slammed into the stairs. Will was thrown back against the wall. His 
aspirator fell out of his hand and tumbled end over end all the way to the bottom. 
Christine reversed across the room, floorboards groaning underneath. Her rear end struck 
the Sony TV, and the picture tube imploded. She roared forward again and struck the side of 
the stairs again, shattering lath and gouging out plaster. Will could feel the entire structure 
grow wobbly under him. There was an awful sensation of lean. For a moment Christine was 
directly beneath him; he could look down into the oily gut of her engine compartment, could 
feel the heat of her V-8 mill. She reversed again, and Will scrambled up the stairs, heaving 
for air, clawing at the fat sausage of his throat, eyes bulging. 
He reached the top an instant before Christine hit the wall again, turning the centre of the 
stairs into a jumbled wreck. A long splinter of wood fell into her engine. The fan chewed it 
up and spat out coarse-grained sawdust and smaller splinters. The entire house smelled of gas 
and exhaust. Will's ears rang with the heavy thunder of that merciless engine. 
She backed up again. Now her tyres had chewed ragged trenches in the carpet. Down the 
hall, Will thought. Attic. Attic'll be safe. Yes, the at . . . oh God . . . oh God . . . oh my GOD - 
The final pain came with sharp, spiking suddenness. It was as if his heart had been 
punctured with an icicle. His left arm locked with pain. Still there was no breath; his chest 
heaved uselessly. He staggered backward. One foot danced out over nothingness, and then he 
fell back down the stairs in two great bone-snapping barrel rolls, legs flying over his head, 
arms waving, blue bathrobe sailing and flapping. 
He landed in a heap at the bottom and Christine pounced upon him: struck him, reversed, 
struck him again, snapped off the heavy newel post at the foot of the stairs like a twig, 
reversed, struck him again. 
From beneath the floor came the increasing mutter of supports splintering and bowing. 
Christine paused in the middle of the room for a moment, as if listening. Two of her tyres</p>
      <p class="calibre3">were flat; a third had come half off the wheel. The left side of the car was punched inward, 
scraped clean of paint in great bald patches. 
Suddenly her gearstick dropped into reverse. Her engine screamed, and she rocketed back 
across the room and out of the ragged hole in the side of Will Darnell's house, her rear end 
dropping down several inches and into the snow. The tyres spun, found some purchase, and 
pulled her out. She backed limpingly toward the road, her engine chopping and missing now, 
blue smoke hazing the air around her, oil dripping and spraying. 
At the road, she turned back toward Libertyville. The gearstick ]ever dropped into DRIVE, 
but at first the damaged transmission wouldn't catch; when it did she rolled slowly away from 
the house. Behind her, from Will's house, a broad bar of light shone out onto the churned up 
snow in a shape that was not at all like the neat rectangle of light thrown up by a window. 
The shape of the light on the snow was senseless and strange. 
She moved slowly, lurching from side to side on her flats like a very old drunk making her 
way up an alley. Snow fell thickly, driven into slanting lines by the wind. 
One of her headlights, shattered in her last destructive, trampling charge, flickered and 
came on. 
One of the tyres began to reinflate, then the other. 
The clouds of stinking oil-smoke began to diminish. 
The engine's chopping, uncertain note smoothed out. 
The missing bonnet began to reappear, from the windscreen end down, looking weirdly like 
a scarf or cardigan being knitted by invisible needles; the raw metal drew itself out of 
nothing, gleamed steel-grey, and then darkened to red as if filling with blood. 
The cracks in the windscreen began to run in reverse, leaving unflawed smoothness behind 
themselves. 
The other headlights came on, one after the other; now she moved with swift surety through 
the stormy night, behind the cutting edge of her confident brights. 
Her milometer spun smoothly backward. 
* * * * * 
Forty-five minutes later she sat in the darkness of the late Will Darnell's Do-It-Yourself 
Garage, in stall twenty. The wind howled and moaned in the ranks of the wrecks out back, 
rusting hulks that perhaps held their own ghosts and their own baleful memories as powdery 
snow swirled across the ripped and tattered seats, their balding floor carpets. 
Her engine ticked slowly, cooling.</p>
