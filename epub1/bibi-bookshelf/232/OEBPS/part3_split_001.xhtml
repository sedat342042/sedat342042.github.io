The Dealer came up to me and said,                                                                                                          
'Trade in your Fo'd,                                                                                                                             
And I'll put you in a car that'll                                                                                            
Eat up the road!                                                                                                                             
Just tell me what you want and

I'll have it brought down to you                                                                                                               
In an hour's time.'                                                                                                                          
I'm gonna get me a car                                                                                                                             
And I'll be headed on down the road;

That broken-down, ragged Ford. 
                          - Chuck Berry 
 
Arnie Cunningham's 1958 Plymouth became street-legal on the afternoon of November 1, 
1978. He finished the process, which had really begun the night he and Dennis Guilder had 
changed that first flat tyre, by paying an excise tax fee of $8.50, a municipal road tax of $2.00 
(which also enabled him to park free at the meters in the downtown area), and a licence-plate 
fee of $15.00. He was issued Pennsylvania plate HY-6241-J at the Motor Vehicle Bureau in 
Monroeville. 
He drove back from the MVB in a car Will Darnell had loaned him and rolled out of 
Darnell's Do-It-Yourself Garage behind the wheel of Christine. He drove her home. 
His father and mother arrived together from Horlicks University an hour or so later. The 
fight started almost at once. 
'Did you see it?'Arnie asked, speaking to them both but perhaps a little more to his father. 'I 
registered it just afternoon.' 
He was proud; he had reason to be. Christine had just been washed and waxed, and she 
gleamed in the late afternoon autumn sunlight. There was still a lot of rust on her, but she 
looked a thousand times better than she had on the day Arnie bought her. The rocker panels, 
like the bonnet and the back seat, were brand new. The interior was spick and span and neat 
as a pin. The glass and the chrome gleamed. 
'Yes, I - ' Michael began.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'Of course we saw it,' Regina snapped. She was making a drink, spinning a swizzle-stick in 
a Waterford glass in furious counter-clockwise circles. 'We almost ran into it. I don't want it 
parked here. The place looks like a used-car lot.' 
'Mom!' Arnie said, stunned and hurt. He looked to Michael, but Michael had left to make a 
drink of his own perhaps he had decided he was going to need it. 
'Well it does,' Regina Cunningham said, Her face was a trifle paler than usual; the rouge on 
her cheeks stood out almost like clown-colour. She knocked back half of her gin and tonic at 
a swallow, grimacing the way people grimace at the taste of bad medicine. 'Take it back 
where you had it. I don't want it here and I won't have it here, Arnie. That's final.' 
'Take it back?' Arnie said, now angry as well as hurt. 'That's great, isn't it? It's costing me 
twenty bucks a week there!' 
'It's costing you a lot more than that,' Regina said. She drained her drink and set the glass 
down. She turned to look at him. 'I took a look at your bankbook the other day - ' 
'You did what?' Arnie's eyes widened. 
She flushed a little but did not drop her eyes. Michael came back and stood in the doorway, 
looking unhappily from his wife to his son. 
'I wanted to know how much you'd been spending on that damned car,' she said. 'Is that so 
unnatural? You have to go to college next year, So far as I know they're not giving away 
many free college educations in Pennsylvania.' 
'So you just went into my room and hunted around until you found my bankbook?' Arnie 
said. His grey eyes were hard with anger, 'Maybe you were hunting for pot, too. Or girlie 
books. Or maybe come-stains on the sheets.' 
Regina's mouth dropped open. She had perhaps expected hurt and anger from him, but not 
this utter, no-holds-barred fury. 
'Arnie!' Michael roared. 
'Well, why not?' Arnie shouted back. 'I thought that was my business! God knows you spent 
enough time telling me how it was my responsibility, the both of you!' 
Regina said, 'I'm very disappointed that you feel that way, Arnold. Disappointed and hurt. 
You're behaving like - ' 
'Don't tell me how I'm behaving! How do you think I feel? I work my ass off getting the car 
street-legal - over two and a half months I worked on it - and when I bring it home, the first 
thing you say is get it out of the driveway. How am I supposed to feel? Happy?' 
'There's no reason to take that tone to your mother,' Michael said. In spite of the words, the 
tone was one of awkward conciliation. 'Or to use that sort of language.' Regina held her glass 
out to her husband. 'Make me another drink. There's a fresh bottle of gin in the pantry.'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'Dad, stay here,' Arnie said. 'Please, Let's get this over.' 
Michael Cunningham looked at his wife; his son; at his wife again. He saw flint in both 
places. He retreated to the kitchen clutching his wife's glass. 
Regina turned grimly back to her son. The wedge had been in the door since late last 
summer; she had perhaps recognized this as her last chance to kick it back out again. 
'This July you had almost four thousand dollars in the bank,' she said. 'About three-quarters 
of all the money you've made since ninth grade, plus interest - ' 
'Oh, you've really been keeping track, haven't you?' Arnie said. He sat down suddenly, 
gazing at his mother. His tone was one of disgusted surprise. 'Mom - why didn't you just take 
the damn money and put it in an account under your own name?' 
'Because,' she said,' until recently, you seemed to understand what the money was for. In 
the last couple of months it's all been car-car-car and more recently girl-girl-girl. It's as if 
you've gone insane on both subjects.' 
'Well, thanks. I can always use a nice, unprejudiced opinion on the way I'm conducting my 
life.' 
'This July you had almost four thousand dollars. For your education, Arnie. For your 
education. Now you have just over twenty-eight hundred. You can go on about snooping all 
you want - and I admit it hurts a little - but that's a fact. You've gone through twelve hundred 
dollars in two months. Maybe that's why I don't want to look at that car. You ought to be able 
to understand that. To me it looks like - ' 
'Listen - ' 
' - like a great big dollar bill flying away.' 
'Can I tell you a couple of things?' 
'No, I don't think so, Arnie,' she said with finality. 'I really don't think so.' 
Michael had come back with her glass, half full of gin. He added tonic at the bar and 
handed it to her. Regina drank, making that bitter grimace of distaste again. Arnie sat in the 
chair near the TV, looking at her thoughtfully. 
'You teach college? he said. 'You teach college and that's your attitude? “I have spoken. The 
rest of you can just shut up.” Great. I pity your students.' 
'You watch it, Arnie,' she said, pointing a finger at him. 'Just watch it.' 
'Can I tell you a couple of things or not?' 
'Go ahead. But it won't make any difference.' 
Michael cleared his throat. 'Reg, I think Arnie's right, that's hardly a constructive atti - '</p>
      <p class="calibre3">She turned on him like a cat. 'Not one word from you, either!' 
Michael flinched back. 
'The first thing is this,' Arnie said. 'If you gave my savings passbook more than a cursory 
look - and I'm sure you did - you must have noticed that my total savings went down to an 
all-time low of twenty-two hundred dollars the first week of September. I had to buy a whole 
new front-end kit for Christine.' 
'You speak as if you're proud of it,' she said angrily. 
'I am.' He met her eyes levelly. 'I put that front-end kit in myself, with no help from 
anybody. And I did a really good job. You wouldn't' - here his voice seemed to falter 
momentarily, and then firmed again - 'you wouldn't be able to tell it from the original. But my 
point is, the total savings are back up six hundred dollars from then. Because Will Darnell 
liked my work and took me on. If I can add six hundred dollars to my savings account every 
two months and I might do better if he puts me on the run over to Albany where he buys his 
used cars - there'll be forty-six hundred dollars in my account by the time school ends. And if 
I work there full-time next summer, I'll be starting college with nearly seven thousand 
dollars. And you can lay it all at the door of the car you hate so much.' 
'That won't do any good if you can't get into a good school,' she countered, shifting her 
ground deftly as she had in so many department committee meetings when someone dared to 
question one of her opinions . . . which was not often. She did not concede the point; she 
simply passed on to something else. 'Your grades have slipped.' 
'Not enough to matter,' Arnie said. 
'What do you mean, “not enough to matter”? You got deficient in Calculus! We got the red-
card just a week ago!' Red-cards, sometimes known as flunk-cards by the student body, were 
issued halfway through each marking period to students who had posted a 75-average grade 
or lower during the first five weeks of the quarter. 
'That was based on a single examination,' Arnie said calmly. 'Mr Fenderson is famous for 
giving so few exams in the first half of a quarter that you can bring home a red-card with an F 
on it because you didn't understand one basic concept, and end up with an A for the whole 
marking period. All of which I would have told you, if you'd asked. You didn't. Also, that's 
only the third red-card I've gotten since I started high school. My overall average is still 93, 
and you know how good that is - ' 
'It'll go lower!' she said shrilly, and stepped toward him. 'It's this goddam obsession with the 
car! You've got a girlfriend; I think that's fine, wonderful, super! But this car thing is insane! 
Even Dennis says - ' 
Arnie was up, and up fast, so close to her that she took a step backward, surprised out of her 
anger, at least momentarily, by his. 'You leave Dennis out of this,' he said in a deadly soft 
voice. 'This is between us.'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'All right,' she said, shifting ground once more. 'The simple fact is that your grades are 
going to go down. I know it, and your father knows it, and that mathematics red-card is an 
indication of it.' 
Arnie smiled confidently, and Regina looked wary. 
'Good,' he said. 'I tell you what. Let me keep the car here until the marking period ends. If 
I've got any grade lower than a C, I'll sell it to Darnell. He'll buy it; he knows he could get a 
grand for it in the shape it's in now. The value's not going to do anything but go up.' 
Arnie considered. 
'I'll go you one better. If I'm not on the semester honour roll, I'll also get rid of it. That 
means I'm betting my car I'll get a B in Calculus not just for the quarter but for the whole 
semester. What do you say?' 
'No,' Regina said immediately, She shot a warning look at her husband - Stay out of this. 
Michael, who had opened his mouth, closed it with a snap. 
'Why not?' Arnie asked with deceptive softness. 
'Because it's a trick, and you know it's a trick!' Regina shouted at him, her fury suddenly 
total and uncontained. 'And I'm not going to stand here any longer chewing this rag and 
listening to a lot of insolence from you! I - I changed your dirty diapers! I said get it out of 
here, drive it if you have to, but don't you leave it where I have to look at it! That's it! The 
end!' 
'How do you feel, Dad?' Arnie asked, shifting his gaze. 
Michael opened his mouth again to speak. 
'He feels as I do,' Regina said. 
Arnie looked back at her. Their eyes, the same shade of grey, met. 
'It doesn't matter what I say, does it?' 
'I think this has gone quite far e - ' 
She began to turn away, her mouth still hard and determined, her eyes oddly confused. 
Arnie caught her arm just above the elbow. 
'It doesn't, does it? Because when you've made up your mind about something, you don't 
see, you don't hear, you don't think.' 
'Arnie, stop it!' Michael shouted at him. 
Arnie looked at her and Regina looked back at him. Their eyes were frozen, locked.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'I'll tell you why you don't want to look at it,' he said in the same soft voice. 'It isn't the 
money, because the car's let me connect with a job that I'm good at and will end up making 
me money. You know that. It isn't my grades, either. They're no worse than they ever were. 
You know that, too. It's because you can't stand not to have me under your thumb, the way 
your department is, the way he is' - he jerked a thumb at Michael, who managed to look 
angry and guilty and miserable all at the same time - 'the way I always was.' 
Now Arnie's face was flushed, his hands, clenched into fists at his sides. 
'All that liberal bullshit about how the family decided things together, discussed things 
together, worked things out together, But the fact is, you were always the one who picked out 
my school-clothes, my school-shoes, who I was supposed to play with and who I couldn't, 
you decided where we were going on vacation, you told him when to trade cars and what to 
trade for. Well, this is one thing you can't run, and you fucking hate it, don't you?' 
She slapped his face. The sound was like a pistol-shot in the living room. Outside, dusk had 
fallen and cars cruised by, indistinct, their headlights like yellow eyes. Christine sat in the 
Cunninghams' asphalted driveway as she had once sat on Roland D. LeBay's lawn, but 
looking considerably better now than she had then - she looked cool and above all this ugly, 
undignified family bickering. She had, perhaps, come up in the world. 
Abruptly, shockingly, Regina Cunningham began to cry. This was a phenomenon, akin to 
rain in the desert, that Arnie had seen only four or five times in his entire life and on none of 
the other occasions had he been the cause of the tears. 
Her tears were frightening, he told Dennis later, by virtue of the simple fact that they were 
there. That was enough, but there was more - the tears made her look old in a single terrifying 
stroke, as if she had made a quantum leap from forty-five to sixty in a space of seconds. The 
hard grey shine in her gaze turned blurry and weak, and suddenly the tears were spilling 
down her cheeks, cutting through her make-up. 
She fumbled on the mantelpiece for her drink, jogged the glass instead with the tips of her 
fingers. It fell onto the hearth and shattered. A kind of incredulous silence held among the 
three of them, an amazement that things had come this far. 
And somehow, even through the weakness of the tears, she managed to say, 'I won't have it 
in our garage or in this driveway, Arnold.' 
He answered coldly, 'I wouldn't have it here, Mother.' He walked to the doorway, turned 
back, and looked at them both. 'Thanks. For being so understanding. Thanks a lot, both of 
you.' 
He left.</p>

Michael caught Arnie in the driveway, headed for Christine. He put a hand on Arnie's 
shoulder. Arnie shook it off and went on digging for his car-keys. 
'Arnie. Please.' 
Arnie turned around fast. For a moment he seemed on the verge of making that evening's 
blackness total by striking his father. Then some of the tenseness in his body subsided and he 
leaned back against the car, touching it with his left hand, stroking it, seeming to draw 
strength from it. 
'All right,' he said. 'What do you want?' 
Michael opened his mouth and then seemed unsure how to proceed. An expression of 
helplessness - it would have been funny if it hadn't been so grimly awful - spread over his 
face. He seemed to have aged, to have gone grey and haggard around the edges. 
'Arnie,' he said, seeming to force the words out against some great weight of opposing 
inertia, 'Arnie, I'm so sorry.' 
'Yeah,' Arnie said, and turned away again, opening the driver's side door. A pleasant smell 
of well-cared-for car drifted out. 'I could see that from the way you stood up for me.' 
'Please,' he said. 'This is hard for me. Harder than you know.' 
Something in his voice made Arnie turn back. His father's eyes were desperate and 
unhappy. 
'I didn't say I wanted to stand up for you,' Michael said. 'I see her side as well, you know. I 
see the way you pushed her, determined to have your own way at any cost - ' 
Arnie uttered a harsh laugh. 'Just like her, in other words.' 
'Your- mother is going through the change of life,' Michael said quietly. 'It's been extremely 
difficult for her.'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Arnie blinked at him, at first not even sure what he had heard. It was as if his father had 
suddenly said something to him in igpay atinlay; it seemed to have no more relevance to what 
they were talking about than baseball scores. 
'W-What?' 
'The change. She's frightened, and she's drinking too much, and sometimes she's in physical 
pain. Not often,' he said, seeing the alarmed look on Arnie's face, 'and she's been to the 
doctor, and the change is all it is. But she's in an emotional uproar. You're her only child, and 
the way she is now, all she can see is that she wants things to be right for you, no matter what 
the cost.' 
'She wants things her way. And that isn't anything new. She's always wanted things her 
way.' 
'That she thinks the right thing for you is whatever she thinks the right thing is goes without 
saying,' Michael said. 'But what makes you think you are so different? Or better? You were 
after her ass in there, and she knew it. So did I.' 
'She started it - ' 
'No, you started it when you brought the car home. You knew how she felt. And she's right 
about another thing. You've changed. From the first day you came home with Dennis and 
said you'd bought a car; that's when it started. Do you think that hasn't upset her? Or me? To 
have your kid start exhibiting personality traits you didn't even know existed?' 
'Hey, Dad, come on! That's a little - ' 
'We never see you, you're always working on your car or out with Leigh.' 
'You're starting to sound just like her.' 
Michael suddenly grinned - but it was a sad grin "You're wrong about that. Just as wrong as 
you can be. She sounds like her, and you sound like her, but I just sound like the guy in 
charge of some dumb UN peacekeeping force that's about to get its collective ass shot off.' 
Arnie slumped a little; his hand found the car again and began caressing, caressing. 
'All right,' he said. 'I guess I see what you mean. I don't know why you want to let her push 
you around like that, but okay.' 
The sad, humiliated grin remained, a little like the grin of a dog that has chased a 
woodchuck a long time on a hot summer day. 'Maybe some things get to be a way of life. 
And maybe there are compensations that you can't understand and I can't explain. Like . . . 
well, I love her, you know.' 
Arnie shrugged. 'So . . . what now?' 
'Can we go for a ride?'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Arnie looked surprised, then pleased. 'Sure. Hop in. Any place in particular?' 
'The airport.' 
Arnie's eyebrows went up. 'The airport? Why?' 
'I'll tell you as we go.' 
'What about Regina?' 
'Your mother's gone to bed,' Michael said quietly, and Arnie had the good grace to flush a 
little himself. 
* * * * * 
Arnie drove firmly and well. Christine's new sealed-beam headlights cut the early dark in a 
clean, deep tunnel of light. He passed the Guilders' house, then turned left onto Elm Street at 
the stop sign and started out toward JFK Drive. I-376 took them to I-278 and then out toward 
the airport. Traffic was light. The engine muttered softly through new pipes. The dashboard 
instrument panel glowed a mystic green. 
Arnie turned on the radio and found WDIL, the AM station from Pittsburgh that plays only 
oldies. Gene Chandler was chanting 'The Duke of Earl'. 
'This thing runs like a dream,' Michael Cunningham said. He sounded awed. 
'Thanks,' Arnie said, smiling. 
Michael inhaled. 'It smells new.' 
'A lot of it is. These seat covers set me back eighty bucks. Part of the money Regina was 
bitching about. I went to the library and got a lot of books and tried to copy everything the 
best I could. But it hasn't been as easy as people might think.' 
'Why not?' 
'Well, for one thing, the '58 Plymouth Fury wasn't anybody's idea of a classic car, so no one 
wrote much about it, even in the car retrospective volumes - American Car, American 
Classics, Cars of the 1950s, things like that. The '58 Pontiac was a classic, only the second 
year Pontiac made the Bonneville model; and the '58 T-Bird with the rabbit-ear fins, that was 
the last really great Thunderbird, I think; and - ' 
'I had no idea you knew so much about old cars,' Michael said. 'How long have you been 
harbouring this interest, Arnie?' 
He shrugged vaguely. 'Anyway, the other problem was just that LeBay himself customized 
the original Detroit rolling stock - Plymouth didn't offer a Fury in, red and white, for one 
thing - and I've been trying to restore the car more the way he had it than the way Detroit 
meant it to be. So I've just been sort of flying by the seat of my pants.'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'Why do you want to restore it the way LeBay had it?' 
That vague shrug again. 'I don't know. It just seems like the right thing to do.' 
'Well, I think you're doing a hell of a job.' 
'Thank you.' 
His father leaned toward him, looking at the instrument panel. 
'What are you looking at?' Arnie asked, a little sharply. 
'I'll be damned,' Michael said. 'I've never seen that before.' 
'What? Arnie glanced down. 'Oh. The milometer.' 
'It's running backward, isn't it?' 
The milometer was indeed running backward; at that time, on the evening of November 1, 
it read 79,500 and some odd miles. As Michael watched, the tenths-of-a-mile indicator rolled 
from .2 to . 1 to 0. As it went back to .9, the actual miles slipped back by one. 
Michael laughed. 'That's one thing you missed, son.' 
Arnie smiled - a small smile. 'That's right,' he said. 'Will says there's a wire crossed in there 
someplace. I don't think I'll fool with it. It's sort of neat, having a milometer that runs 
backward.' 
'Is it accurate?' 
'Huh?' 
'Well, if you go from our house to Station Square, would it subtract five miles from the 
total?' 
'Oh,' Arnie said. 'I get you. No, it's not accurate at all. Turns back two or three miles for 
every actual mile travelled. Sometimes more. Sooner or later the speedometer cable will 
break, and when I replace that, it'll take care of itself.' 
Michael, who had had a speedometer cable or two break on him in his time, glanced at the 
needle for the characteristic jitter that indicated trouble there. But the needle hung dead still 
just above forty. The speedometer seemed fine; it was only the milometer that had gotten 
funky. And did Arnie really believe that the speedometer and milometer ran off the same 
cables? Surely not. 
He laughed and said, 'That's weird, son.' 
'Why the airport?' Arnie asked.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'I'm going to treat you to a thirty-day parking stub,' Michael said. 'Five dollars. Cheaper 
than Darnell's garage. And you can get your car out whenever you want it. The airport's a 
regular stop on the bus run. End of the line, in fact.' 
'Holy Christ, that's the craziest thing I ever heard!' Arnie shouted. He pulled into the 
turnaround drive of a darkened dry cleaner's shop. 'I'm to take the bus twenty miles out to the 
airport to get my car when I need it? It's like something out of Catch-22! No! No way!' 
He was about to say something more, when he was suddenly grabbed by the neck. 
'You listen,' Michael said. 'I'm your father, so you listen to me. Your mother was right, 
Arnie. You've gotten unreasonable - more than unreasonable - in the last couple of months. 
You've gotten downright peculiar.' 
'Let go of me,' Arnie said, struggling in his father's grip. 
Michael didn't let go, but he loosened up. 'I'll put it in perspective for you,' he said. 'Yes, the 
airport is a long way to come, but the same quarter that would take you to Darnell's will take 
you out here. There are parking garages closer in, but there are more incidents of theft and 
vandalism in the city. The airport is, by contrast, quite safe.' 
'No public parking lot is safe.' 
'Second, it's cheaper than a downtown garage and much cheaper than Darnell's.' 
'That's not the point, and you know it!' 
'Maybe you're right,' Michael said. 'But you're missing something too, Arnie. You're 
missing the real point.' 
'Well suppose you tell me what the real point is.' 
'All right. I will.' Michael paused for a moment, looking steadily at his son. When he spoke 
his voice was low and even, almost as musical as his recorder. 'Along with any sense of what 
is reasonable, you seem to have totally lost your sense of perspective. You're almost eighteen, 
in your last year at public school. I think you've made up your mind not to go to Horlicks; 
I've seen the college brochures you've brought home - ' 
'No, I'm not going to Horlicks,' Arnie said. He sounded a little calmer now. 'Not after all of 
this. You have no idea how badly I want to get away. Or maybe you do.' 
'Yes. I do. And maybe that's best. Better than this constant abrasion between you and your 
mother. All I ask is that you not tell her yet; wait until you have to submit the application 
papers.' 
Arnie shrugged, promising nothing either way. 
'You'll be taking your car to school, that is if it's still running - ' 
'It'll be running.'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">' - and if it's a school that allows freshmen to have cars on campus.' 
Arnie turned toward his father, surprised out of his smouldering anger - surprised and 
uneasy. This was a possibility he had never considered. 
'I won't go to a school that says I can't have my wheels,' he said. His tone was one of patient 
instruction, the sort of voice an instructor with a class of mentally retarded children might 
use. 
'You see?' Michael asked. 'She's right. Basing your choice of a college on the school's 
policy concerning freshmen and cars is totally irrational. You've gotten obsessed with this 
car.' 
'I wouldn't expect you to understand.' 
Michael pressed his lips together for a moment. 
'Anyway, what's running out to the airport on the bus to pick up your car, if you want to 
take Leigh out? It's an inconvenience, granted, but not really a major one. It means you won't 
use it unless you have to, for one thing, and you'll save gas money. Your mother can have her 
little victory, she won't have to look at it.' Michael paused and then smiled his sad grin again. 
'She doesn't see it as money flying away, both of us know that. She sees it as your first 
decisive step away from her . . . from us, I guess she . . . oh, shit, I don't know.' 
He stopped, looking at his son. Arnie looked back thoughtfully, 
'Take it to college with you; even if you choose a campus that doesn't allow freshmen to 
have cars on campus, there are ways to get around - ' 
'Like parking it at the airport?' 
'Yes. Like that. When you come home for weekends, Regina will be so glad to see you 
she'll never mention the car. Hell, she'll probably get out there in the driveway and help you 
wash it and Turtlewax it just so she can find out what you're doing. Ten months. Then it'll be 
over. We can have peace in the family again. Go on, Arnie. Drive.' 
Arnie pulled out of the dry cleaner's and back into traffic. 
'Is this thing insured?' Michael asked abruptly. 
Arnie laughed. 'Are you kidding? If you don't have' liability insurance in this state and you 
get in an accident, the cops kill you. Without liability, it'd be your fault even if the other car 
fell out of the sky and landed on top of you. It's one of the ways the shitters keep kids off the 
roads in Pennsylvania.' 
Michael thought of telling Arnie that a disproportionate number of fatal accidents in 
Pennsylvania - 41 per cent - involved teenage drivers (Regina had read the statistic to him as 
part of a Sunday supplement article, rolling that figure out in slow, apocalyptic tones: 'For-ty</p>
      <p class="calibre3">one per cent! shortly after Arnie bought his car), and decided it wasn't anything Arnie would 
want to hear . . . not in his present mood. 
'Just liability?' 
They were passing under a reflecting sign which read LEFT LANE FOR AIRPORT. Arnie 
put on his blinker and changed lanes. Michael seemed to relax a little. 
'You can't get collision insurance until you're twenty-one. I mean that; those shitting 
insurance companies are all as rich as Croesus, but they won't cover you unless the odds are 
stacked outrageously in their favour.' There was a bitter, somehow weakly peevish note in 
Arnie's voice that Michael had never heard there before, and although he said nothing, he was 
startled and a little dismayed by his son's choice of words - he had assumed Arnie used that 
sort of language with his peers (or so he later told Dennis Guilder, apparently totally unaware 
of the fact that, up until his senior year, Arnie had really had no peers except for Guilder), but 
he had never used it in front of Regina and himself. 
'Your driving record and whether or not you had driver ed don't have anything to do with 
it,' Arnie went on. 'The reason you can't get collision is because their fucking actuarial tables 
say you can't get collision. You can get it at twenty-one only if you're willing to spend a 
fortune - usually the premiums end up being more than the car books for until you're twenty-
three or so, unless you're married. Oh, the shitters have got it all figured out. They know how 
to walk it right to you, all right.' 
Up ahead the airport lights glowed, runways outlined in mystic parallels of blue light. 'If 
anyone ever asks me what the lowest form of human life is, I'll tell them it's an insurance 
agent.' 
'You've made quite a study of it,' Michael commented. He didn't quite dare to say anything 
else; Arnie seemed only waiting to fly into a fresh rage. 
'I went around to five different companies. In spite of what Mom said, I'm not anxious to 
throw my money away.' 
'And straight liability was the best you could do?' 
'Yeah, that's right. Six hundred and fifty dollars a year.' 
Michael whistled. 
'That's right,' Arnie agreed. 
Another twinkling sign, advising that the two left-hand lanes were for parking, the right 
lanes for departures. At the entrance to the parking lot, the way split again. To the right was 
an automated gate where you took a ticket for short-term parking. To the left was the glass 
booth where the parking-lot attendant sat, watching a small black-and-white TV and smoking 
a cigarette.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Arnie sighed. 'Maybe you're right. Maybe this is the best solution all the way around.' . 
'Of course it is,' Michael said, relieved. Arnie sounded more like his old self now, and that 
hard light had died out of his eyes at last. 'Ten months, that's all.' 
'Sure.'    
He drove up to the booth, and the attendant, a young guy in a black-and-orange high school 
sweater with the Libertyville logo on the pockets, pushed back the glass partition and leaned 
out. 'Help ya?' 
'I'd like a thirty-day ticket,' Arnie said, digging for his wallet. 
Michael put his hand over Arnie's. 'This one's my treat,' he said. 
Arnie pushed his hand away gently but firmly and took his wallet out. 'It's my car,' he said. 
'I'll pay my own way.' 
'I only wanted - ' Michael began. 
'I know,' Arnie said. 'But I mean it.' 
Michael sighed. 'I know you do. You and you mother. Everything will be fine if you do it 
my way.' 
Arnie's lips tightened momentarily, and then he smiled. 'Well . . . yeah,' he said. 
They looked at each other and both burst out laughing. 
At the instant that they did, Christine stalled. Up until then the engine had been ticking over 
with unobtrusive perfection. Now it just quit; the oil and amp dash lamps came on. 
Michael raised his eyebrows. 'Say what?' 
'I don't know,' Arnie answered, frowning. 'It never did that before.' 
He turned the key, and the engine started at once. 
'Nothing, I guess,' Michael said. 
'I'll want to check the timing later in the week,' Arnie muttered. He gunned the engine and 
listened carefully. And in that instant, Michael thought that Arnie didn't look like his son at 
all. He looked like someone else, someone much older and harder. He felt a brief but 
extremely nasty lance of fear in his chest. 
'Hey, do you want this ticket or are you just gonna sit there all night talkin about your 
timing?' the parking-lot attendant asked. He looked vaguely familiar to Arnie, the way people 
do when you've seen them moving around in the corridors at school but don't have anything 
else to do with them.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'Oh yeah. Sorry.' Arnie passed him a five-dollar bill, and the attendant gave him a time-
ticket. 
'Back of the lot,' the attendant said. 'Be sure to revalidate it five days before the end of the 
month if you want the same space again.' 
'Right.' 
Arnie drove to he back of the lot, Christine's shadow growing and shrinking as they passed 
under the hooded arc-sodium lights. He found a vacant space and backed Christine in. As he 
turned off the key, he grimaced and put a hand to his lower back. 
'That still bothering you?' Michael asked. 
'Only a little,' Arnie said. 'I was almost over it, and it came back on me yesterday. I must 
have lifted something wrong. Don't forget to lock your door.' 
They got out and locked up. Once out of the car, Michael felt better - he felt closer to his 
son, and, maybe just as important, he felt less that he had played the impotent fool with his 
jingling cap of bells in the argument that had taken place earlier. Once out of the car, he felt 
as if he might have salvaged something - maybe a lot - out of the night. 
'Let's see how fast that bus really is,' Arnie said, and they began to walk across the parking 
lot toward the terminal, companionably close together. 
Michael had formed an opinion of Christine on the ride out to the airport. He was impressed 
with the job of restoration Arnie had done, but he disliked the car itself disliked it intensely. 
He supposed it was ridiculous to hold such feelings about an inanimate object, but the dislike 
was there all the same, big and unmistakable, like a lump in the throat. 
The source of the dislike was impossible to isolate. It had caused bitter trouble in the 
family, and he supposed that was the real reason . . . but it wasn't all. He hadn't liked the way 
Arnie seemed when he was behind the wheel: somehow arrogant and petulant at the same 
time, like a weak king. The impotent way he had railed about the insurance . . . his use of that 
ugly and striking word 'shitters' . . . even the way the car had stalled when they laughed 
together. 
And it had a smell. You didn't notice it right away, but it was there. Not the smell of new 
seat covers, that was quite pleasant; this was an undersmell, bitter, almost (but not quite) 
secret. It was an old smell. Well, Michael told himself, the car is old, why in God's name do 
you expect it to smell new? And that made undeniable sense. In spite of the really fantastic 
job Arnie had done of restoring it, the Fury was twenty years old. That bitter, mouldy smell 
might be coming from old carpeting in the boot, or old matting under the new floormats; 
perhaps it was coming from the original padding under the bright new seat covers. Just a 
smell of age. 
And yet that undersmell, low and vaguely sickening, bothered him. It seemed to come and 
go in waves, sometimes very noticeable, at other times completely undetectable. It seemed to</p>
      <p class="calibre3">have no specific source. At its worst, it smelled like the rotting corpse of some small animal - 
a cat, a woodchuck, maybe a squirrel - that had gotten into the boot-or maybe crawled up into 
the frame and then died there. 
Michael was proud of what his son had accomplished . . . and very glad to get out of his 
son's car.</p>

Then I drove past the Stop and Shop.

Cause I had the radio on. 
- Jonathan Richmond and the      
   Modern Lovers 
 
The parking-lot-attendant that night - every night from six until ten, as a matter of fact - 
was a young man named Sandy Galton, the only one of Buddy Repperton's close circle of 
hoodlum friends who had not been in the smoking area on the day Repperton had been 
expelled from school. Arnie didn't recognize him, but Galton recognized Arnie. 
* * * * * 
Buddy Repperton, out of school and with no interest in initiating the procedures that might 
have gotten him readmitted at the beginning of the spring semester in January, had gone to 
work at the gas station run by Don Vandenberg's father. In the few weeks he had been there, 
he had already begun a number of fairly typical scams - shortchanging gas customers who 
looked as if they might be in too big a hurry to count the bills he gave back to them, running 
the remould game (which consists of charging the customer for a new tyre and then actually 
putting on a remould and pocketing the fifteen- to sixty-dollar difference), running the similar 
used-parts game, plus selling inspection stickers to kids from the high school and nearby 
Horlicks - kids desperate to keep their death-traps on the road. 
The station was open twenty-four hours a day, and Buddy worked the late shift, from 9 PM. 
to 5 AM. Around eleven o'clock, Moochie Welch and Sandy Galton were apt to drop by in 
Sandy's old dented Mustang; Richie Trelawney might come by in his Firebird; and Don, of 
course, was in and out almost all the time - when he wasn't goofing off at school. By 
midnight on any given weekend there might be six or eight guys sitting around in the office, 
drinking beer out of dirty teacups, passing around a bottle of Buddy's Texas Driver, doing a 
joint or maybe a little hash, farting, telling dirty jokes, swapping lies about how much pussy 
they were getting, and maybe helping Buddy fiddle around with whatever was up on the lift. 
During one of these late-night gatherings in early November, Sandy happened to mention 
that Arnie Cunningham was parking his machine in the long-term lot out at the airport. He 
had, in fact, bought a thirty-day ticket.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Buddy, whose usual demeanour during these late-night bull-sessions was one of sullen 
withdrawal, tipped his cheap contour-plastic chair abruptly back down on all four legs and 
put his bottle of Driver down on the windscreen-wiper cabinet with a bang. 
'What did you say?' he asked. 'Cunningham? Ole Cuntface?' 
'Yeah,' Sandy said, surprised and a little uneasy. 'That's him.' 
'You sure? The guy who got me kicked out of school?' Sandy looked at him with mounting 
alarm. 'Yeah. Why?' 
'And he's got a thirty-day ticket, which means he's parked in the long-term lot?' 
'Yeah. Maybe his folks didn't want him to have it at . . . ' 
Sandy trailed off. Buddy Repperton had begun to smile. It was not a pleasant sight, that 
smile, and not only because the teeth it revealed were already going rotten. It was as if, 
somewhere, some terrible machinery had just whined into life and was beginning to cycle up 
and up to full running speed. 
Buddy looked around from Sandy to Don to Moochie Welch to Richie Trelawney. They 
looked back at him, interested and a little scared. 
'Cuntface,' he said in a soft, marvelling voice. 'Ole Cuntface got his machine street-legal 
and his funky folks have got him parking it out at the airport.' 
He laughed. 
Moochie and Don exchanged a glance that was somehow both uneasy and eager. 
Buddy leaned toward them, elbows on the knees of his jeans. 
'Listen,' he said.</p>

WDIL was on the car radio and Dion was singing 'Run-around Sue' in his tough, streetwise 
voice, but neither of them was listening. 
His hand had slipped up under the T-shirt she was wearing and had found the soft glory of 
her breasts, capped with nipples that were tight and hard with excitement. Her breath came in 
short, steep gasps. And for the first time her hand had gone where he wanted it, where he 
needed it, into his lap, where it pressed and turned and moved, without experience but with 
enough desire to make up for the lack. 
He kissed her and her mouth opened wide, her tongue Was there, and the kiss was like 
inhaling the clean aroma/taste of a rain forest. He could feel excitement and arousal coming 
off her like a glow. 
He leaned toward her, strained toward her, all of him, and for a moment he could feel her 
respond with a pure, clean passion. 
Then she was gone. 
Arnie sat there, dazed and stupefied, a little to the right of the steering wheel, as Christine's 
dome-tight came on. It was brief; the passenger door clunked solidly shut and the light 
clicked off again. 
He sat a moment longer, not sure what had happened, momentarily not even sure of where 
he was. His body was in a complete stew - a helter-skelter array of emotions and erratic 
physical reactions that were half wonderful and half terrible. His glands hurt; his penis was 
hard iron; his balls throbbed dully. He could feel adrenalin whipping rapidly through his 
bloodstream, up and down and all around. 
He made a fist and brought it down on his leg, hard. Then he slid across the seat, opened 
the door, and went after her. 
Leigh was standing on the very edge of the Embankment, looking down into the darkness. 
Within a bright rectangle in the middle of that darkness, Sylvester Stallone strode across the</p>
      <p class="calibre3">night in the costume of a young labour leader from the 1930s. Again Arnie had that feeling of 
living in some marvellous dream that might at any moment skew off into nightmare . . . 
perhaps it had already begun to happen. 
She was too close to the edge - he took her arm and pulled her gently backward. The 
ground up here was dry and crumbly. There was no fence or guardrail. If the earth at the edge 
let go, Leigh would be gone; she would land somewhere in the suburban development loosely 
scattered around the Liberty Hill Drive-In. 
The Embankment had been the local lovers' lane since time out of mind. It was at the end of 
Stanson Road, a long, meandering stretch of two-lane blacktop that first curved out of town 
and then hooked back toward it, dead-ending on Libertyville Heights, where there had once 
been a farm. 
It was November 4, and the rain that had begun earlier that Saturday night had turned to a 
light sleet. They had the Embankment and the free (if silent) view of the drive-in to 
themselves. He got her back into the car - she came willingly enough - thinking it was sleet 
on her cheeks. It was only inside, by the ghostly green glow of the dashboard lights, that he 
saw for sure she was crying. 
'What's the matter?' he asked. 'What's wrong?' 
She shook her head and cried harder. 
'Did I . . . was it something you didn't want to do?' He swallowed and made himself say it. 
'Touch me like that?' 
She shook her head again, but he wasn't sure what that meant. Arnie held her, clumsy and 
worried. And in the back of his mind he was thinking about the sleet, the trip back down, and 
the fact that he had no snow tyres on Christine as yet. 
'I never did that for any boy,' she said against his shoulder. 'That's the first time I ever 
touched . . . you know. I did it because I wanted to. Because I wanted to, that's all.' 
'Then what is it?' 
'I can't . . . here.' The words came out slowly and painfully, one at a time, with an almost 
awful reluctance. 
'The Embankment?' Arnie said. gazing around, thinking stupidly that maybe she thought he 
had really brought them up here so they would watch F.I.S.T free. 
'In this car!' she shouted at him suddenly. 'I can't make love to you in this car!' 
'Huh?' He stared at her, thunderstruck. 'What are you talking about? Why not?' 
'Because . because . . . I don't know!' She struggled to say something else and then burst 
into fresh tears. Arnie held her again until she quieted.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'It's just that I don't know which you love more,' Leigh said when she was able. 
'That's . . . ' Arnie paused, shook his head, smiled. 'Leigh, that's crazy.' 
'Is it?' she asked, searching his face. 'Which of us do you spend more time with? Me . . . or 
her?' 
'You mean Christine?' He looked around him, smiling that puzzled smile that she could find 
either lovely and lovable or horridly hateful - sometimes both at once. 
'Yes,' she said tonelessly. 'I do.' She looked down at her hands, lying lifelessly on her blue 
woollen slacks. 'I suppose it's stupid.' 
'I spend a lot more time with you,' Arnie said. He shook his head. 'This is crazy. Or maybe 
it's normal - maybe it just seems crazy to me because I never had a girl before.' He reached 
out and touched the fall of her hair where it spilled over one shoulder of her open coat. The 
T-shirt beneath read GIVE ME LIBERTYVILLE OR GIVE ME DEATH, and her nipples poked 
at the thin cotton cloth in a sexy way that made Arnie feel a little delirious. 
'I thought girls were supposed to be jealous of other girls. Not cars.' 
Leigh laughed shortly. 'You're right. It must be because you've never had a girl before. Cars 
are girls. Didn't you know that?' 
'Oh, come, on - ' 
'Then why don't you call this Christopher?' And she suddenly slammed her open palm 
down on the seat, hard. Arnie winced. 
'Come on, Leigh. Don't.' 
'Don't like me slapping your girl? she asked with sudden and unexpected venom. Then she 
saw the hurt look in his eyes. 'Arnie, I'm sorry.' 
'Are you?' he asked, looking at her expressionlessly. 'Seems like nobody likes my car these 
days - you, my dad and mom, even Dennis. I worked my ass off on it, and it means zero to 
everybody.' 
'It means something to me,' she said softly. 'The effort it took.' 
'Yeah,' he said morosely. The passion, the heat, had fled. He felt cold and a little sick to his 
stomach. 'Look, we better get going. I don't have any snow tyres. Your folks'd think it was 
cute, us going bowling and then getting racked up on Stanson Road.' 
She giggled. 'They don't know where Stanson Road ends up. 
He cocked an eyebrow at her, some of his good humour returning. 'That's what you think,' 
he said.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">He drove back down toward town slowly, and Christine managed the twisting, steeply 
descending road with easy surefootedness. The sprinkle of earth-stars that was Libertyville 
and Monroeville grew larger and drew closer together and then ceased to have any pattern at 
all. Leigh watched this a little sadly, feeling that the best part of potentially wondei7ful 
evening had somehow slipped away. She felt irritated, chafed, out of sorts with herself - 
unfulfilled, she supposed. There was a dull ache in her breasts. She didn't know if she had 
meant to let him go what was euphemistically known as 'all the way' or not, but after things 
had reached a certain point, nothing had gone as she had hoped . . . all because she had to 
open her big fat mouth. 
Her body was in a mess, and her thoughts were the same way. Again and again on the 
mostly silent drive back down she opened her mouth to try to clarify how she felt . . . and 
then closed it again, afraid of being misunderstood, because she didn't understand how she 
felt herself. 
She didn't feel jealous of Christine . . . and yet she did. About that Arnie hadn't told the 
truth. She had a good idea of how much time he spent tinkering on the car, but was that so 
wrong? He was good with his hands, he liked to work on it, and it ran like a watch . . . except 
for that funny little glitch with the milometer numbers running backward. 
Cars are girls, she had said. She hadn't been thinking of what she was saying; it had just 
popped out of her mouth. And it certainly wasn't always true; she didn't think of their family 
sedan as having any particular gender; it was just a Ford. 
But - 
Forget it, jet rid of all the hocus-pocus and phony stuff. The truth was much more brutal 
and even crazier, wasn't it? She couldn't make love to him, couldn't touch him in that intimate 
way, much less think about bringing him to a climax that way (or the other, the real way - she 
had turned that over and over in her mind as she lay in her narrow bed, feeling a new and 
nearly amazing excitement steal over her), in the car. 
Not in the car. 
Because the realty crazy part was that she felt Christine was watching them. That she was 
jealous, disapproving, maybe hating. Because there were times (like tonight, as Arnie skated 
the Plymouth so smoothly and delicately across the building scales of sleet) when she felt that 
the two of them - Arnie and Christine - were welded together in a disturbing parody of the-act 
of love. Because Leigh did not feel that she rode in Christine; when she got in to go 
somewhere with Arnie she felt swallowed in Christine. And the act of kissing him, making 
love to him, seemed a perversion worse than voyeurism or exhibitionism - it was like making 
love inside the body of her rival. 
The really crazy part of it was that she hated Christine. 
Hated her and feared her. She had developed a vague dislike of walking in front of the new 
grille, or closely behind the boot; she had vague thoughts of the emergency brake letting go</p>
      <p class="calibre3">or the gearstick popping out of park and into neutral for some reason. Thoughts she had never 
had about the family sedan. 
But mostly it was not wanting to do anything in the car . . . or even go anywhere in the car, 
if she could help it. Arnie seemed somehow different in the car, a person she didn't really 
know. She loved the feel of his hands on her body - her breasts, her thighs (she had not yet 
allowed him to touch the centre of her, but she wanted his hands there; she thought if he 
touched her there she would probably just melt). His touch always brought a coppery taste of 
excitement to her mouth, a feeling that every sense was alive and deliciously attuned. But in 
the car that feeling seemed blunted . . . maybe because in the car Arnie seemed less honestly 
passionate and somehow more lecherous. 
She opened her mouth again as they turned onto her street, wanting to explain some of this, 
and again nothing would come. Why should it? There was really nothing to explain - it was 
all vapours. Nothing but vague burnouts. 
Well . . . there was one thing. But she couldn't tell him that; it would hurt him too badly. 
She didn't want to hurt him because she thought she was beginning to love him. 
But it was there. 
The smell - a rotten, thick smell under the aromas of new seat covers and the cleaning fluid 
he had used on the floormats. It was there, faint but terribly unpleasant. Almost stomach-
turning. 
As if, at some time, something had crawled into the car and died there. 
* * * * * 
He kissed her good night on her doorstep, the sleet shining silver in the cone of yellow light 
thrown by the carriage lamp at the foot of the porch steps. It shone in her dark blond hair like 
jewels. He would have liked to have really kissed her, but the fact that her parents might be 
watching from the living room - probably were, in fact - forced him to kiss her almost 
formally, as you might kiss a dear cousin. 
'I'm sorry,' she said. 'I was silly.' 
'No,' Arnie said, obviously meaning yes. 
'It's just that' - and her mind supplied her with something that was a curious hybrid of the 
truth and a lie - 'that it doesn't seem right in the car. Any car. I want us to be together, but not 
parked in the dark at the end of a dead-end road. Do you understand?' 
'Yes,' he said. Up at the Embankment, in the car, he had felt a little angry with her . . . well, 
to be honest, he had been pretty goddam pissed off. But now, standing here on her stoop, he 
thought he could understand - and marvel that he could want to deny her anything or cross 
her will in any way. 'I know exactly what you mean.'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">She hugged him, her arms locked around his neck. Her coat was still open, and he could 
feel the soft, maddening weight of her breasts. 
'I love you,' she said for the first time, and then slipped inside to leave him standing there 
on the porch momentarily, agreeably stunned, and much warmer than he should have been in 
the ticking, pattering sleet of late autumn. 
The idea that the Cabots might find it peculiar if he stood on their front stoop much longer 
in the sleet at last percolated down into his bemused brain. Arnie went back down the walk 
through the tick and patter, snapping his fingers and grinning. He was riding the rollercoaster 
now, the one that's the best ride, the one they really only let you take once. 
Near the place where the concrete path joined the sidewalk, he stopped, the smile fading off 
his face. Christine stood at the kerb, drops of melted sleet pearling her glass, smearing the red 
dash lights from the inside. He had left Christine running, and she had stalled. This was the 
second time. 
'Wet wires,' he muttered under his breath. 'That's all.' It couldn't be plugs; he had put in a 
whole new set just the day before yesterday, at Will's. Eight new Champions and - 
Which of us do you spend more time with? Me . . . or her? 
The smile returned, but this time it was uneasy. Well, he spent more time around cars in 
general - of course. That came of working for Will. But it was ridiculous to think that . . . 
You lied to her. That's the truth, isn't it? 
No, he answered himself uneasily. No, I don't think you could say I really lied to her. . . 
No? Then just what do you call it? 
For the first and only time since he had taken her to the football game at Hidden Hills, he 
had told her a big fat lie. Because the truth was, he spent more time with Christine, and he 
hated having her parked in the thirty-day section of the airport parking lot, out in the wind 
and the rain, soon to be snow - 
He had lied to her. 
He spent more time with Christine. 
And that was - 
Was - 
'Wrong,' he croaked, and the word was almost lost in the slick, mysterious sound of the 
falling sleet. 
He stood on the walk, looking at his stalled car, marvellously resurrected time traveller 
from the era of Buddy Holly and Khrushchev and Laika the Space Dog, and suddenly he 
hated it. It had done something to him, he wasn't sure what. Something.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">The dash lights, blurred into football-shaped red eyes by the moisture on the window, 
seemed to mock him and reproach him at the same time. 
He opened the driver's side door, slipped behind the wheel, and pulled the door shut again. 
He closed his eyes. Peace flowed over him and things seemed to come back together. He had 
lied to her, yes, but it was a little lie. A mostly unimportant lie. No - a completely unimportant 
lie. 
He reached out without opening his eyes and touched the leather rectangle the keys were 
attached to - old and scuffed, the initials R.D.L. burned into it. He had seen no need to get a 
new keyring, or a piece of leather with his own initials on it. 
But there was something peculiar about the leather tab the keys were attached to, wasn't 
there? Yes. Quite peculiar indeed. 
When he had counted out the cash on LeBay's kitchen table and LeBay had skittered the 
keys across the red-and-white-checked oilcloth to him, the rectangle of leather had been 
scuffed and nicked and darkened by age, the initials almost obliterated by time and the 
constant friction of rubbing against the change in the old man's pocket and the material of the 
pocket itself. 
Now the initials stood out fresh and clear again. They had been renewed. 
But, like the lie, that was really unimportant. Sitting inside the metal shell of Christine's 
body, he felt very strongly that that was true. 
He knew it. Quite unimportant, all of it. 
He turned the key. The starter whined, but for a long time the engine wouldn't catch. Wet 
wires. Of course that was what it was. 
'Please,' he whispered. 'It's all right, don't worry, everything is the same.' 
The engine fired, missed. The starter whined on and on. Sleet ticked coldly on the glass. It 
was safe in here; it was dry and warm. If the engine would start. 
'Come on,' Arnie whispered. 'Come on, Christine. Come on, hon.' 
The engine fired again, caught. The dash lights flickered and went out. The IGN light 
pulsed weakly again as the motor stuttered, then went out for good as the beat of the engine 
smoothed out into a clean hum. 
The heater blew warm air gently around his legs, negating the winter chill outside. 
It seemed to him that there were things Leigh could not understand, things she could never 
understand. Because she hadn't been around. The pimples. The cries of Hey Pizza-Face! The 
wanting to speak, the wanting to reach out to other people, and the inability. The impotence. 
It seemed to him that she couldn't understand the simple fact that, had it not been for 
Christine, he never would have had the courage to call her on the phone even if she had gone</p>
      <p class="calibre3">around with I WANT TO DATE ARNIE CUNNINGHAM tattooed on her forehead. She couldn't 
understand that he sometimes felt thirty years older than his age - no! more like fifty! and not 
a boy at all but some terribly hurt veteran back from an undeclared war. 
He caressed the steering wheel. The green cats' eyes of the dash instruments glowed back at 
him comfortingly. 
'Okay,' he said. Almost sighed. 
He dropped the gearshift into big D and flicked on the radio. Dee Dee Sharp singing 
'Mashed Potato Time'; mystic nonsense on the radio waves coming out of the dark. 
He pulled out, planning to head for the airport, where he would park his car and catch the 
bus that ran back to town on the hour. And he did that, but not in time to take the 11:00 PM 
bus as he had intended. He took the midnight bus instead, and it was not until he was in bed 
that night recalling Leigh's warm kisses instead of the way Christine wouldn't fire up, that it 
occurred to him that somewhere that evening, after leaving the Cabot house and before 
arriving at the airport, he had lost an hour. It was so obvious that he felt like a man who has 
turned the house upside down looking for a vital bit of correspondence, only to discover that 
he has been holding it in his other hand all along. Obvious . . . and a little scary. 
Where had he been? 
He had a blurry memory of drawing away from the kerb in front of Leigh's and then just . . . 
. . . just cruising. 
Yeah. Cruising. That was all. No big deal. 
Cruising through the thickening sleet, cruising empty streets that were plated with the stuff, 
cruising without snow tyres (and yet Christine, incredibly surefooted, never missed her way 
or skidded around a corner, Christine seemed to find the safe and secure way as if by magic, 
the ride as solid as it would have been if the car had been on trolley-tracks), cruising with the 
radio on, spilling out a constant stream of oldies that seemed to consist solely of girls' names: 
Peggy Sue, Carol, Barbara-Ann, Susie Darlin'. 
It seemed to him that at some point he had gotten a little frightened and had punched one of 
the chrome buttons on the converter he'd installed, but instead of FM-104 and the Block Party 
Weekend he got WDIL all over again, only now the disc jockey sounded crazily like Alan 
Freed, and the voice that followed was that of Screamin' Jay Hawkins, hoarse and chanting: 'I 
put a spell on youuu . . . because you're miiiiiine.. . . ' 
And then at last there had been the airport with its foul-weather lights pulsing sequentially 
like a visible heartbeat. Whatever had been on the radio faded to a meaningless jumble of 
static and he had turned it off. Getting out of the car he had felt a sweaty, incomprehensible 
sort of relief. 
* * * * *</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Now he lay in bed, needing to sleep but unable, The sleet had thickened and curdled into fat 
white splats of snow. 
It wasn't right. 
Something had been started, something was going on. He couldn't even lie to himself and 
say that he didn't know about it. The car - Christine - several people had commented on how 
beautifully he had restored her. He had driven it to school and the kids from auto shop were 
all over it; they were underneath it on crawlers to look at the new exhaust system, the new 
shocks, the bodywork. They were waist-deep in the engine compartment, checking out the 
belts and the radiator, which was miraculously free of the corrosion and the green gunk that is 
the residue of years of antifreeze, checking out the generator and the tight, gleaming pistons 
socketed in their valves. Even the air cleaner was new, with the numbers 318 painted across-
the top, raked backward to indicate speed. 
Yes, he had become something of a hero to his fellow shoppies, and he had taken all the 
comments and the compliments with just the night deprecatory grin. But even then, hadn't the 
confusion been there, somewhere deep inside? Sure. 
Because he couldn't remember what he had done to Christine and what he hadn't. 
The time spent working on her at Darnell's was nothing but a blur now, like his ride out to 
the airport earlier this evening had been. He could remember starting the bodywork on the 
dented rear end, but he couldn't remember finishing it. He could remember painting the hood 
- covering the windscreen and mudguards with masking tape and donning the white mask in 
the paint-shop out back - but exactly when he had replaced the springs he couldn't remember. 
Nor could he remember where he had gotten them. All he could remember for sure was 
sitting behind the wheel for long periods, stupefied with happiness . . . feeling the way he had 
felt when Leigh whispered 'I love you' before slipping in her front door. Sitting there after 
most of the guys who worked on their cars at Darnell's had gone home to get their suppers. 
Sitting there and sometimes turning on the radio to listen to the oldies on WDIL. 
Maybe the windscreen was the worst. 
He hadn't bought a new windscreen for Christine, he was sure of that. His bankbook would 
be dented a lot more than it was if he'd bought one of those fancy wrap jobs. And wouldn't he 
have a receipt? He had even hunted for such a receipt once in the desk-file marked CAR 
STUFF that he kept in his room. But he hadn't found one, and the truth was, he had hunted 
rather halfheartedly. 
Dennis had said something - that the snarl of cracks had looked smaller, less serious. Then, 
that day at Hidden Hills, it had just been . . . well, gone. The windscreen had been clean and 
unflawed. 
But when had it happened? How had it happened? 
He didn't know.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">He finally fell asleep and dreamed unpleasantly, twisting the covers into a ball as the scud 
of clouds blew away and the autumnal stars shone coldly down.</p>

                           - Woody Guthrie 
 
It was a dream - she was sure, almost until the very end, that it must be a dream. 
In the dream she awoke from a dream of Arnie, making love to Arnie not in the car but in a 
very cool blue room that was unfurnished except for a deep blue shag rug and a scatter of 
throw-pillows covered in a lighter blue satin . . . she awoke from this dream to her room in 
the small hours of Sunday morning. 
She could hear a car outside. She went to the window and looked out and down. 
Christine was standing at the kerb. She was running - Leigh could see exhaust raftering up 
from the pipes - but was empty. In the dream she thought that Arnie must be at the door, 
although there was no knock as yet. She ought to go down, and quickly. If her father woke up 
and found Arnie here at four in the morning, he would be furious. 
But she didn't move. She looked down at the car and thought how much she hated it - and 
feared it. 
And it hated her, too. 
Rivals, she thought, and the thought - in this dream - was not grim and hotly jealous but 
rather despairing and afraid. There it sat at the kerb, there it was - there she was - parked 
outside her house in the dead trench of morning, waiting for her. Waiting for Leigh. Come on 
down, honey. Come on. We'll cruise, and we'll talk about who needs him more, who cares for 
him more, and who will be better for him in the long run. Come on . . . you're not scared, are 
you? 
She was terrified. 
It's not fair, she's older, she knows the tricks, she'll beguile him - 
'Get out,' Leigh whispered fiercely in the dream, and rapped softly on the glass with her 
knuckles. The glass felt cold to her touch; she could see the small, crescent-shaped marks her 
knuckles left in the frost. It was amazing how real some dreams could be.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">But it had to be a dream. It had to be because the car heard her. The words were no more 
than out of her mouth when the wipers suddenly started up, flicking wet snow off the 
windscreen in somehow contemptuous swipes. And then it - or she - drew smoothly away 
from the kerb and was gone up the street - 
With no one driving it. 
She was sure of that . . . as sure as one can be of anything in a dream. The passenger 
window had been dusted with snow but was not opaque with it. She had been able to see 
inside, and there was no one behind the wheel. So of course it had to be a dream. 
She drifted back to her bed (into which she had never brought a lover; like Arnie, she had 
never had a lover at all) thinking of a Christmas quite long ago - twelve, maybe even fourteen 
years ago. Surely she could have been no more than four at the time. She and her mother had 
been in one of the big. department stores in Boston, Filene's maybe. . . . 
She put her head down on her pillow and fell asleep (in her dream) with her eyes open, 
looking at the faint gleam of early light in the window, and then - in dreams anything could 
happen - she saw the Filene's toy department on the other side of the window: tinsel, glitter, 
lights. 
They were looking for something for Bruce, Mother and Dad's only nephew. Somewhere a 
department-store Santa Claus was ho-ho-ho-ing into a PA system, and the amplified sound 
was not jolly but somehow ominous, the laughter of a maniac who had come in the night not 
with presents but with a meat cleaver. 
She had held out her hand toward one of the displays, had pointed and told her mother that 
she wanted Santa Claus to bring her that. 
No, honey, Santa can't bring you that. That's a boy-toy. 
But I want it! 
Santa will bring you a nice doll, maybe even a Barbie - 
Want that - ! 
Only boy elves make those, Lee-Lee my love-love. For boys. The nice girl elves make nice 
dolls - 
I don't want a DOLL! I don't want a BARBIE! I . . . want . . . THAT! 
If you're going to throw a tantrum, I'll have to take you home, Leigh. I mean it, now. 
So she had submitted, and Christmas had brought her not only Malibu Barbie but also 
Malibu Ken, and she had enjoyed them (she supposed), but still she remembered the red 
Remco racing car on its green surface of painted hills, running without a cord along a painted 
road so perfect that there were even tiny metal guardrails - a road whose essential illusion 
was given away only by its pointless circularity. Ali, but it ran fast, that car, and was it bright</p>
      <p class="calibre3">red magic in her eye and her mind? It was. And the car's essential illusion was also magic. 
That illusion was somehow so captivating that it stole her heart. The illusion, of course, was 
that the car was driving itself. She knew that a store employee was really controlling it from a 
booth to the right, pushing buttons on a square wireless device. Her mother told her that was 
how it was happening, and so it must be so, but her eyes denied it, 
Her heart denied it. 
She stood fascinated, her small gloved hands on the rail of the display area, watching it race 
around and around, moving fast, driving itself, until her mother pulled her gently away. 
And over everything, seeming to cause the very tinsel strung along the ceiling to vibrate, 
the ominous laughter of the department-store Santa. 
* * * * * 
Leigh slept more deeply, dreams and memories slowly fading, and outside daylight came 
creeping in like cold milk, illuminating a street that was Sunday-morning empty and Sunday-
morning silent. The season's first fall of snow was unmarred except for the tyre tracks that 
swerved to the kerb in front of the Cabot house and then moved smoothly away again, toward 
the intersection at the end of this suburban block. 
She didn't rise until nearly ten o'clock (her mother, who didn't believe in slugabeds, finally 
called for her to come down and have breakfast before lunch), and by then the day had 
already warmed up to nearly sixty degrees - in western Pennsylvania, early November is apt 
to be every bit as capricious as early April. So by ten o'clock the snow had melted. And the 
tracks were gone.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">25   BUDDY VISITS THE                                                                
AIRPORT 
 
We shut 'em up and then we shut 'em down. 
                                     - Bruce Springsteen 
 
One night some ten days later, as cardboard turkeys and construction-paper cornucopias 
were beginning to appear in grammar school windows, a blue Camaro, so radically jacked in 
the back that its nose seemed almost to scrape the road, slid into the long-term parking lane at 
the airport. 
Sandy Galton looked out from his glass booth nervously. From the driver's side of the Ford 
the happy smiling face of Buddy Repperton tilted up toward him. Buddy's face was scrubbed 
with a week-old beard and his eyes held a maniacal glitter that was more cocaine than 
Thanksgiving cheer - he and the boys had scored a pretty good gram that evening. All in all, 
Buddy looked quite a bit like a depraved Clint Eastwood. 
'How are they hanging, Sandy?' Buddy asked. 
Dutiful laughter from the Camaro greeted this sally. Don Vandenberg, Moochie Welch, and 
Richie Trelawney were with Buddy, and between the gram of coke and the six bottles of 
Texas Driver Buddy had procured for the occasion, they were feeling pretty much reet and 
compleet. They had come to do a little dirty boogie on Arnie Cunningham's Plymouth. 
'Listen, if you guys get caught, I'm gonna lose my job,' Sandy said nervously. He was the 
only one cold sober, and be was regretting ever having mentioned that Cunningham was 
parking his heap here. The thought that he might go to jail as well had fortunately not 
occurred to him. 
'If you or any of your Mission Imfuckingpossible force are caught, the Secretary will 
disavow you ever fuckin lived,' Moochie said from the back seat, and there was more 
laughter. 
Sandy looked around for other cars - witnesses - but there were no planes due for more than 
an hour and the parking lot was as deserted as the mountains of the moon. The weather had 
turned very cold, and a wind as keen as a fresh razor-blade whined across the runways and 
taxi-ways and hooted miserably between the ranks of empty cars. Above and to his left, the 
Apco sign banged restlessly back and forth. 
'You can laugh, you retard,' Sandy said. 'I never saw you, that's all. If you get caught, I'll 
say I was takin a crap.'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'Jesus, what a baby,' Buddy said. He looked sorrowful. 'I never thought you were such a 
baby, Sandy. Honest.' 
'Arf! Arf!' Richie barked, and there was more laughter. 'Roll over and play dead for Daddy 
Warbucks, Sandy!' 
Sandy flushed. 'I don't care,' he said. 'Just be careful.' 
'We will, man,' Buddy said sincerely. He had saved back a seventh bottle of Texas Driver 
and a pretty decent toot of nose-candy. Now he handed both up to Sandy. 'Here. Enjoy 
yourself.' 
Sandy grinned in spite of himself. 'Okay,' he said, and added, just so they'd know he was no 
sad sack: 'Do a good job.' 
Buddy's smile hardened, became metallic. The light went out of his eyes; they became dull 
and dead and frightening. 'Oh, we will,' he said. 'We will.' 
The Camaro drifted into the parking lot. For a while Sandy could follow its progress toward 
the back by the moving tail-lights, and then Buddy doused them. The sound of the motor, 
burbling through twin glasspack mufflers, came back for a few moments on the wind, and 
then that sound was gone, too. 
Sandy dumped the coke out on the counter by his portable TV and tooted it with a rolled-up 
dollar bill. Then he got into the Texas Driver. He knew that being discovered drunk on the 
job would also get him canned, but he didn't much care. Being drunk was better than being 
cat-jumpy and always staring around for one of the two grey Airport Security cars. 
The wind was blowing toward him, and he could hear too much, he could hear. 
A tinkle of breaking glass, muffled laughter, a loud metallic thonk. 
More breaking glass. 
A pause. 
Low voices drifting to him on the cold wind. He was unable to pick up the individual 
words; they were distorted. 
Suddenly there was a perfect fusillade of blows; Sandy winced at the sound. More breaking 
glass in the dark, and a tinkle of metal falling on the pavement - chrome or something, he 
supposed. He found himself wishing Buddy had brought more coke. Coke was sort of cheery 
stuff, and he sure could use some cheering up right about now. It sounded as if some pretty 
bad stuff was going on down at the far end of that parking lot. 
And then a louder voice, urgent and commanding, Buddy's for sure: 
'Do it there!' 
A mutter of protest.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Buddy again: 'Never mind that! On the dashboard, I said!' 
Another mutter. 
Buddy: “I don't give a shit!' 
And for some reason this produced a stifle of laughter. 
Sweaty now in spite of the knifing cold, Sandy suddenly slid his glass window shut and 
snapped on the TV. He drank deeply, grimacing at the heavy taste of the mixed fruit juice and 
cheap wine. He didn't care for it, but Texas Driver was what they all drank when they weren't 
drinking Iron City beer, and what was he supposed to do? Make out he was better than them, 
or something? That would get him fried, sooner or later. Buddy didn't like wimps. 
He drank, and began to feel a little better or at least a little drunker. When one of the 
Airport Security cars did pass, he hardly even flinched. The cop raised a hand to Sandy. 
Sandy raised a hand right back, just as cool as you could want. 
About fifteen minutes after it had cruised toward the back of the lot, the blue Camaro 
reappeared, this time in the exit lane. Buddy sat cool and relaxed behind the wheel, a three-
quarters-empty bottle of Driver propped in his crotch. He was smiling, and Sandy noted 
uneasily how bloodshot and weird his eyes looked. That wasn't just wine, and it wasn't just 
coke, either. Buddy Repperton was no one to fuck with; Cunningham would find that out, if 
nothing else. 
'All taken care of, my good man” Buddy said. 
'Good,' Sandy said, and tried a smile. It felt a little sick. He had no feelings about 
Cunningham one way or another, and he was not a particularly imaginative person, but he 
could make a good guess about how Cunningham was going to feel when he saw what had 
come of all his careful work restoring that red and white Plymouth. Still, it was Buddy's 
business, not his. 
'Good,' he said again. 
'Keep your jock on, man,' Richie said, and giggled. 
'Sure,' Sandy said. He was glad they were going. Maybe he wouldn't hang around 
Vandenberg's Happy Gas so much after this. Maybe after this he didn't want to. This was 
heavy shit. Too heavy, maybe. And maybe he would pick up a couple of night courses, too. 
He'd have to give this job up, but maybe that wouldn't be so bad, either - it was a pretty dull 
fucking job. 
Buddy was still looking at him, smiling that hard, gonzo smile, and Sandy took a big drink 
of Texas Driver. He nearly gagged. For an instant he had an image of puking down into 
Buddy's upturned face, and his unease became terror.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'If the cops get in on it,' Buddy said, 'you don't know nothing, you didn't see nothing. Like 
you said, you had to go in and take a crap around nine-thirty.' 
'Sure, Buddy.' 
'We all wore our wittle mittens. We didn't leave any prints.' 
'Sure.' 
'Stay cool, Sandy, Buddy said softly. 
'Yeah, okay.' 
The Camaro began to roll again. Sandy raised the gate with the manual button. The car 
headed toward the airport exit road at a sedate pace. 
Someone called 'Arf! Arf!' The sound drifted back to Sandy against the wind. 
Troubled, he sat down to watch TV. 
Shortly before the rush of customers who had come in on the ten-forty from Cleveland 
began to arrive, he poured the rest of the Driver out of the window and onto the ground. He 
didn't want it anymore.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">26   CHRISTINE LAID LOW 
 
Transfusion, transfusion,

Pass the blood to me, Bud. 
                         - 'Nervous' Norvus 
 
The next day Arnie and Leigh rode out to the airport together after school to pick up 
Christine. They were planning on a trip to Pittsburgh to do some early Christmas shopping, 
and they were looking forward to doing it together - it seemed somehow terribly adult. 
Arnie was in a fine mood on the bus, making up fanciful little vignettes about their fellow 
passengers and making her laugh in spite of her period, which was usually depressing and 
almost always painful. The fat lady in the man's workshoes was a lapsed nun, he said. The 
kid in the cowboy hat was a hustler. And on and on. She got into the spirit of the thing but 
was not as good at it as he. It was amazing, the way he had come out of his shell . . . the way 
he had bloomed. That was really the only word for it. She felt the smug, pleased satisfaction 
of a prospector who has suspected the presence of gold by certain signs and has been proved 
correct. She loved him, and she had been right to love him. 
They got off the bus at the terminal stop together and walked across the access road to the 
parking lot hand in hand. 
'This isn't bad,' Leigh said. It was the first time she had come out with him to pick up 
Christine. 'Twenty-five minutes from school.' 
'Yeah, it's okay,' Arnie said. "It keeps peace in the family, that's the important thing. I'm 
telling you, when my mom got home that night and saw Christine in the driveway, she went 
totally bullshit.' 
Leigh laughed, and the wind flipped her hair out behind her. The temperature had 
moderated from last night's bitter mid-teens, but it was still chilly. She was glad. Without a 
certain chill in the air, it didn't feel like Christmas shopping. Bad enough the decorations in 
Pittsburgh wouldn't be up yet. But it wasn't bad; it was good. And suddenly she was glad 
about everything, most of all glad to be alive. And in love. 
She had thought about it, the way she loved him. She had had crushes before, and once, in 
Massachusetts, she had thought she might be in love, but about this boy there was simply no 
question. He troubled her sometimes - his interest in the car seemed almost obsessive - but 
even her occasional unease played a part in her feelings, which were richer than anything she 
had ever known. And part of it, she admitted to herself, was of course selfish - she had, in 
weeks only, begun to make him over . . . to complete him.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">They cut between the cars, headed for the thirty-day section of the parking lot. Overhead, a 
USAir jet was coming in on its final approach, the thunder of its engines rolling away in great 
flat waves of sound. Arnie was saying something, but the plane obliterated his voice 
altogether after the first few words - something about Thanksgiving dinner - and she turned to 
look at his face, secretly amused by his silently moving mouth, 
Then, quite suddenly, his mouth stopped moving. He stopped walking, His eyes opened 
wider . . . and then seemed to bulge. His mouth began to twist, and the hand holding Leigh's 
suddenly clamped down ruthlessly, grinding her fingerbones painfully together. 
'Arnie - ' 
The jet-roar was fading, but he seemed not to have heard. His hand clamped tighter. His 
mouth had slammed shut now, and it was knotted into an awful grimace of surprise and 
terror. She thought, He's having a heart attack . . . stroke . . . something. 
'Arnie, what's wrong?' she cried. 'Arnie . . . ooowwwhoww, that hurts!' 
For one unbearable moment the pressure on the hand he had been holding so lightly and 
lovingly just before increased until it seemed that the bones would actually splinter and 
break. The high colour in his cheeks was gone, and his skin was as leaden as a slate 
headstone. 
He said one word - 'Christine!' - and suddenly let go of her. He ran, thumping his leg 
against the bumper of a Cadillac, spinning away, almost falling, catching himself, and 
running forward again. 
She realized at last it was something about the car - the ear, the car, always it was the 
goddam car - and a bitter anger rose in her that was both total and despairing. For the first 
time she wondered if it would be possible to love him; if Arnie would allow it. 
Her anger was quenched the instant she really looked . . . and saw. 
* * * * * 
Arnie ran to what remained of his car, hands out, and stopped so abruptly in front of it that 
the gesture seemed almost to be a horrified warding-off; the classic movie pose of the hit-
and-run victim an instant before the lethal collision. 
He stood that way for a moment, as if to stop the car, or the whole world. Then he lowered 
his arms. His adam's apple lurched up and down twice as he struggled to swallow something 
back - a moan, a cry - and then his throat seemed to lock solid, every muscle standing out, 
each cord standing out, even the blood-vessels standing out in perfect relief. It was the throat 
of a man trying to lift a piano. 
Leigh walked slowly toward him. Her hand still throbbed, and tomorrow it would be 
swollen and virtually useless, but for now she had forgotten it. Her heart went out to him and 
seemed to find him; she felt his sorrow and shared it or it seemed to her that she did. It was</p>
      <p class="calibre3">only later that she realized how much Arnie shut her out that day - how much of his suffering 
he elected to do alone, and how much of his hate he hid away. 
'Arnie, who did it?' she asked, her voice breaking with grief for him. No, she had not liked 
the car, but to see it reduced to this made her understand fully what Arnie's commitment had 
been, and she could hate it no longer - or so she thought. 
Arnie made no answer. He stood looking at Christine, his eyes burning, his head slightly 
down. 
The windscreen had been smashed through in two places; handfuls of safety glass 
fragments were strewn across the slashed seat covers like trumpery diamonds. Half of the 
front bumper had been pried off and now dragged on the pavement, near a snarl of black 
wires like octopus tentacles. Three of the four side windows had also been broken. Holes had 
been punched through the sides of the body at waist-level in ragged, wavering lines. It looked 
as if some sharp, heavy instrument - maybe the pry-end of a tyre iron - had been used. The 
passenger door hung open, and she saw that all the dashboard glass had been broken. Tufts 
and wads of stuffing were everywhere. The speedometer needle lay on the driver's side 
floormat. 
Arnie walked slowly around his car, noting all of this. Leigh spoke to him twice. He didn't 
answer either time. Now the leaden colour of his face was broken by two hectic, burning 
spots of flush riding high up on his cheekbones. He picked up the octopus-thing that a been 
lying on the pavement and she saw it was a distributor cap - her father had pointed that out to 
her once when he had been tinkering with their car. 
He looked at it for a moment, as if examining an exotic zoological specimen, and then 
threw it down. Broken glass gritted under their heels. She spoke to him again. He didn't 
answer, and now, as well as a terrible pity for him, she began to feel afraid, too. She told 
Dennis Guilder later that it seemed - at least at the time - perfectly possible that he might 
have lost his mind. 
He booted a piece of chrome trim out of his way. It struck the cyclone fence at the back of 
the lot with a little tinkling sound. The tail-lights had been smashed, more trumpery gems, 
this time rubies, this time on the pavement instead of the seat. 
'Arnie - ' she tried again. 
He stopped. He was looking in through the hole in the driver's side window. A terrible low 
sound began to come from his chest, a jungle sound. She looked over his shoulder, saw, and 
suddenly felt a crazy need to laugh and scream and faint all at the same time. On the 
dashboard . . . she hadn't noticed at first; in the midst of the general destruction she hadn't 
noticed what was on the dashboard. And she wondered, with vomit suddenly rising in her 
throat, who could be so low, so completely low, as to do such a thing, to . . . 
'Shitters!' Arnie cried, and his voice was not his own. It was high and shrill and cracked 
with fury.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Leigh turned around and threw up, holding blindly onto the car next to Christine, seeing 
small white dots in front of her eyes that expanded like puffed rice. Dimly she thought of the 
county fair - every year they'd haul an old junk car up onto a plank platform and lean a 
sledgehammer against it and you got three swings for a quarter. The idea was to demolish the 
car. But not . . . not to . . . 
'You goddam shitters!' Arnie screamed. 'I'll get you! I'll get you if it's the last thing I do! If 
it's the last motherfucking thing I ever do!' 
Leigh threw up again and for one terrible moment found herself wishing that she had never 
ever met Arnie Cunningham.</p>

And a supercharger up the side. 
- The Medallions 
 
He let himself into the house that night at quarter of twelve. The clothes he had been 
wearing with the shopping trip to Pittsburgh in mind were grease- and sweat-stained. His 
hands were more deeply grimed, and a shallow cut corkscrewed across the back of the left 
like a brand. His face looked haggard and stunned. There were dark circles under his eyes. 
His mother sat at the table, a game of solitaire laid out in front of her. She had been waiting 
for him to come home and dreading it deeply at the same time. Leigh had called and told her 
what had happened. The girl, who had impressed Regina as being quite a nice girl (if perhaps 
not quite good enough for her son), sounded as if she had been crying. 
Regina, alarmed, had hung up as quickly as she could and had dialled Darnell's Garage. 
Leigh had told her Arnie had called for a tow-truck from there and bad ridden in with the 
driver. He had put her in a taxi, over her protests. The phone had rung twice and then a 
wheezy yet gravelly voice had said, 'Yuh. Darnell's.' 
She had hung up, realizing it would be a mistake to talk to him there - and it looked as if 
she and Mike had already made enough mistakes about Arnie and his car. She would wait 
until he came home. Say what she had to say looking him in the face . 
She said it now. 'Arnie, I'm sorry.' 
It would have been better if Mike could be here, too. But he was in Kansas City, attending a 
symposium on trade and the beginnings of free enterprise in the Middle Ages. He wouldn't be 
back until Sunday, unless this brought him home early. She thought it might. She realized - 
not without some rue - that she might just be awakening to the full seriousness of this 
situation. 
'Sorry,' Arnie echoed in a flat, accentless voice. 
'Yes, I - that is, we - ' She couldn't go on. There was something terrible in the deadwood of 
his expression. His eyes were blanks. She could only look at him and shake her head, her 
eyes brimming, the hateful taste of tears in her nose and throat. She hated to cry. Strong-
willed, one of two girls in a Catholic family that consisted of, her blue-collar construction-</p>
      <p class="calibre3">worker father, her washed-out mother, and seven brothers, hellbent on college in spite of her 
father's belief that the only things girls learned there were how to stop being virgins and how 
to throw over the church, she had shed her fair share of tears and more. And if her own 
family thought she was hard sometimes, it was because they didn't understand that when you 
went through hell you came out baked by the fire. And when you had to burn to have your 
own way, you always wanted to have it. 
'You know something?' Arnie asked. 
She shook her head, still feeling the hot, slithery burn of the tears tinder her lids. 
'You'd make me laugh, if I wasn't so tired I could hardly stand up. You could have been out 
there swinging the tyre irons and the hammers along with the guys that did it. You're 
probably happier about it than they are.' 
'Arnie, that's not fair!' 
'It is fair!' he roared at her, his eyes suddenly blazing with a horrible fire. For the first time 
in her life she was afraid of her son. 'Your idea to get it out of the driveway! His idea to put it 
in the airport lot! Who do you think is to blame here? Just who do you think? Do you think it 
would have happened if it had been here? Huh?' 
He took a step toward her, fists clenched at his sides, and she had all she could do to keep 
from flinching backward. 
'Arnie, can't we even talk about this?' she asked. 'Like two rational human beings?' 
'One of them took a shit on the dashboard of my car,' he said coldly. 'How's that for 
rational, Mom?' 
She had honestly believed she had the tears under control, but this news - news of such a 
stupid, irrational fury - brought them back. She cried. She cried in grief for what her son had 
seen. She lowered her head and cried in bewilderment and pain and fear. 
All her life as a mother she had felt secretly superior to the women around her who had 
children older than Arnie. When he was one, those other mothers had shaken their heads 
dolefully and told her to wait until he was five - that was when the trouble started, that was 
when they were old enough to say 'shit' in front of their grandmothers and play with matches 
when left alone. But Arnold, as good as gold at one, had still been as good as gold at five. 
Then the other mothers had rolled their eyes and said wait until he's ten; and then it had been 
fifteen, that was when it really got sticky, what with the dope and the rock concerts and girls 
that would do anything and - God forbid - stealing hubcaps and those . . . well, diseases. 
And through it all she had continued to smile inside because it was all working out 
according to plan, it was all working out the way she felt her own childhood should have. Her 
son had warm, supportive parents who cared about him, who would give him anything 
(within reason), who would gladly send him to the college of his choice (as long as it was a 
good one), thereby finishing the game/ business/vocation of Parenting with a flourish. If you</p>
      <p class="calibre3">had suggested that Arnie had few friends and was often bullyragged by the others, she would 
have starchily pointed out that she had gone to a parochial school in a tough neighbourhood 
where girls' cotton panties were sometimes torn off for a joke and then set on fire with Zippo 
lighters engraved with the crucified body Jesus. And if you had suggested that her own 
attitudes toward child-rearing differed only in terms of material goals from the attitudes of 
her hated father, she would have been furious and pointed out her good son as her final 
vindication. 
But now her good son stood before her, pale, exhausted, and greased to the elbows, 
seeming to thrum with the same sort of barely chained anger that had been his grandfather's 
trademark, even looking like him. Everything seemed to have fallen into a shambles. 
'Arnie, we'll talk about what's to be done in the morning,' she said, trying to pull herself 
together and beat back the tears. 'We'll talk about it in the morning.' 
'Not unless you get up real early,' he said, seeming to lose interest. 'I'm going upstairs to 
catch about four hours, and then I'm going down to the garage again.' 
'What for?' 
He uttered a crazy laugh and flapped his arms under the kitchen's fluorescent bars as if he 
would fly. 'What do you think for? I got a lot of work to do! More work than you'd believe!' 
'No, you have school tomorrow . . . I . . . I forbid it, Arnie, I absolutely - ' 
He turned to look at her, study her, and she flinched again. This was like some grinding 
nightmare that was just going to go on and on. 
'I'll get to school,' he said. 'I'll take some fresh clothes in a pack and I'll even shower so I 
don't smell offensive to anyone in home room. Then, after school's out, I'll go back down to 
Darnell's. There's a lot of work to be done, but I can do it . . . I know I can . . . it's going to eat 
up a lot of my savings, though. Plus, I'll have to keep on top of the stuff I'm doing for Will.' 
'Your homework . . . your studies" 
'Oh. Those.' He smiled the dead, mechanical smile of a clockwork figure. 'They'll suffer, of 
course, Can't kid you about that. I can't promise you a ninety-three average anymore, either. 
But I'll get by. I can make C's. Maybe some B's.' 
'No! You've got college to think about!' 
He came back to the table, limping again, quite badly. He planted his hands on the table 
before her and leaned slowly down. She thought: A stranger . . . my son is a stranger to me. 
Is this really my fault? Is it? Because I only wanted what was best for him? Can that be? 
Please, God, make this a nightmare I'll wake up from with tears on my cheeks because it was 
so real.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'Right now,' he said softly, holding her gaze, 'the only things I care about are Christine and 
Leigh and staying on the good side of Will Darnell so I can get her fixed up as good as new. I 
don't give a shit about college. And if you don't get off my case, I'll drop out of high school. 
That ought to shut you up if nothing else will.' 
'You can't,' she said, meeting his gaze. 'You understand that, Arnold. Maybe I deserve your 
. . . your cruelty . . . but I'll fight this self-destructive streak of yours with everything I have. 
So don't you talk about dropping out of school.' 
'But I'll really do it,' he answered. 'I don't want you to even kid yourself into thinking I 
won't. I'll be eighteen in February, and I'll do it on my own then if you don't stay out of this 
from now on. Do you understand me?' 
'Go to bed,' she said tearfully. 'Go to bed, you're breaking my heart.' 
'Am I?' Shockingly, he laughed, 'Hurts, doesn't it? I know.' 
He left then, walking slowly, the limp pulling his body slightly to the left. Shortly she heard 
the heavy, tired clump of his shoes on the stairs - also a sound terribly reminiscent of her 
childhood, when she had thought to herself, The ogre's going to bed. 
She burst into a fresh spasm of weeping, got up clumsily, and went out the back door to do 
her crying in private. She held herself - thin comfort, but better than none - and looked up at a 
horned moon that was quadrupled through the film of her tears. Everything had changed, and 
it had happened with the speed of a cyclone. Her son hated her; she had seen it in his face - it 
wasn't a tantrum, a temporary pique, a passing squall of adolescence. He hated her, and this 
wasn't the way it was supposed to go with her good boy, not at all. 
Not at all. 
She stood on the stoop and cried until the tears began to run their course and the sobs 
became occasional hatchings and gasps. The cold gnawed her bare ankles above her mules 
and bit more bluntly through her housecoat. She went inside and upstairs. She stood outside 
Arnie's room indecisively for almost a minute before going in. 
He had fallen asleep on the coverlet of his bed. His pants were still on. He seemed more 
unconscious than asleep, and his face looked horribly old. A trick of the light, coming from 
the hall and falling into the room from over her shoulder, made it seem for a moment to her 
that his hair was thinning, that his sleep-gaping mouth was without teeth. A small squeal of 
horror strained itself through the hand clapped to her mouth and she hurried toward him. 
Her shadow, which had been on the bed, moved with her and she saw it was only Arnie, the 
impression of age no more than the light and her own exhausted confusion, 
She looked at his clock-radio and saw that it was set for 4:30 AM. She thought of turning 
the alarm off; she even stretched her hand out to do it. Ultimately she found she couldn't.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Instead she went down to her bedroom, sat down at the phone table, and picked up the 
handset. She held it for a moment, debating. If she called Mike in the middle of the night, he 
would think that . . . 
That something terrible had happened? 
She giggled. Well, hadn't it? It surely had. And it was still happening. 
She dialled the number of the Ramada Inn in Kansas City where her husband was staying, 
vaguely aware that she was, for the first time since she had left the grim and grimy three-
storey house in Rocksburg for college twenty-seven years before, calling for help.</p>

She got through most of the story okay sitting in one of the two visitors' chairs with her 
knees pressed firmly together and her ankles crossed, neatly dressed in a multicoloured wool 
sweater and a brown corduroy skirt. It was not until the end that she began to cry, and she 
couldn't find a handkerchief. Dennis Guilder handed her the box of tissues from the table 
beside the bed. 
'Take it easy, Leigh,' he said. 
'I cuh-cuh-can't! He hasn't been to see me and in school be just seems so tired . . . and you 
s-said he hasn't been here - ' 
'He'll come if he needs me,' Dennis said. 
'You're full of muh-macho b-bull-sh-sh-shit!' she said, and then looked comically stunned at 
what she had said. The tears had cut tracks in the light makeup she was wearing. She and 
Dennis looked at each other for a moment, and then they laughed. But it was brief laughter, 
and not really that good. 
'Has Motormouth seen him?' Dennis asked. 
'Who?' 
'Motormouth. That's what Lenny Barongg calls Mr Vickers. The guidance counsellor.' 
'Oh! Yes. I think he has. He was called to the guidance office the day before yesterday 
Monday. But he didn't say anything. And I didn't dare ask him anything. He won't talk. He's 
gotten so strange.' 
Dennis nodded. Although he didn't think Leigh realized it - she was deep in her own trouble 
and confusion - he felt a sense of impotence and a deepening fear for Arnie. From the reports 
that had filtered into his room over the last few days, Arnie sounded on the verge of a 
nervous breakdown; Leigh's report was only the most recent and the most graphic. He had 
never wanted to be out as badly as he did now. Of course, he could call Vickers and ask him</p>
      <p class="calibre3">if there I was anything he could do. And he could call Arnie . . . except, from what Leigh had 
said, Arnie was now always at school, at Darnell's, or sleeping. His father had come home 
early from some sort of convention and there had been another fight, Leigh had told him. 
Although Arnie had not come right out and said so, Leigh told Dennis she believed that he 
had come very close to simply leaving home. 
Dennis didn't want to talk to Arnie at Darnell's. 
'What can I do?' she asked him. 'What would you do, in my place?' 
'Wait,' Dennis said. 'I don't know what else you can do.' 
'But that's hardest,' she answered in a voice so low it was almost inaudible. Her hands were 
clenching and unclenching on the Kleenex, shredding it, dotting her brown skirt with 
speckles of lint. 'My folks want me to stop seeing him - to drop him. They're afraid. . . that 
Repperton and those other boys will do something else.' 
'You're, pretty sure it was Buddy and his friends, huh?' 
'Yes. Everybody is. Mr Cunningham called the police even though Arnie told him not to. 
He said he'd settle the score in his own way, and that scared them both. It scares me, too, The 
police picked up Buddy Repperton, and one of his friends, the one they call Moochie . . . do 
you know who I mean?' 
'Yes.' 
'And the boy who works nights at the airport parking lot, they picked him up, too. Galton, 
his name is - ' 
'Sandy.' 
'They thought he must have been in on it, that maybe he let them in.' 
'He runs with them, all right,' Dennis said, 'but he's not quite as degenerate as the rest of 
them. I'll say this, Leigh - if Arnie didn't talk to someone sure did.' 
'First Mrs Cunningham and then his father. I don't think either of them knew the other one 
had talked to me. They're . . . ' 
'Upset,' Dennis suggested. 
She shook her head. 'It's more than that,' she said. 'They both look like they were just . . . 
just mugged, or something. I can't really feel sorry for her - all she wants is her own way, I 
think - but I could cry for Mr Cunningham. He just seems so . . . so . . . ' She trailed off and 
began again. 'When I got there yesterday afternoon after school, Mrs Cunningham - she asked 
me to call her Regina, but I just can't seem to do it - ' 
Dennis grinned 
'Can you do it?' Leigh asked.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'Well, yeah - but I've had a lot more practice.' 
She smiled, the first good one of her visit. 'Maybe that would make a difference. Anyway, 
when I went over, she was there but Mr Cunningham was still at school . . . the University, I 
mean.' 
'Yeah.' 
'She took the whole week off - what there is of it. She said couldn't go back, even for the 
three days before Thanksgiving.' 
'How does she look?' 
'She looks shattered,' Leigh said, and reached for a fresh Kleenex. She began shredding the 
edges. 'She looks ten years older than when I first met her a month ago.' 
'And him? Michael?' 
'Older but tougher,' Leigh said hesitantly.' As if this had somehow . . . somehow gotten him 
into gear. 
Dennis was silent. He had known Michael Cunningham for thirteen years and had never 
seen him in gear, so he wouldn't know. Regina had always been the one in gear; Michael 
trailed along in her wake and made the drinks at the parties (mostly faculty parties) the 
Cunninghams hosted. He played his recorder, he looked melancholy . . . but by no stretch of 
the imagination could Dennis say he had ever seen the man 'in gear'. 
The final triumph, Dennis's father had said once, standing at the window and watching 
Regina lead Arnie by the hand down the Guilders' walk to where Michael waited behind the 
wheel of the car. Arnie and Dennis had been perhaps seven then. Momism supreme. I wonder 
if she'll make the poor slob wait in the car when Arnie gets married. Or maybe she can - 
Dennis's mother had frowned at her husband and shushed him by cutting her eyes at Dennis 
in a little-pitchers-have-big-ears gesture. He never forgot the gesture or what his father had 
said - at seven he hadn't understood all of it, but even at seven he knew perfectly well what a 
'poor slob' was. And even at seven he vaguely understood why his father might think Michael 
Cunningham was one. He had felt sad for, Michael Cunningham . . . and that feeling had 
held, off and on, right up to the present. 
'He came in around the time she was finishing her story, Leigh went on. 'They asked me to 
stay for supper - Arnie has been eating down at Darnell's - but I told them I really had to get 
back. So Mr Cunningham offered me a ride, and I got his side on the way home.' 
'Are they on different sides?' 
'Not exactly, but . . . Mr Cunningham was the one who went to see the police, for instance. 
Arnie didn't want to, and Mrs Cunningham - Regina - couldn't bring herself to do it.' 
Dennis asked cautiously, 'He's really trying to put Humpty back together again, huh?'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'Yes,' she whispered, and then burst out shrilly: 'But that's not all! He's in deep with that 
guy Darnell, I know he is! Yesterday in period three study hall he told me he was going to 
drop a new front end into her - into his car - this afternoon and this evening, and I said won't 
that be awfully expensive Arnie, and he said not to worry about it because his credit was 
good - ' 
'Slow down.' 
She was crying again. 'His credit was good because he and someone named Jimmy Sykes 
were going to do some errands for Will Friday and Saturday. That's what he said. And . . . I 
don't think the errands he does for that sonofabitch are legal!' 
'What did he tell the police when they came to ask about Christine?' 
'He told them about finding it . . . that way. They asked him if he had any ideas who might 
have done it, and Arnie said no. They asked him if it wasn't true that he had gotten into a 
fight with Buddy Repperton, that Repperton had pulled a knife and had been expelled for it. 
Arnie said that Repperton had knocked his bag lunch out of his hand and stepped on it, then 
Mr Casey came over from the shop and broke it up. They asked him if Repperton hadn't said 
he would get him for it, and Arnie said he might have said something like that, but talk was 
cheap.' 
Dennis was silent, looking out his window at a dull November sky, considering this. He 
found it ominous. If Leigh had the interview with the police right, then Arnie hadn't told a 
single lie . . . but he had edited things to make what had happened in the smoking area sound 
like your ordinary pushy-pushy. 
Dennis found that extremely ominous. 
'Do you know what Arnie might be doing for that man Darnell?' Leigh asked. 
'No,' Dennis answered, but he had some ideas. A little internal tape recorder started up, and 
he heard his father saying, I've heard a few things . . . stolen cars. . . cigarettes and booze . . . 
contraband like fireworks. . . . He's been lucky for a long time, Dennis. 
He looked at Leigh's face, too pale, her makeup cut open by her tears. She was hanging on, 
hanging onto Arnie as best she could. Maybe she was learning something about being tough 
that she wouldn't have learned otherwise, with her looks, for another ten years. But that didn't 
make it any easier, and it didn't necessarily make it right. It occurred to him suddenly, almost 
randomly, that he had first noticed the improvement in Arnie's face more than a month before 
Arnie and Leigh clicked . . . but after Arnie and Christine had clicked. 
'I'll talk to him,' he promised. 
'Good,' she said. She stood up. 'I - I don't want things to be like they were before, Dennis. I 
know that nothing ever is. But I still love him, and . . . and I just wish you'd tell him that.' 
'Yeah, okay.'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">They were both embarrassed, and neither of them could say anything for a long, long 
moment. Dennis was thinking that this would be the point, in a c &amp; w song, where the Best 
Friend steps in. And a sneaking, mean (and randy) part of him wouldn't be averse to that. Not 
at all. He was still powerfully attracted to her, more attracted than he had been to any girl in a 
long time. Maybe ever. Let Arnie run bottle-rockets and cherry-bombs over to Burlington and 
fuck around with his car. He and Leigh could get to know each other better in the meantime. 
A little aid and comfort. You know how it is. 
And he had a feeling at just that awkward moment, after her profession of love for Arnie, 
that he could do it; she was vulnerable. She was maybe learning how to be tough, but it's not 
a school anyone goes to willingly. He could say something - the right something, maybe only 
Come here - and she would come, sit on the edge of the bed, they would talk some more, 
maybe about pleasanter things, and maybe he would kiss her. Her mouth was lovely and full, 
sensual, made to kiss and be kissed. Once for comfort. Twice out of friendship. And three 
times pays for all. Yes, he felt with an instinct that had so far been quite reliable that it could 
be done. 
But he didn't say any of the things that could have started those things happening, and 
neither did Leigh. Arnie was between them, and almost surely always would be. Arnie and 
his lady. If it hadn't been so ludicrously ghastly, he could have laughed. 
'When are they letting you out?' she asked. 
'On an unsuspecting public?' he asked, and began to giggle. After a moment she joined him 
in his laughter 'Yes, something like that,' Leigh said, and then snickered again. 'Sorry.' 
'Don't be,' Dennis said. 'People have been laughing at me all my life. I'm used to it. They 
say I'm stuck here until January, but I'm going to fool them. I'm going home for Christmas. 
I'm working my buns off down in the torture chamber.' 
'Torture chamber?' 
'Physical therapy. My back's looking good. The other bones are knitting busily - the itch is 
terrible sometimes. I'm gobbling rosehips by the bushel basket. Dr Arroway says that's 
nothing but a folk-tale, but Coach Puffer swears by them, and he checks the bottle every time 
he comes to visit.' 
'Does he come often? The Coach?' 
'Yeah, he does. Now he's got me half-believing that stuff about rosehips making your 
broken bones knit faster.' Dennis paused. 'Of course, I'm not going to be playing any more 
football, not ever. I'm going to be on crutches for a while, and then, with luck, I'll graduate to 
a cane. Cheerful old Dr Arroway tells me I'm going to limp for maybe a couple of years. Or 
maybe I'll always limp.'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'I'm so sorry,' she said in a low voice. 'I'm sorry it had to happen to a nice guy like you, 
Dennis, but part of it's selfish. I just wonder if all the rest of this, all this horrible stuff with 
Arnie, if it would have happened if you'd been up and around.' 
'That's right,' Dennis said, rolling his eyes dramatically, 'blame it on me.' 
But she didn't smile. 'I've started to worry about his sanity, did you know that? That's the 
one thing I haven't told my folks or his folks. But I think his mother . . . that she might . . . I 
don't know what he said to her that night, after we found the car all smashed up, but . . . I 
think they must have really put their claws into each other.' 
Dennis nodded. 
'But it's all so . . . so mad! His parents offered to buy him a good used car to replace 
Christine, and he said no. Then Mr Cunningham told me on the ride home that he offered to 
buy Arnie a new car . . . to cash in some bonds he's held ever since 1955. Arnie said no, he 
couldn't just take a present like that. And Mr Cunningham said he could understand that, and 
it didn't have to be a present, that Arnie could pay him back, that he'd even take interest if that 
was what Arnie wanted. . . . Dennis, do you see what I'm saying?' 
'Yeah,' Dennis said. 'It can't be just any car. It's got to be that car. Christine.' 
'But to me that seems obsessive. He's found one object and fixed on it. Isn't that what an 
obsession is? I'm scared, and sometimes I feel hateful . . . but it's not him I'm scared of. It's 
not him I hate. It's that frig - no, it's that fucking car. That bitch Christine.' 
High colour bloomed in her cheeks. Her eyes narrowed. The corners of her mouth turned 
down. Her face was suddenly no longer beautiful, not even pretty; the light on it was pitiless, 
changing it into something that was ugly but all the same striking, compelling. Dennis 
realized for the first time why they called it the monster, the green-eyed monster. 
I'll tell you what I wish would happen,' Leigh said. 'I wish somebody would take his 
precious fucking Christine out back some night by mistake, out where they put the junks from 
Philly Plains.' Her eyes sparkled venomously. 'And the next day I wish that crane with the big 
round magnet would come and pick it up and put it in the crusher and I wish someone would 
push the button and what would come out would be a little cube of metal about three by three 
by three. Then this would be over, wouldn't it?' 
Dennis didn't answer, and after a moment he could almost see the monster turn around and 
wrap its scaly tail around itself and steal out of her face. Her shoulders sagged. 
'Guess that sounds pretty horrible, doesn't it? Like saying I wish those hoods had finished 
the job.' 
'I understand how you feel.' 
'Do you?' she challenged.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Dennis thought of Arnie's look as he had pounded his fists on the dashboard. The kind of 
maniacal light that came into his eyes when he was around her. He thought of sitting behind 
the wheel in LeBay's garage, and the kind of vision that had come over him. 
Last of all, he thought of his dream: headlights bearing down on him in the high 
womanscream of burning rubber. 
'Yes,' he said. 'I think I do.' 
They looked at each other in the hospital room.</p>

Two-three hours passed us by,

I'm gone like a cooool breeze.

At the hospital they served Thanksgiving dinner in shifts from eleven in the morning until 
one in the afternoon. Dennis got his at quarter past twelve: three careful slices of white turkey 
breast, one careful ladleful of brown gravy, a scoop of instant mashed potatoes the exact size 
and shape of a baseball (lacking only the red stitches, he thought with sour amusement), a 
like scoop of frozen squash that was an arrogant fluorescent orange, and a small plastic 
container of cranberry jelly. For dessert there was ice cream. Resting on the corner of his tray 
was a small blue card. 
Wise to the ways of the hospital by now - once you have been treated for the first set of 
bedsores to crop up on your ass, Dennis had discovered, you're wiser to the ways of the 
hospital than you ever wanted to be - he asked the candy-striper who came to take away his 
tray what the yellow and red cards got for their Thanksgiving dinner. It turned out that the 
yellow cards got two pieces of turkey, no gravy, potato, no squash, and Jell-O for dessert. 
The red cards got one slice of white meat, pureed, and potato. Fed to them, in most cases. 
Dennis found it all pretty depressing. It was only too easy to imagine his mother bringing a 
great big crackling capon to the dining-room table around four in the afternoon, his father 
sharpening his carving knife, his sister, flushed with importance and excitement, a red velvet 
ribbon in her hair, pouring each of them a glass of good red wine. It was also easy to imagine 
the good smells, the laughter as they sat down. 
Easy to imagine . . . but probably a mistake. 
It was, in fact, the most depressing Thanksgiving of his life. He drifted off into an 
unaccustomed early afternoon nap (no Physical Therapy because of the holiday) and dreamed 
an unsettling dream in which several candy-stripers walked through the IC ward and slapped 
turkey decals onto the life-support machinery and IV drips. 
His mother, father, and sister had come over to visit for an hour in the morning, and for the 
first time he had sensed in Ellie an anxiousness to be gone. They had been invited over to the</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Callisons' for a light Thanksgiving brunch, and Lou Callison, one of the three Callison boys, 
was fourteen and 'cute'. Her racked-up brother had become boring. They hadn't discovered a 
rare and tragic form of cancer breeding in his bones. He wasn't going to be paralysed for the 
rest of his life. There was no movie-of-the-week in him. 
They had called him from the Callisons' around twelve-thirty and his father sounded a bit 
drunk - Dennis guessed he was maybe on his second bloody Mary and was maybe getting 
some disapproving looks from Mom. Dennis himself had just been finishing up his dietician-
approved bluecarded Thanksgiving dinner - the only such dinner he had ever been able to 
finish in fifteen minutes - and he did a good job of sounding cheerful, not wanting to spoil 
their good time. Ellie came on the wire briefly, sounding giggly and rather screamy. Maybe it 
was talking to Ellie that had tired him out enough to need a nap. 
He had fallen asleep (and had his unsettling dream) around two o'clock. The hospital was 
unusually quiet today, running on a skeleton staff. The usual babble of TVs and transistor 
radios from the other rooms was muted. The candy-striper who took his tray smiled brightly 
and said I she hoped he had enjoyed his 'special dinner.' Dennis assured her that he had. After 
all, it was Thanksgiving for her, too. 
And so he dreamed, and the dream broke up and became a darker sleep, and when he woke 
up it was nearly five o'clock and Arnie Cunningham was sitting in the hard plastic contour 
chair where his girl had sat only the day before. 
Dennis was not at all surprised to see him there; he simply assumed that it was a new 
dream. 
'Hi, Arnie,' he said. 'How's it hanging?' 
'Hanging good,' Arnie said, 'but you look like you're still asleep, Dennis. Want some head-
noogies? That'll wake you up.' 
There was a brown bag on his lap, and Dennis's sleepy mind thought: Got his lunch after 
all. Maybe Repperton didn't squash it as bad as we thought. He tried to sit up in the bed, hurt 
his back, and used the control panel to get into what was almost a sitting position. The motor 
whined. 'Jesus, it's really you!' 
'Were you expecting Ghidrah, the Three-Headed Monster?' Arnie asked amiably. 
'I was sleeping. I guess I thought I still was.' Dennis rubbed his forehead hard, as if to get 
rid of the steep behind it. 'Happy Thanksgiving, Arnie.' 
'You bet,' Arnie said. 'Same to you. Did they feed you turkey with all the trimmings?' 
Dennis laughed. 'I got something that looked like those play-dinners that came with Ellie's 
Happy-Time Cafeteria when she was about seven. Remember?' 
Arnie put his cupped hands to his mouth and made ralphing noises. 'I remember. What a 
gross-out.'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'I'm really glad you came,' Dennis said, and for a moment he was perilously close to tears. 
Maybe he hadn't realized just how depressed he had been, He redoubled his determination to 
be home by Christmas. If he was here on Christmas Day, he'd probably commit suicide. 
'Your folks didn't come?' 
'Sure they did,' Dennis said, 'and they'll be back again tonight - Mom and Dad will be, 
anyway - but it's not the same. You know.' 
'Yeah. Well, I brought some stuff. Told the lady downstairs I had your bathrobe.' Arnie 
giggled a little. 
'What is that?' Dennis asked, nodding at the bag. It wasn't just a lunchbag, he saw; it was a 
shopping bag. 
'Aw, I raided the fridge after we et the bird,' Arnie said. 'My mom and dad went around 
visiting their friends from the University - they do that every year on Thanksgiving afternoon. 
They won't even be back until around eight.' 
As he talked, he took things out of the bag. Dennis watched, amazed. Two pewter candle-
holders. Two candles. Arnie slammed the candles into the holders, lit them with a matchbook 
advertising Darnell's Garage, and turned off the overhead light. Then four sandwiches, 
clumsily wrapped in waxed paper. 
'The way I recall it,' Arnie said, 'you always said that scarfing up a couple of turkey 
sandwiches around eleven-thirty Thursday night was better than Thanksgiving dinner, 
anyway. Because the pressure was off.' 
'Yeah,' Dennis said. 'Sandwiches in front of the TV, Carson or some old movie. But, honest 
to God, Arnie, you didn't have to - ' 
'Ali, shit, I haven't even been around to see you in almost three weeks. Good thing for me 
you were sleeping when I came in or you probably would have shot me.' He tapped Dennis's 
two sandwiches. 'Your favourite, I think. White meat and mayo on Wonder Bread.' 
Dennis got giggling at that, then laughing, then roaring. Arnie could see it hurt his back, but 
he couldn't stop. Wonder Bread had been one of Arnie and Dennis's great common secrets as 
children. Both of their mothers had been very serious about the subject of bread; Regina 
bought Diet-Thin loaves, with an occasional side-trip into the Land of Stone-Ground Rye. 
Dennis's mother favoured Roman Meal and pumpernickel loaves. Arnie and Dennis ate what 
was given them - but both were secret Wonder Bread freaks, and more than one occasion 
they had pooled their money and instead of buying sweets they had gotten a loaf of Wonder 
and a jar of French's Mustard. They would then slink out into Arnie's garage (or Dennis's 
tree-house, sadly demolished in a windstorm almost nine years before) and gobble mustard 
sandwiches and read Richie Rich comic books until the whole loaf was gone. 
Arnie joined him in his laughter, and for Dennis that was the best part of Thanksgiving.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">* * * * * 
Dennis had been between room-mates for almost ten days, and so had the semi-private 
room to himself. Arnie closed the door and produced a six-pack of Busch beer from the 
brown bag. 
'Wonders will never cease,' Dennis said, and had to laugh again at the unintentional pun,  
'No,' Arnie said, 'I don't think they ever will.' He toasted Dennis over the candles with a 
bottle of beer. 'Prosit.'  
'Live for ever,' Dennis responded. They drank. 
After they had finished the thick turkey sandwiches, Arnie produced two plastic 
Tupperware pie-wedges from his apparently bottomless bag and prised off the lids. Two 
pieces of home-made apple pie rested within. 
'No, man, I can't,' Dennis said. 'I'll bust.' 
'Eat,' Arnie commanded. 
'I really can't,' Dennis said, taking the Tupperware container and a fresh plastic fork. He 
finished the slice of pie in four huge bites and then belched. He upended the remainder of his 
second beer and belched again. 'In Portugal, that's a compliment to the cook,' he said. His 
head was buzzing pleasantly from the beer. 
'Whatever you say,' Arnie responded with a grin. He got up, turned on the overhead 
fluorescent, and snuffed the candles. Outside a steady rain had begun to beat against the 
windows; it looked and sounded cold. And for Dennis, some of the warm spirit of friendship 
and real Thanksgiving seemed to go out with the candles. 
'I'm gonna hate you tomorrow,' Dennis said. 'I'll probably have to sit on that john in there 
for an hour. And it hurts my back.' 
'You remember the time Elaine got the farts?' Arnie asked, and they both laughed. 'We 
teased her until your mother gave us holy old hell.' 
'They didn't smell, but they sure were loud,' Dennis said, smiling. 
'Like gunshots,' Arnie agreed, and they both laughed a little - but it was a sad sort of 
laughter, if there is such a thing. A lot of water under the bridge. The thought that Ellie's 
attack of the farts had happened seven years ago was somehow more unsettling than it was 
amusing. There was a breath of mortality in the realization that seven years could steal past 
with such smooth and unobtrusive ease. 
Conversation lapsed a little, both of them lost in their own thoughts. 
At last Dennis said, 'Leigh came by yesterday. Told me, about Christine. I'm sorry, man. 
Bummer.'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Arnie looked up, and his expression of thoughtful melancholy was lost in a cheerful smile 
that Dennis didn't really believe. 
'Yeah,' he said. 'It was crude. But I went way overboard about it.' 
'Anyone would,' Dennis said, aware that he had become suddenly watchful, hating it but 
unable to help it. The friendship part was over; it had been here, warming the room and 
filling it, and now it had simply slipped away like the ephemeral, delicate thing it was. Now 
they were just dancing. Arnie's cheerful eyes were also opaque and - he would have sworn to 
it - watchful. 
'Sure. I gave my mother a hard time. Leigh too, I guess. It was just the shock of seeing all 
that work . . . all that work down the tubes.' He shook his head. 'Bad news.' 
'Are you going to be able to do anything with it?' Arnie brightened immediately - really 
brightened this time, Dennis felt. 'Sure! I already have. You wouldn't believe it, Dennis, if 
you'd seen the way it looked in that parking lot. They made them tough in those days, not like 
now when all the stuff that looks like metal is really just shiny plastic. That car is nothing but 
a damn tank. The glass was the worst part. And the tyres, of course. They slashed the tyres.' 
'What about the engine?' 
'Never got at it,' Arnie said promptly, and that was the first lie. They had been at it, all right. 
When Arnie and Leigh had gotten to Christine that afternoon, the distributor cap had been 
lying on the pavement. Leigh had recognized it and had told Dennis about it. What else had 
they done under the hood, Dennis wondered. The radiator? If someone was going to use a 
tyre iron to punch holes in the bodywork, might they not be apt to use the same tool to spring 
the radiator in a few places? What about the plugs? The voltage regulator? The carburettor? 
Arnie, why are you lying to me? 
'So what are you doing with it now?' Dennis asked. 
'Spending money on it, what else?' Arnie said, and laughed his almost-genuine laugh. 
Dennis might even have accepted it as genuine if he hadn't heard the real article once or twice 
over the Thanksgiving supper Arnie had brought. 'New tyres, new glass. Got some bodywork 
to do, and then it will be as good as new.' 
As good as new. But Leigh had said that they had found something that was little more than 
a smashed hulk, a carny three-swings-for-a-quarter derelict. 
Why are you lying? 
For a cold moment he found himself wondering if maybe Arnie hadn't gone a little crazy - 
but no, that wasn't the impression he gave. The feeling Dennis got from him was one of . . . 
furtiveness. Craftiness. Then, for the first time, the crazy thought came to him, the thought 
that maybe Arnie was only half-lying, trying to lay a groundwork of plausibility for . . . for 
what? A case of spontaneous regeneration? That was pretty crazy, wasn't it?</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Wasn't it? 
It was indeed, Dennis thought, unless you had happened to see a mass of cracks in a 
windscreen seem to shrink between one viewing and the next. 
Just a trick of the light. That's what you thought then, and you were right. 
But a trick of the light didn't explain the haphazard way Arnie had gone about rebuilding 
Christine, the hopscotch of old and new parts. It didn't explain that weird feeling Dennis had 
gotten sitting behind the wheel of Christine in LeBay's garage, or the sense, after the new tyre 
had been put on en route to Darnell's, that he was looking at an old-car picture with a new-car 
picture directly underlying it, and that a hole had been cut out of the old-car picture at the 
spot where one of the old-car tyres had been. 
And nothing explained Arnie's lie now . . . or the narrow, thoughtful way he was watching 
Dennis to see if his lie was going to be accepted. So he smiled . . . a big, easy, relieved grin. 
'Well, that's great,' he said. 
Arnie's narrow, evaluating expression held for a moment longer; then he smiled an aw-
shucks grin and shrugged. 'Luck,' he said. 'When I think of the things they could have done 
sugar in the gas tank, molasses in the carb - they were stupid. Lucky for me.' 
 
'Repperton and his merry crew?' Dennis asked quietly. 
The suspicious look, so dark and unlike Arnie, appeared again and then sank from sight. 
Arnie looked grim now. Grim and morose. He seemed to speak, then sighed instead. 'Yeah,' 
he said. 'Who else?' 
'But you didn't report it.' 
'My dad did.' 
'That's what Leigh said.' 
'What else did she tell you?' Arnie asked sharply. 
'Nothing, and I didn't ask,' Dennis said, holding his hand out. 'Your business, Arnie. Peace.' 
'Sure.' He laughed a little and then passed a hand over his face. 'I'm still not over it. Fuck. I 
don't think I'm ever going to be over it, Dennis. Coming into that parking lot with Leigh, 
feeling like I was on top of the world, and seeing - ' 
'Won't they just do it again if you fix her up again?' Arnie's face went dead-cold, set. 'They 
won't do it again,' he said. His grey eyes were like March ice, and Dennis found himself 
suddenly very glad he wasn't Buddy Repperton. 
'What do you mean?'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'I'll be parking it at home, that's what I mean,' he said, and once more his face broke into 
that large, cheerful, unnatural grin. 'What did you think I meant?' 
'Nothing,' Dennis said. The image of ice remained. Now it was a feeling of thin ice, 
creaking uneasily under his feet. Beneath that, black, cold water. 'But I don't know, Arnie. 
You seem awful sure that Buddy wants to let this go.' 
'I'm hoping he'll see it as a standoff,' Arnie said quietly. 'We got him expelled from school 
'He got himself expelled!' Dennis said hotly. 'He pulled a knife - hell, it wasn't even a knife, 
it was a goddam pigsticker!' 
I'm just telling it the way he'll see it,' Arnie said, then held out his hand and laughed. 
'Peace.' 
'Yeah, okay.' 
'We got him expelled - or more accurately, I did - and he and his buddies beat hell out of 
Christine. Evens. The end.' 
'Yeah, if he sees it that way.' 
'I think he will,' Arnie said. 'The cops questioned him and Moochie Welch and Richie 
Trelawney. Scared them. And almost got Sandy Galton to confess, I guess.' Arnie's lip curled. 
'Fucking crybaby.' 
This was so unlike Arnie - the old Arnie - that Dennis sat up in bed without thinking and 
then winced at the pain in his back and lay down again quickly. 'Jesus, man, you sound like 
you want him to stonewall it!' 
'I don't care what he or any of those shitters do,' Arnie said, and then, in a strangely offhand 
voice he added, 'It doesn't matter anymore anyhow.' 
Dennis said, 'Arnie, are you all right?' 
And for a moment a look of desperate sadness passed over Arnie's face - more than 
sadness. He looked harried and haunted. It was the face, Dennis thought later (it is so easy to 
see these things later; too much later) of someone so bewildered and entangled and weary of 
struggling that he hardly knows anymore what it is he is doing. 
Then that expression, like that other look of dark suspicion, was gone. 
'Sure,' he said. 'I'm great. Except that you're not the only one with a hurt back. You 
remember when I strained it at Philly Plains?' 
Dennis nodded. 
'Check this out.' He stood up and pulled his shirt out of his pants. Something seemed to 
dance in his eyes. Something flipping and turning at a black depth.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">He lifted his shirt. It wasn't old-fashioned like LeBay's; it was cleaner, too - a neat, 
seemingly unbroken band of Lycra about twelve inches across. But, Dennis thought, a brace 
was a brace. It was too close to LeBay for comfort. 
'I put another hurt on it getting Christine back to Will's,' Arnie said. 'I don't even remember 
how I did it, that's how upset I was. Hooking her up to the wrecker, I guess, but I don't know 
for sure. At first it wasn't too bad, then it got worse. Dr Mascia prescribed - Dennis, are you 
okay?' 
With what felt like a fantastic effort, Dennis kept his voice even. He moved his features 
around into an expression which felt at least faintly like pleasant interest . . . and still there 
was that something dancing in Arnie's eyes, dancing and dancing. 
'You'll shake it off,' Dennis said 
'Sure, I imagine,' Arnie said, tucking his shirt back in around the back brace. 'I'm just 
supposed to watch what I lift so I don't do it again.' 
He smiled at Dennis. 
'If there was stilt a draft, it would keep me out of the Army,' he said. 
Once again Dennis restrained himself from any movement that could be interpreted as 
surprise, but he put his arms under the bed's top sheet. At the sight of that back brace, so like 
LeBay's, they had broken out in gooseflesh. 
Arnie's eyes - like black water under thin grey March ice. Black water and glee dancing far 
down within them like the twisting, decomposing body of a drowned man. 'Listen,' Arnie said 
briskly. 'I gotta move. Hope you didn't think I could hang around a lousy place like this all 
night.' 
'That's you, always in demand,' Dennis said. 'Seriously, man, thanks. You cheered up a 
grim day.' 
For one strange instant, he thought Arnie was going to weep. That dancing thing down deep 
in his eyes was gone and his friend was there - really there. Then Arnie smiled sincerely. 'Just 
remember one thing, Dennis: nobody misses you. Nobody at all.' 
'Eat me raw through a Flavour Straw,' Dennis said solemnly. 
Arnie gave him the finger 
The formalities were now complete; Arnie could leave He gathered up his brown shopping 
bag, considerably deflated, candle-holders and empty beer bottles clinking inside. 
Dennis had a sudden inspiration. He rapped his knuckles on his leg cast. 'Sign this, Arnie, 
would you?' 
'I already did, didn't I?'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'Yeah, but it wore off. Sign it again?' 
Arnie shrugged. 'If you've got a pen.' 
Dennis gave him one from the drawer of the night-table. Grinning, Arnie bent over the cast, 
which was hoisted to an angle over the bed with a series of weights and pulleys, found white 
space in the intaglio of names and mottoes, and scribbled: 
For Dennis Guilder, The                                                                                                      
Worlds Biggest Dork                                                                                                                                
Arnie Cunningham 
He patted the cast when he was done and handed the pen back to Dennis. 'Okay?' 
'Yeah,' Dennis said. 'Thanks. Stay loose, Arnie.' 
'You know it. Happy Thanksgiving.' 
'Same to you.' 
Arnie left. Later on, Dennis's mother and father came in; Ellie, apparently exhausted by the 
day's hilarity, had gone home to bed, On their way home, the Guilders commented to each 
other on how withdrawn Dennis had seemed. 
'He was in a blue study, all right,' Guilder said. 'Holidays in the hospital aren't any fun.' 
As for Dennis himself, he spent a long and thoughtful time that evening examining two 
signatures. Arnie had indeed signed his cast, but at a time when both of Dennis's legs had 
been in full-leg casts. That first time, he had signed the cast on the right leg, which had been 
up in the air when Arnie came in. Tonight he had signed the left. 
Dennis buzzed for a nurse and used all his charm persuading her to lower his left leg so he 
could compare the two signatures, side by side. The cast on his right leg had been cut down, 
and would come off altogether in a week or ten days. Arnie's signature had not rubbed off - 
that had been one of Dennis's lies - but it had very nearly been cut off. 
Arnie had not written a message on the right leg, only his signature. With some effort (and 
some pain), Dennis and the nurse were able to manoeuvre his legs close enough together so 
he could study the two signatures side by side. In a voice so dry and cracked he was hardly 
able to recognize it as his own, he asked the nurse, 'Do they look the same to you?' 
'No,' the nurse said. 'I've beard of forging cheques, but never casts. Is it a joke?' 
'Sure,' Dennis said, feeling an icy coldness rise from his stomach to his chest. 'It's a joke.' 
He looked at the signatures; he looked at them side by side and felt that rising coldness steal 
all through him, lowering his body temperature, making the hairs on the back of his neck stir 
and stiffen:</p>

They were nothing alike. 
Late that Thanksgiving night, a cold wind rose, first gusting, then blowing steadily. The 
clear eye of the moon stared down from a black sky. The last brown and withered leaves of 
autumn were ripped from the trees and then harried through the gutters. They made a sound 
like rolling bones. 
Winter had come to Libertyville.</p>

The Thursday after thanksgiving was the last day of November, the night that Jackson 
Browne played the Pittsburgh Civic Centre to a sellout crowd. Moochie Welch went up with 
Richie Trelawney and Nicky Biltingham but got separated from them even before the show 
began. He was spare-changing, and whether it was because the impending Browne concert 
had created some extremely mellow vibes or because he was becoming something of an 
endearing fixture (Moochie, a romantic, liked to believe the latter), he had had a remarkably 
good night. He had collected nearly thirty dollars' worth of 'spare change'. It was distributed 
among all his pockets; Moochie jingled like a piggy bank. Thumbing home had been 
remarkably easy too, with all the traffic leaving the Civic Centre. The concert ended at 
eleven-forty, and he was back in Libertyville shortly after one-fifteen. 
His last ride was with a young guy who was headed back to Prestonville on Route 63. The 
guy dropped him at the 376 ramp on JFK Drive. Moochie decided to walk up to 
Vandenberg's Happy Gas and see Buddy. Buddy had a car, which meant that Moochie, who 
lived far out on Kingsfield Pike, wouldn't have to walk home. It was hard work, hitching 
rides, once you got out in the boonies - and the Kingsfield Pike was Boondocks City. It meant 
he wouldn't be home until well past dawn, but in cold weather a sure ride was not to be 
sneezed at. And Buddy might have a bottle. 
He had walked a quarter of a mile from the 376 exit ramp in the deep single-number cold, 
his cleated heels clicking on the deserted sidewalk, his shadow waxing and waning under the 
eerie orange streetlamps, and had still perhaps a mile to go when he saw the car parked at the 
curb up ahead. Exhaust curled out of its twin pipes and hung in the perfectly still air, clouding 
it, before drifting lazily away in stacked layers. The grille, bright chrome highlighted with 
pricks of orange light, looked at him like a grinning idiot mouth. Moochie recognized the car. 
It was a two-tone Plymouth. In the light of the maximum-illumination streetlamps the two 
tones seemed to be ivory and dried blood. It was Christine. 
Moochie stopped, and a stupid sort of wonder flooded through him - it was not fear, at least 
not at that moment. It couldn't be Christine, that was impossible - they had punched a dozen 
holes in the radiator of Cuntface's car, they had dumped a nearly full bottle of Texas Driver 
into the carb, and Buddy had produced a five-pound sack of Domino sugar, which he had</p>
      <p class="calibre3">tunnelled into the gas tank through Moochie's cupped hands. And all of that was just for 
starters. Buddy had demonstrated a kind of furious invention when it came to destroying 
Cuntface's car; it had left Moochie feeling both delighted and uneasy. All in all, that car 
should not have moved under its own power for six months, if ever. So this could not be 
Christine. It was some other '58 Fury. 
Except it was Christine. He knew it. 
Moochie stood there on the deserted early-morning sidewalk, his numb ears poking out 
from beneath his long hair, his breath pluming frostily on the air. 
The car sat at the curb facing him, engine growling softly. It was impossible to tell who, if 
anyone, was behind the wheel; it was parked directly beneath one of the streetlights, and the 
orange globe burned across the glass of the unmarred windshield like a waterproof jack-o'-
lantern seen deep down in dark water. 
Moochie began to be afraid 
He slicked his tongue over dry lips and looked around. To his left was JFK Drive, six lanes 
wide and looking like a dry riverbed at this empty hour of the morning. To his right was a 
photography shop, orange letters outlined in red spelling KODAK across its window. 
He looked back at the car. It just sat there, idling. 
He opened his mouth to speak and produced no sound. He tried again and got a croak. 'Hey. 
Cunningham.' 
The car sat, seeming to brood. Exhaust curled up. The engine rumbled, idling fast on high-
octane gas. 
'That you, Cunningham?' 
He took one more step. A cleat scraped on cement. His heart was thudding in his neck. He 
looked around at the street again; surely another car would come, JFK Drive couldn't be 
totally deserted even at one-twenty-five in the morning, could it? But there were no cars, only 
the flat orange glare of the streetlights. 
Moochie cleared his throat. 
'You ain't mad, are you?' 
Christine's duals suddenly came on, pinning him in harsh white light. The Fury ripped 
toward him, peeling out, the tyres screaming black slashes of rubber onto the pavement. It 
came with such sudden power that the rear end seemed to squat, like the haunches of a dog 
preparing to spring - a dog or a she-wolf. The onside wheels jumped up on the pavement and 
it ran at Moochie that way, offside wheels down, onside wheels up over the curb, canted at an 
angle. The undercarriage scraped and shrieked and shot off a swirling flicker of sparks.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Moochie screamed and tried to sidestep. The edge of Christine's bumper barely flicked his 
left calf and took a chunk of meat. Warm wetness coursed down his leg and puddled in his 
shoe. The warmth of his own blood made him realize in a confused way just how cold the 
night was. 
He thudded hip-first into the doorway of the photo shop, barely missing the plate-glass 
window. A foot to the left and he would have crashed right through, landing-in a litter of 
Nikons and Polaroid One-Steps. 
He could hear the car's engine, suddenly revving up. That horrible, unearthly shrieking of 
the undercarriage on the cement again. Moochie turned around, panting harshly. Christine 
was reversing back up the gutter, and as it passed him, he saw. He saw. 
There was no one behind the wheel. 
Panic began to pound in his head. Moochie took to his heels. He ran out into JFK Drive, 
sprinting for the far side. There was an alley over there between a market and a dry-cleaning 
place. Too narrow for the car. If he could get in there - 
Change jingled madly in his pants pockets and in the five or six pockets of his Army-
surplus duffel coat. Quarters, nickels, dimes. A jingling silver carillon. He pumped his knees 
almost to his chin. His cleated engineer boots drummed the pavement. His shadow chased 
him. 
The car somewhere behind him revved again, fell off, revved again, fell off, and then the 
motor began to shriek. The tyres wailed, and Christine shot at Moochie Welch's back, 
crossing the lanes of JFK Drive at right angles. Moochie screamed and could not hear himself 
scream because the car was still peeling rubber, the car was still shrieking like an insanely 
angry, murderous woman, and that shriek filled the world. 
His shadow was no longer chasing him. It was leading him and getting longer. In the 
window of the dry-cleaning shop he saw great yellow eyes blossom. 
It wasn't even close. 
At the very last moment Moochie tried to jig left, but Christine jigged with him as if she 
had read his final desperate thought. The Plymouth hit him squarely, still accelerating, 
breaking Moochie Welch's back and knocking him spang out of his engineer's boots. He was 
thrown forty feet into the brick siding of the little market, again narrowly missing a plunge 
through a plate-glass window. 
The force of his strike was hard enough to cause him to rebound into the street again, 
leaving a splash of blood on the brick like an inkblot. A picture of it would appear the next 
day on the front page of the Libertyville Journal-Standard. 
Christine reversed, screeched to a skidding, sliding stop, and roared forward again. 
Moochie lay near the curbing, trying to get up. He couldn't get up. Nothing seemed to work. 
All the signals were scrambled.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Bright white light washed over him. 
'No,' he whispered through a mouthful of broken teeth. 'N - ' 
The car roared forward and over him. Change flew everywhere. Mooche was pulled and 
rolled first one way and then the other as Christine reversed into the street again. She stood 
there, engine revving and falling off to a rich idle, then revving again. She stood there as if 
thinking. 
Then she came at him again. She hit him, jumped the curb, skidded around, and then 
reversed again, thumping back down. 
She screamed forward. 
And back. 
And forward. 
Her headlights glared. Her exhaust pipes jetted hot blue smoke. 
The thing in the street no longer looked like a human being; it looked like a scattered 
bundle of rags. 
The car reversed a final time, skidded around in a half-circle, and accelerated, roaring over 
the bleeding bundle in the street again and going down the Drive, the blast of its engine, still 
winding up to full rev, rocketing off the walls of the sleeping buildings - but not entirely 
sleeping now; lights were beginning to flick on, people who lived over their stores were 
going to their windows to see what all the racket had been about, and if there had been an 
accident. 
One of Christine's headlights had been shattered. Another flickered unsteadily off and on, 
bleared with a thin wash of Moochie's blood. The grille had been bent inward, and the dents 
in it approximated the shape and size of Moochie's torso with all the gruesome perfection of a 
deathmask. Blood was splashed across the hood in fans that spread out as windspeed 
increased. The exhaust had taken on a heavy, blatting sound; one of Christine's two silencers 
had been destroyed. 
Inside, on the instrument panel, the milometer continued to run backward, as if Christine 
were somehow slipping back into time, leaving not only the scene of the hit-and-run behind 
but the actual fact of the hit-and-run. 
The silencer was the first thing. 
Suddenly that heavy, blatting sound diminished and smoothed out. 
The fans of blood on the hood began to run toward the front of the car again in spite of the 
wind - as if a movie film had been reversed.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">The flickering headlight suddenly shone steadily, and a tenth of a mile later the deadlight 
became a headlight again. With an unimportant tinkling sound - no more than the sound of a 
small boy's boot breaking the thin scum of ice on a mudpuddle - the glass reassembled itself 
from nowhere. 
There was a hollow punk! punk! punk! sound from the front end, the sound of denting 
metal, the sound you sometimes get when you squeeze a beer-can. But instead of denting, 
Christine's grille was popping back out - a bodyshop veteran with fifty years' experience in 
putting fender-benders right could not have done it more neatly. 
Christine turned onto Hampton Street even before the first of those awakened by the 
screaming of her tyres had reached Moochie's remains. The blood was gone. It had reached 
the front of the hood and disappeared. The scratches were gone. As she rolled quietly toward 
the garage door with its HONK FOR ENTRY sign, there was one final punk! as the last dimple 
- this one in the left front bumper, the spot where Christine had struck Moochie's calf - 
popped back out. 
Christine looked like new. 
The car stopped in front of the large garage door in the middle of the darkened, silent 
building. There was a small plastic box clipped to the driver's side sun-visor. This was a little 
doodad Will Darnell had given Arnie when Arnie began to run cigarettes and booze over into 
New York State for him - it was, perhaps, Darnell s version of a gold key to the crapper. 
In the still air the door-opener hummed briefly, and the garage door rattled obediently up. 
Another circuit was made by the rising door, and a few interior rights came on, burning 
weakly. 
The headlight knob on the dashboard suddenly went in, and Christine's duals went out. She 
rolled inside and whispered across the oil-stained concrete to stall twenty. Behind her, the 
overhead door, which had been set on a thirty-second timer, rolled back down. The light 
circuit was broken, and the garage was dark again. 
In Christine's ignition switch, the keys dangling down suddenly turned to the left. The 
engine died. The leather patch with the initials R.D.L. branded into it swung back and forth in 
decreasing arcs and was finally still. 
Christine sat in the dark, and the only sound in Darnell's Do-It-Yourself Garage was the 
slow tick of her cooling engine.</p>

Arnie Cunningham did not go to school the next day. He said he thought he might be 
coming down with the flu. But that evening he told his parents that he felt enough improved 
to go down to Darnell's and do some work on Christine. 
Regina protested - although she did not come right out and say so, she thought Arnie looked 
like death warmed over. His face was now entirely free of acne and blemishes, but there was 
a trade-off: it was much too pale, and there were dark circles under his eyes, as if he hadn't 
been sleeping. In addition, he was still limping. She wondered uneasily if her son could be 
using some sort of drug, if perhaps he had hurt his back worse than he had let on and had 
started taking pills so he could go on working on the goddamned car. Then she dismissed the 
thought. Obsessed as he might be with the car, Arnie could not be that stupid. 
'I'm really fine, Mom,' he said. 
'You don't look fine. And you hardly touched your supper.' 
'I'll get some chow later on.' 
'How's your back? You're not lifting a lot of heavy stuff down there, are you?' 
'No, Mom.' This was a lie. And his back had hurt terribly all day long. This was the worst it 
had been since the original injury at Philly Plains (oh, was that where it started? His mind 
whispered, oh really? Are you sure?). He had taken the brace off for a while, and his back 
had throbbed fit to kill him. He had put it on again after only fifteen minutes, cinching it 
tighter than ever. Now his back really was a little better. And he knew why. He was going to 
her. That was why. 
Regina looked at him, worried and at a loss. For the first time in her life she simply did not 
know how to proceed. Arnie was beyond her control now. Knowing it brought on a horrible 
feeling of despair that sometimes crept up on her and filled her brain with an awful, empty, 
rotten coldness. At these times a depression so total she could barely credit it would steal 
through her, making her wonder exactly what it was she had lived her life for - so her son 
could fall in love with a girl and a car all in the same terrible fall? Was that it? So she could 
see exactly how hateful to him she had become when she looked in his grey eyes? Was that</p>
      <p class="calibre3">it? And it really didn't have anything to do with the girl at all, did it? No. In her mind, it 
always came back to the car. Her rest had become broken and uneasy, and for the first time 
since her miscarriage nearly twenty years before, she had found herself considering making 
an appointment with Dr Mascia to see if he would give her some pill for the stress and the 
depression and the attendant insomnia. She thought about Arnie on her long sleepless nights, 
and about mistakes that could never be rectified; she thought about how time had a way of 
swinging the balance of power on its axis, and how old age had a way of sometimes looking 
through a dressing-table mirror like the hand of a corpse poking through eroded earth. 
'Will you be back early?' she asked, knowing this was the last breastwork of the truly 
powerless parent, hating it, unable - now - to change it. 
'Sure,' he said, but she didn't much trust the way he said it. 
'Arnie, I wish you'd stay home. You really don't look good at all.' 
'I'll be fine,' he said. 'Got to be. I have to run some auto parts over to Jamesburg for Will 
tomorrow.' 
'Not if you're sick,' she said. 'That's nearly a hundred and fifty miles.' 
'Don't worry.' He kissed her cheek - the passionless kiss-on-the-cheek-of cocktail-party 
acquaintances. 
He was opening the kitchen door to go out when Regina asked, 'Did you know the boy who 
was run down last night on Kennedy Drive?' 
He turned back to look at her, his face expressionless. 'What?' 
'The paper said he went to Libertyville. 
'Oh, the hit-and-run that's what you're talking about.' 
'Yes.' 
'I had a class with him when I was a freshman,' Arnie said. 'I think. No, I really didn't know 
him, Mom.'  
'Oh.' She nodded, pleased. 'That's good. The paper said there were residues of drugs in his 
system. You'd never take drugs, would you, Arnie?' 
Arnie smiled gently at her pallid, watchful face. 'No, Mom,' he said. 
'And if your back started to hurt you - I mean, if it really started to hurt you - you'd go see 
Dr Mascia about it, wouldn't you? You wouldn't buy anything from a . . . a drug-pusher, 
would you?' 
'No, Mom,' he repeated, and went out. 
* * * * *</p>
      <p class="calibre3">There had been more snow. Another thaw had melted most of it, but this time it had not 
disappeared completely; it had only withdrawn into the shadows, where it formed a white 
rime under hedges, the bases of trees, the overhang of the garage. But in spite of the snow 
around the edges - or maybe because of it - their lawn looked oddly green as Arnie stepped 
out into the twilight, and his father looked like a strange refugee from summer as he raked the 
last of the autumn leaves. 
Arnie raised his hand briefly to his father and made as if to go past without speaking. 
Michael called him over. Arnie went reluctantly He didn't want to be late for his bus. 
His father had also aged in the storms that had blown up over Christine, although other 
things had undoubtedly played a part. He had made a bid for the chairmanship of the History 
Department at Horlicks late in the summer and had been rebuffed quite soundly. And during 
his annual October checkup, the doctor had pointed out an incipient phlebitis problem - 
phlebitis, which had nearly killed Nixon; phlebitis, an old folks' problem. As that late fall 
moved toward another grey western-Pennsylvania winter, Michael Cunningham looked 
gloomier than ever. 
'Hi, Dad. Listen, I've got to hurry if I'm going to catch - ' 
Michael looked up from the little pile of frozen brown leaves he had managed to get 
together; the sunset caught the planes of his face and appeared to make them bleed. Arnie 
stepped back involuntarily, a little shocked. His father's face was haggard. 
'Arnold,' he said, 'where were you last night?' 
'What - ?' Arnie gaped, then closed his mouth slowly. 'Why, here. Here, Dad. You know 
that.' 
'All night?' 
'Of course. I went to bed at ten o'clock. I was bushed. Why?' 
'Because I had a call from the police today,' Michael said. 'About that boy who was run 
over on JFK Drive last night.' 
'Moochie Welch,' Arnie said. He looked at his father with calm eyes that were deeply 
circled and socketed for all their calmness. If the son had been shocked by the father's 
appearance, the father was also dully shocked by his son's to Michael, the boy's eyesockets 
looked nearly like a skull's vacant orbs in the failing light. 
'The last name was Welch, yes' 
'They would be in touch. I suppose. Mom doesn't know - that he might have been one of the 
guys that trashed Christine?' 
'Not from me.' 
I didn't tell her either. I'd be glad if she didn't find that out,' Arnie said.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'She may find it out eventually,' Michael said. 'In fact, she almost certainly will. She's an 
extremely intelligent woman, in case you've never noticed. But she won't find it out from me.' 
Arnie nodded, then smiled humourlessly. “'Where were you last night?” Your trust is 
touching, Dad.' 
Michael flushed, but his eyes didn't drop. 'Maybe if you'd been standing outside yourself 
these last couple of months,' he said, 'you'd understand why I asked.' 
'What the hell does that mean?' 
'You know damn well. It hardly even bears discussing anymore. We just go around and 
around the same old mulberry bush. Your entire life is jittering apart and you stand there and 
ask me what I'm talking about.' 
Arnie laughed. It was a hard, contemptuous sound. Michael seemed to shrivel a little before 
it. 'Mom asked me if I was on drugs. Maybe you want to check that one out, too.' Arnie made 
as if to push up the sleeves of his warmup jacket. 'Want to check for needle-tracks?' 
'I don't need to ask if you're on drugs,' Michael said. 'You're only on one I know of, and 
that's enough. It's that goddam car.' 
Arnie turned as if to go, and Michael pulled him back. 
'Get your hand off my arm.' 
Michael dropped his hand. 'I wanted you to be aware,' he said. 'I no more think you'd kill 
someone than I think you could walk across the Symonds' swimming pool. But the police are 
going to question you, Arnie, and people can look surprised when the police turn up 
suddenly. To them, surprise can look like guilt.' 
'All of this because some drunk ran over that shitter Welch?' 
It wasn't like that,' Michael said. 'I got that much out of this fellow Junkins who called me 
up on the phone. Whoever killed the Welch boy ran him down and then backed over him and 
ran over him again and backed up again and - ' 
'Stop it,' Arnie said He suddenly looked sick and frightened, and Michael had much the 
same feeling Dennis had had on Thanksgiving evening: that in this tired unhappiness the real 
Arnie was suddenly close to the surface, perhaps reachable. 
'It was . . . incredibly brutal,' Michael said. 'That's what Junkins said. You see, it doesn't 
look like an accident at all. It looks like murder.' 
'Murder,' Arnie said, dazed. 'No, I never - ' 
'What?' Michael asked sharply. He grabbed Arnie's jacket again. 'What did you say?' 
Arnie looked at his father. His face was masklike again. 'I never thought it could be that,' he 
said. 'That's all I was going to say.'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'I just wanted you to know,' he said. 'They'll be looking for someone with a motive, no 
matter how thin. They know what happened to your car, and that the Welch boy might have 
been involved, or that you might think he was involved. Junkins may be around to talk to 
you.' 
'I don't have anything to hide.' 
'No, of course not,' Michael said. 'You'll miss your bus.' 
'Yeah,' Arnie said. 'Gotta go.' But he stayed a moment longer, looking at his father. 
Michael suddenly found himself thinking of Arnie's ninth birthday. He and his son had 
gone to the little zoo in Philly Plains, had eaten lunch out, and had finished the day by 
playing eighteen holes at the indoor miniature golf course on outer Basin Drive. That place 
had burned down in 1975. Regina had not been able to come, she had been flat on her back 
with bronchitis. The two of them had had a fine time. For Michael, that had been his son's 
best birthday, the one that symbolized for him above all others his son's sweet and uneventful 
American boyhood. They had gone to the zoo and come back and nothing much had 
happened except that they had had a great time - Michael and his son, who had been and who 
still was so dear to him. 
He wet his lips and said, 'Sell her, Arnie, why don't you? When she's completely restored, 
sell her away. You could get a lot of money. A couple - three thousand, maybe.' 
Again that frightened, tired look seemed to sweep over Arnie's face, but Michael couldn't 
tell for sure. The sunset had faded to a bitter orange line on the western horizon, and the little 
yard was dark. Then the look - if it had been there at all - went away. 
'No, I couldn't do that, Dad,' Arnie said gently, as if speaking to a child. 'I couldn't do that 
now. I've put too much into her. Way too much.' 
And then he was gone, cutting across the, yard to the sidewalk, joining the other shadows, 
and there was only the sound of his footfalls coming back, soon lost. 
Put too much into her? Have you? Exactly what, Arnie? What have you put into her? 
Michael looked down at the leaves, then around at his yard. Beneath the hedge and under 
the overhang of the garage, cold snow glimmered in the coming dark, livid and stubbornly 
waiting for reinforcements. Waiting for winter.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">32   REGINA AND MICHAEL 
 
She's real fine, my 409,                                                                                                                             
My four-speed, dual-quad, Positraction 409. 
                                - The Beach Boys 
 
Regina was tired - she tired more easily these days, it seemed - and they went to bed 
together around nine, long before Arnie came in. They made love that was dutiful and joyless 
(lately they made love a lot, it was almost always dutiful and joyless, and Michael had begun 
having the unpleasant feeling that his wife was using his penis as a sleeping pill), and as they 
lay in their twin beds after, Michael asked casually: 'How did you sleep last night?' 
'Quite well,' Regina said candidly, and Michael knew she was lying. Good. 
'I came up around eleven and Arnie seemed restless,' Michael said, still keeping his voice 
casual. He was deeply uneasy now - there had been something in Arnie's face tonight, 
something he hadn't been able to read because of the damned shadows. It was probably 
nothing, nothing at all, but it glowed in his mind like a baleful neon sign that simply would 
not shut off. Had his son looked guilty and scared? Or had it just been the light? Unless he 
could resolve that, sleep would be a long time coming tonight and it might not come at all. 
'I got up around one,' Regina said, and then hurried to add, 'Just to use the bathroom. I 
checked in on him.' She laughed a little wistfully. 'Old habits die hard, don't they?' 
'Yes,' Michael said. 'I guess they do.' 
'He was sleeping deeply then. I wish I could get him to wear pyjamas in cold weather.' 
'He was in his skivvies?' 
'Yes.' 
He settled back, immeasurably relieved and more than a little ashamed of himself as well. 
But it was better to know . . . for sure. It was all very well for him to tell Arnie that he knew 
the boy could no more commit a murder than he could walk on water. But the mind, that 
perverse monkey the mind can conceive of anything and seems to take a perverse delight in 
doing so. Just maybe, Michael thought, lacing his hands behind his head and looking up at 
the dark ceiling, just maybe that's the peculiar damnation of the living. In the mind a wife can 
rut, laughing, with a best friend, a best friend can cast plots against you and plan 
backstabbings, a son can commit murder by auto. 
Better to be ashamed and put the monkey to sleep.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Arnie had been here at one o'clock. It was unlikely Regina was mistaken about the time 
because of the digital clock-radio on their bureau - it told the time in numbers that were big 
and blue and unmistakable. His son had been here at one o'clock, and the Welch boy had 
been run down three miles away twenty-five minutes later. Impossible to believe that Arnie 
could have dressed, gone out (without Regina, who had surely been lying wakeful, hearing 
him), gone down to Darnell's, gotten Christine, and driven out to where Moochie Welch had 
been killed. Physically impossible. 
Not that he had ever believed it to begin with. 
The mind-monkey was satisfied. Michael rolled over on his right side, slept, and dreamed 
that he and his nine-year old son were playing miniature golf on an endless series of small 
Astro-Turfed greens where windmills turned and tiny water-hazards lay in wait . . . and he 
dreamed that they were alone, all alone in the world, because his son's mother had died in 
childbirth - very sad; people still remarked on how inconsolable Michael had been - but when 
they went home, he and his son, the house would be theirs alone, they would eat spaghetti 
right from the pot like a couple of bachelor slobs, and when the dishes were washed they 
would sit at a kitchen table hidden beneath spread newspapers and build model cars with 
harmless plastic engines. 
In his sleep Michael Cunningham smiled. Beside him, in the other bed, Regina did not. She 
lay awake and waited for the sound of the door that would tell her that her son had come in 
from the world outside. 
When she heard the door open and close . . . when she heard his step on the stairs . . . then 
she would be able to sleep. 
Maybe.</p>

Ride on, Josephine, ride on . . .  
                   - Ellas McDaniel 
 
Junkins turned up at Darnell's around eight-forty-five that evening. Arnie had just finished 
with Christine for the night. He had replaced the radio aerial that Repperton's gang had 
snapped off with a new one, and for the last fifteen minutes or so he had been sitting behind 
the wheel, listening to WDIL's Friday Night Cavalcade of Gold. 
He had meant to do no more than turn the radio on and dial across once, making sure that 
he had hooked up the aerial plug properly and that there was no static. But he had run onto 
WDIL's strong signal and had sat there, looking straight through the windscreen, his grey 
eyes musing and far away, as Bobby Fuller sang 'I Fought the Law', as Frankie Lymon and 
the Teenagers sang' Why Do Fools Fall in Love?', as Eddie Cochran sang 'C'mon, 
Everybody', and Buddy Holly sang 'Rave On'. There were no commercials on WDIL Friday 
nights, and no deejays. Just the sounds. Gone from the charts but not from our hearts. Every 
now and then a soothing female voice would break in and tell him what he already knew - 
that he was listening to WDIL Pittsburgh, the sound of Blue Suede Radio. 
Arnie sat dreaming behind the wheel, the red dash lights glowing, tapping his fingers 
lightly. The aerial was fine. Yes. He had done a good job. It was like Will said; he had a light 
touch, Look at Christine; Christine proved it. She had been a hunk of junk sitting on LeBay's 
lawn and he had brought her back; then she had been a hunk of junk sitting in the long-term 
lot out at the airport and he had brought her back again. He had . . . 
Rave on. . .  rave on and tell me . . .                                                                                                        
Tell me. . . not to be lonely. . . . 
He had what?</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Replaced the aerial, yes. And he had popped so -me of the dents, he could remember that. 
But he hadn't ordered any glass (although it was all replaced), he hadn't ordered any new seat 
covers (but they were all replaced, too), and he had only looked closely under the hood once 
before slamming it back down in horror at the damage they had done to Christine's mill. 
But now the radiator was whole, the engine block clean and glowing, the pistons moving 
free and clear. And it purred like a cat. 
But there had been dreams. 
He had dreamed of LeBay behind the wheel of Christine, LeBay dressed in an Army 
uniform that was spotted and splotched with blue-grey patches of graveyard mould, LeBay's 
flesh had sloughed and run. White, gleaming bone poked through in places. The sockets 
where LeBay's eyes had once been were empty and dark (but something was squirming in 
there, ah, yes, something). And then Christine's headlights had come on and someone had 
been pinned there, pinned like a bug on a white square of cardboard. Someone familiar. 
Moochie Welch? 
Maybe. But as Christine suddenly rocketed forward, tyres screaming, it had seemed to 
Arnie that the terrified face out there on the street ran like tallow, changing even as the 
Plymouth bore down on it: now it was Repperton's face, now Sandy Galton's, now it was Will 
Darnell's heavy moon face. 
Whoever was out there had jumped aside, but LeBay had thrown Christine into reverse, 
working the gear lever with black rotting fingers - a wedding ring hung on one, as loose as a 
hoop thrown over the branch of a dead tree - and then he threw it back into drive as the figure 
raced for the far side of the street. And as Christine bore down again, the head had turned, 
throwing a terrified glance backward, and Arnie had seen the face of his mother . . . the face 
of Dennis Guilder . . . Leigh's face, all eyes under a floating cloud of dark-blond hair . . . and 
finally his own face, the twisted mouth forming the words No! No! No! 
Overriding everything, even the heavy thunder of the exhaust (something underneath had 
been damaged for sure), was LeBay's rotting, triumphant voice, coming from a decayed 
larynx, passing lips that were already shrivelled away from the teeth and tattooed with a 
delicate spidering of dark green mould, LeBay's triumphant, shrieking voice: 
Here you go, you shitter! See how you like it! 
There had been the heavy, mortal thud of Christine's bumper striking flesh, the gleam of a 
pair of spectacles rising in the night air, turning over and over, and then Arnie had awakened 
in his room, curled into a trembling ball and clutching his pillow. It had been quarter of two 
in the morning, and his first feeling had been a great and terrible relief, relief that he was still 
alive. He was alive, LeBay was dead, and Christine was safe. The only three things in the 
world that mattered. 
Oh but Arnie, how did you hurt your back?</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Some voice inside, sly and insinuating - asking a question he was afraid to answer. 
I hurt it at Philly Plains, he had told everyone. One of the junkers started to slip back down 
the ramp of Will's flatbed and I pushed it back up - didn't think about it; I just did it. Strained 
something really bad. So he had said. And one of the junkers had started to slip, and he had 
pushed it back up, but that hadn't been how he hurt his back, had it? No. 
That night after he and Leigh had found Christine smashed to hell in the parking lot, sitting 
on four slashed tyres . . . that night at Darnell's, after everyone was gone . . . he had tuned the 
radio in Will's office to the oldies on WDIL. Will trusted him now, why not? He was running 
cigarettes across the state line into New York, he was running fireworks all the way over to 
Burlington, and twice he had run something wrapped in flat brown-paper packages into 
Wheeling, where a young guy in an old Dodge Challenger traded him another, slightly larger, 
brown-paper package, for it. Arnie thought maybe he was trading cocaine for money, but he 
didn't want to know for sure. 
He drove a boat on these trips, Will's private car, a 1966 Imperial as black as midnight in 
Persia. It was whisper-quiet, and the boot had a false bottom. If you kept to the speed limit, it 
was no problem. Why should it be? The important thing was that he now had the keys to the 
garage. He could come in after everyone else was gone. Like he had that night. And he had 
turned on WDIL and he had . . . he had . . . 
Hurt his back somehow. 
What had he been doing to hurt his back? 
A strange phrase came to him in answer, floating up from his subconscious: It's just a funny 
little glitch. 
Did he really want to know? He didn't. In fact, there were times when he didn't want the car 
at all. There were times when he felt he would be better off just . . . well, junking it. Not that 
he ever would, or could. It was just that, sometimes (in the sweaty, shaking aftermath of that 
dream last night, for instance), he felt that if he got rid of it, he would be . . . happier. 
The radio suddenly spat an almost feline burst of static. 
'Don't worry,' Arnie whispered. He ran his hand slowly over the, dashboard, loving the feel 
of it. Yes, the car frightened him sometimes. And he supposed his father was right; it had 
changed his life to some degree. But he could no more junk it than he could commit suicide. 
The static cleared. The Marvelettes were singing 'Please Mr Postman'. 
And then a voice said in his car, 'Arnold Cunningham?' He jumped and snapped off the 
radio. He turned around. A small, dapper little man was leaning in Christine's window. His 
eyes were a dark brown, and his colour was high - from the cold outside, Arnie guessed. 
'Yes?'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'Rudolph Junkins. State Police, Detective Division.' Junkins stuck his hand in through the 
open window. 
Arnie looked at it for a moment. So his father had been right. 
He grinned his most charming grin, took the hand, shook it firmly, and said, 'Don't shoot, 
copper, I'll throw out my guns.' 
Junkins returned Arnie's grin, but Arnie noticed that the grin did no more than touch his 
eyes, which were exploring the car in a quick, thorough fashion that Arnie didn't like. Not at 
all. 
'Whoo! I got the feeling from the local police that the guys who worked over your rolling 
iron had really tattooed it. It sure doesn't look like it.' 
Arnie shrugged and got out of the car. Friday nights were slow at the garage; Will himself 
rarely came in, and he wasn't in tonight. Across the way, in stall ten, a fellow named Gabbs 
was putting a new silencer on his old Valiant, and down at the far end of the garage there was 
the periodic burr on an air wrench as some fellow put on his snow tyres. Otherwise, he and 
Junkins had the place to themselves. 
'It wasn't anywhere near as bad as it looked,' Arnie said. He thought that this smiling, 
dapper little man might be extremely clever. As if it was a natural outgrowth of the thought, 
he rested his hand easily on Christine's roof and immediately felt better. He could cope with 
this man, clever or not. After all, what was there to worry about? 'There was no structural 
damage.' 
'Oh? I understood they punched holes in the body with some sharp instrument,' Junkins 
said, looking closely at Christine's flank. 'I'll be damned if I can see the fill. You must be a 
bodywork genius, Arnie. The way my wife drives, maybe I ought to put you on retainer,' He 
smiled disarmingly, but his eyes went on running back and forth over the car. They would 
dart momentarily to Arnie's face and then go back to the car again. Arnie liked it less and 
less. 
'I'm good but not God,' Arnie said. 'You can see the bodywork if you really look for it.' He 
pointed at a minute ripple in Christine's back deck . And there. 'He pointed at another. 'I was 
lucky enough to find some original Plymouth body parts up in Ruggles, I replaced the entire 
back door on this side. You see the way the paint doesn't quite match?' He knocked his 
knuckles on the door. 
'Nope,' Junkins said. 'I might be able to tell with a microscope, Arnie, but it looks like a 
perfect match to me.' 
He also knocked his knuckles on the door. Arnie frowned. 
'Hell of a job ' Junkins said. He walked slowly around to the front of the car. 'Hell of a job, 
Arnie. You're to be congratulated.'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'Thanks.' He watched as Junkins, in the guise of the sincere admirer, used his sharp brown 
eyes to look for suspicious dents, flaked paint, maybe a spot of blood or a snarl of matted 
hair. Looking for signs of Moochie Welch. Arnie was suddenly sure that was just what the 
shitter was doing. 'What exactly can I do for you, Detective Junkins?' 
Junkins laughed. 'Man, that's formal! I can't take that! Make it Rudy, okay?' 
'Sure,' Arnie said, smiling. 'What can I do for you, Rudy?' 
'You know, it's funny,' Junkins said, squatting to look at the driver's side headlights. He 
tapped one of them reflectively with his knuckles and then, with seeming absent-mindedness, 
he ran his forefinger along the headlight's semicircular metal hood. His overcoat pooled on 
the oilstained cement floor for a moment; then he stood up. 'We get reports on anything of 
this nature - the trashin of your car, I mean - ' 
'Oh, hey, they didn't really trash it,' Arnie said. He was beginning to feel as if he was on a 
tightrope, and he touched Christine again. Her solidity, her reality, once more seemed to 
comfort him. 'They tried, you know, but they didn't do a very good job.' 
'Okay. I guess I'm not up on the current terminology.' Junkins laughed. 'Anyway, when it 
came to my attention, what do you think I said? “Where's the photographs?” That's what I 
said. I thought it was an oversight, you know. So I called the Libertyville PD and they said 
there were no photographs.' 
'No,' Arnie said. 'A kid my age can't get anything but liability insurance, you know that. 
Even the liability comes with a seven-hundred-dollar deductible. If I had damage insurance, I 
would have taken plenty of pictures. But since I didn't, why would I? I sure wouldn't want 
them for my scrapbook.' 
'No, I guess not,' Junkins said, and walked idly around to the rear of the car, eyes searching 
for broken glass, for scrapes, for guilt. 'But you know what else I thought was funny? You 
didn't even report the crime!' He raised his dark questioning eyes to Arnie's, looked at him 
closely and then smiled a phony, bewildered little smile. 'Didn't even report it! “Huh,” I said. 
“Sonofabitch! Who reported it?” Guy's father, they tell me.' Junkins shook his head. 'I don't 
get that, Arnie, I don't mind telling you. A guy works his ass off restoring an old car until it's 
worth two, maybe five thousand dollars, then some guys come along and beat the hell out of 
it - ' 
'I told you - ' 
Rudy Junkins raised his hand and smiled disarmingly. For one weird second Arnie thought 
he was going to say 'Peace', as Dennis sometimes did when things got heavy. 
'Damaged it. Sorry.' 
'Sure,' Arnie said.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'Anyhow, according to whiat your girlfriend said, one of the perpetrators . . . well, 
defecated on the dashboard. I would have thought you would have been mad as hell. I would 
have thought you would have reported it.' 
Now the smile faded altogether and Junkins looked at Arnie soberly, even sternly. 
Arnie's cool grey eyes met Junkins's brown ones. 
'Shit wipes off,' he said finally. 'You want to know something, Mr - Rudy? You want me to 
tell you something?' 
'Sure, son.' 
'When I was one and a half, I got hold of a fork and marked up an antique bureau that my 
mother had saved up for over a period of maybe five years. Saved up her pin money, that's 
what she said. I guess I racked the hell out of it in a very short time. Of course I don't 
remember it, but she says she just sat right down and bawled.' Arnie smiled a little, 'Up until 
this year, I couldn't feature my mother doing that. Now I think I can. Maybe I'm growing up a 
little, what do you think?' 
Junkins lit a cigarette. 'Am I missing the point, Arnie? Because I don't see it yet.' 
'She said that she would rather have had me in diapers until I was three than have had me 
do that. Because, she said, shit wipes off.' Arnie smiled. 'You flush it away and it's gone.' 
'The way Moochie Welch is gone?' Junkins asked. 
'I know nothing about that.' 
'No?' 
'No.' 
'Scout's honour?' Junkins asked. The question was humorous but the eyes were not; they 
probed at Arnie, looking for the smallest break, a crucial flicker. 
Down the aisle, the fellow who had been putting on his winter snows dropped a tool on the 
concrete. It clanged musically and the fellow chanted, almost chorally, 'Oh shit on you, you 
whore.' 
Junkins and Arnie both glanced that way briefly, and the moment was broken. 
'Sure, Scout's honour,' Arnie said. 'Look, I suppose you have to do this, it's your job - ' 
'Sure its my job,' Junkins agreed softly. 'The boy was run over three times each way. He 
was meat. They scraped him up with a shovel.' 
'Come on,' Arnie said sickly. His stomach did a lazy barrel roll. 
'Why? Isn't that what you're supposed to do with shit? Scrape it up with a shovel?'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'I had nothing to do with it!' Arnie cried, and the man across the way, who had been 
tinkering with his silencer looked up, startled. 
Arnie lowered his voice. 
'I'm sorry. I just wish you'd leave me alone. You know damn well I didn't have anything to 
do with it. You just went over the whole car. If Christine had hit that Welch kid that many 
times and that hard, it would be all busted up. I know that much just from watching TV. And 
when I was taking Auto Shop II two years ago, Mr Smolnack said that the two best ways he 
knew to totally destroy a car's front end was to either hit a deer or a person . He was joking a 
little, but he wasn't kidding. . . if you know what I mean.' Arnie swallowed and heard a click 
in his throat, which was very dry. 
'Sure,' Junkins said. 'Your car looks all right. But you don't, kid. You look like a 
sleepwalker. You look absolutely fucked over. Pardon my French.' He flicked his cigarette 
away. 'You know something, Arnie?' 
'What?' 
'I think you're lying faster than a horse can trot.' He slapped Christine's hood. 'Or maybe I 
should say faster than a Plymouth can run.' 
Arnie looked at him, his hand on the outside mirror on the passenger side. He said nothing. 
'I don't think you're lying about killing the Welch boy. But I think you're lying about what 
they did to your car; your girl said they mashed the crap out of it, and she's a hell of a lot 
more convincing than you are. She cried while she told me. She said there was broken glass 
everywhere . . . Where did you buy replacement glass, by the way?' 
'McConnell's,' Arnie said promptly. 'In the Burg.' 
'Still got the receipt?' 
'Tossed it out.' 
'But they'll remember you. Big order like that.' 
'They might,' Arnie said, 'but I wouldn't count on it, Rudy. They're the biggest auto-glass 
specialists west of New York and east of Chicago. That covers a lot of ground. They do yea 
business, and a lot of it's old cars.' 
'Still, they'll have the paperwork.' 
'I paid cash.' 
'But your name will be on the invoice.' 
'No,' Arnie said, and smiled a wintry smile. 'Darnell's Do-It-Yourself Garage. That way I 
got a ten per cent discount.'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'You got it all covered, don't you?' 
'Lieutenant Junkins - ' 
'You're lying about the glass too, although I'll be goddamned if I know why.' 
'You'd think Christ was lying on Calvary, that's what I think,' Arnie said angrily. 'Since 
when is it a crime to buy replacement glass if someone busts up your windows? Or pay cash? 
Or get a discount?' 
'Since never,' Junkins said. 
'Then leave me be.' 
'More important, I think you're lying about not knowing anything about what happened to 
the Welch boy. You know something. I want to know what.' 
'I don't know anything,' Arnie said. 
'What about - ' 
'I don't have anything more to say to you,' Arnie said. 'I'm sorry.' 
'All right,' Junkins said, giving up so quickly that Arnie was immediately suspicious. He 
rummaged around in the sportcoat he was wearing under his topcoat and took out his wallet. 
Arnie saw that Junkins was carrying a gun in a shoulder holster and suspected Junkins had 
wanted him to see it. He produced a card and gave it to Arnie. 'I can be reached at either of 
those numbers, If you want to talk about anything. Anything at all.' 
Arnie put the card in his breast pocket. 
Junkins took one more leisurely stroll around Christine. 'Hell of a restoration job,' he 
repeated. He looked squarely at Arnie. 'Why didn't you report it?' 
Arnie let out a low shuddering sigh. 'Because I thought that would be the end,' he said. 'I 
thought they'd let off.' 
'Yeah,' Junkins said. 'I thought that might be it. Good night, son.' 
'Good night.' 
Junkins started away, turned, came back. 'Think it over,' he said. 'You really do look like 
hell, you know what I mean? You have a nice girl there. She's worried about you, and she 
feels bad about what happened to your car. Your dad's worried about you, too. I could get 
that even over the phone. Think it over and then give me a call, son. You'll sleep better.' 
Arnie felt something trembling behind his lips, something small and tearful, something that 
hurt. Junkins's brown eyes were kind. He opened his mouth - God alone knew what might 
have spilled out - and then a monstrous jab of pain walloped him in the back, making him</p>
      <p class="calibre3">straighten suddenly. It also had the effect of a slap on a hysteric. He felt calmer, clear-headed 
again. 
'Good night,' he repeated. 'Good night, Rudy.' 
Junkins looked at him a moment longer, troubled, and then left. 
Arnie began to shake all over. The trembling started in his hands and spread up his 
forearms to his elbows, and then it was suddenly everywhere. He grabbed blindly for the 
doorhandle, found it at last, and slipped into Christine, into the comforting smells of car and 
fresh upholstery. He turned the key to ACC, the dash lights glowed, and he felt for the radio 
dial. 
As he did so his eyes fell on the swinging leather tab with R.D.L. branded into it and his 
dream recurred with sudden terrible force: the rotting corpse sitting where he was sitting now; 
the empty eyesockets staring out through the windshield; the fingerbones gripping the wheel; 
the empty grin of the skull's teeth as Christine bore down on Moochie Welch while the radio, 
tuned to WDIL, played 'Last Kiss' by J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers. 
He suddenly felt sick - puking-sick. Nausea fluttered sickeningly in his stomach and in the 
back of his throat. Arnie scrambled out of the car and ran for the head, his footfalls 
hammering crazily in his cars. He just made it. Everything came up; he vomited again and 
again until there was nothing left but sour spit. Lights danced in front of his eyes. His ears 
rang and the muscles in his gut throbbed tiredly. 
He looked at his pale, harried face in the spotty mirror, at the dark circles under his eyes 
and the lank spill of hair across his forehead, Junkins was right. He looked like hell. 
But his pimples were all gone. 
He laughed crazily. He wouldn't give Christine up, no matter what. That was the one thing 
he wouldn't do. He - 
And suddenly he had to do it, again, only there was nothing left to come up: only ripping, 
clenching dry-heaves and that electric taste of spit in his mouth again. 
He had to talk to Leigh. Quite suddenly he had to talk to Leigh. 
* * * * * 
He let himself into Will's office, where the only sound was the thump of the time clock 
bolted on the wall turning up fresh minutes. He dialled the Cabots' number from memory but 
miscued twice because his fingers were trembling so badly. 
Leigh herself answered, her voice sounding sleepy. 
'Arnie?' 
'I have to talk to you, Leigh. I have to see you.'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'Arnie, it's almost ten o'clock. I just got out of the shower and into bed . . . I was almost 
asleep.' 
'Please,' he said, and shut his eyes. 
'Tomorrow,' she said. 'It can't be tonight, my folks wouldn't let me out so late - ' 
'It's only ten. And it's Friday.' 
'They really don't want me to see so much of you Arnie. They liked you at first, and my dad 
still does . . . but they both think you've gotten a little spooky There was a long, long pause at 
Leigh's end. 'I think you have, too,' she said finally. 
'Does that mean you don't want to see me anymore?' he asked dully. His stomach hurt, his 
back hurt, everything hurt. 
'No.' Now the faintest reproach crept into her voice. 'I was kind of getting the idea that you 
didn't want to see me . . . not at school, and nights you're always down there at the garage. 
Working on your car.' 
'That's all done,' he said. And then, with a monstrous effort: 'It's the car I want to - oww, 
goddammit!' He grabbed at his back, where there had been another huge bolt of pain, and got 
only a handful of back brace. 
'Arnie?' She was alarmed. 'Are you all right?' 
'Yeah. I had a twinge in my back.' 
'What were you going to say?' 
'Tomorrow,' he said. 'We'll drive over to Baskin-Robbins and have an ice cream and maybe 
do some Christmas shopping and have some supper and I'll have you home by seven. And I 
won't be weird, I promise.' 
She laughed a little, and Arnie felt a great, sweeping relief. It was like balm. 'You dummy.' 
'Does that mean okay?' 
'Yes, it means okay.' Leigh paused and then said softly, 'I said my parents didn't want me to 
see so much of you. I didn't say I wanted that.' 
'Thanks,' he said, struggling to keep his voice steady. 'Thanks for that.' 
'What do you want to talk to me about?' 
Christine. I want to talk to you about her - and about my dreams. And about why I look like 
hell. And why I always want to listen to WDIL now, and about what I did that night after 
everyone was gone . . . the night I hurt my back. Oh Leigh I want - 
Another slash of pain up his back like cat's claws.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'I think we just talked about it,' he said. 
'Oh.' A slight, warm pause. 'Good.' 
'Leigh?' 
'Umm.' 
'There'll be more time now. I promise. All the time you want.' And thought: Because now, 
with Dennis in the hospital, you're all that's left, all that's left between me . . . me and . . . 
'That's good,' Leigh said. 
'I love you.' 
'Goodbye, Arnie.' 
Say it back! he wanted to shout suddenly. Say it back, I need you to say it back! 
But there was only the click of the phone in his ear. 
He sat behind Will's desk for a long time, head lowered, getting hold of himself. She didn't 
need to say it back every time he said it to her, did she? He didn't need reassurance that badly, 
did he? Did he? 
Arnie got up and went to the door. She was coming out with him tomorrow, that was the 
important thing. They would do the Christmas shopping they had been planning on the day 
those shitters trashed Christine; they would walk and talk; they would have a good time. She 
would say she loved him. 
'She'll say it,' he whispered, standing in the doorway, but halfway down the left-hand side 
of the garage Christine sat like a mute and stupid denial, her grille poking forward as if 
hunting something. 
And the voice whispered out of his lower consciousness, the dark questioning voice: How 
did you hurt your back? How did you hurt your back? How did you hurt your back, Arnie? 
It was a question he shrank from. He was afraid of the answer.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">34   LEIGH AND CHRISTINE 
 
My baby drove up in a brand-new Cadillac,                                                                                   
She said, 'Hey, come here, Daddy,                                                                                                               
I ain't never comin back!'                                                                                                          
Baby, baby, won't you hear my plea?                                                                                             
Come on, sugar, come on back to me!                                                                                                     
She said, 'Balls to you, big daddy,                                                                                           
I ain't never comin back!' 
- The Clash 
 
It was a grey day, threatening snow, but Arnie was right on both counts - they had a good 
time and he wasn't weird. Mrs Cabot had been at home when Arnie got there, and her initial 
reception was cool. But it was a long time - perhaps twenty minutes - before Leigh came 
downstairs, wearing a caramel-coloured sweater that clung lovingly to her breasts and a new 
pair of cranberry-coloured slacks that clung lovingly to her hips. This inexplicable lateness in 
a girl who was almost always perfectly on time might have been on purpose. Arnie asked her 
later and Leigh denied it with an innocence that was perhaps just a little too wide-eyed, but in 
any case it served its purpose. 
Arnie could be charming when he had to be, and he went to work on Mrs Cabot with a will. 
Before Leigh finally came bouncing downstairs, twisting her hair into a ponytail, Mrs Cabot 
had thawed. She had gotten Arnie a Pepsi-Cola and was listening raptly as he regaled her 
with tales of the chess club. 
'It's the only civilized extra-curricular activity I've ever heard of,' she told Leigh, and smiled 
approvingly at Arnie. 
'BORRRRR-ing,' Leigh trumpeted. She put an arm  around Arnie's waist and smacked him 
loudly on the cheek.  
'Leigh Cabot!' 
'Sorry, Mums, but he looks cute in lipstick, doesn't he? Wait a minute, Arnie, I've got a 
Kleenex. Don't claw at it.'  
She dug in her purse for a tissue. Arnie looked at Mrs Cabot and rolled his eyes. Natalie 
Cabot put a hand to her mouth and giggled. The rapprochement between her and Arnie was 
complete. 
Arnie and Leigh went to Baskin-Robbins, where an initial awkwardness, left over from the 
phone conversation of the night before, finally melted away. Arnie had had a vague fear that 
Christine would not run well, or that Leigh would find something nasty to say about her; she</p>
      <p class="calibre3">had never liked riding in his car. Both were needless worries. Christine ran like a fine Swiss 
watch, and the only things Leigh had to say about her rang of pleasure and amazement. 
'I never would have believed it,' she said as they drove out of the ice-cream parlour's small 
parking lot and joined the flow of traffic beaded toward the Monroeville Mall. 'You must 
have worked like a dog.' 
'It wasn't as bad as it probably looked to you,' Arnie said. 'Mind some music?' 
'No, of course not.' 
Arnie turned on the radio - The Silhouettes were kip-kipping and boom-booming through 
'Get a Job.' Leigh made a face. 'DIL, yuck. Can I change it?' 
'Be my guest.' 
Leigh switched it to a Pittsburgh rock station and got Billy Joel. 'You may be right,' Billy 
admitted cheerfully, 'I may be crazy.' This was followed by Billy telling his girl Virginia that 
Catholic girls started much too late - it was the Block Party Weekend. Now, Arnie thought. 
Now she'll start to hitch . . . back off . . . something. But Christine only went rolling along. 
The mall was thronged with hectic but mostly good-natured shoppers; the last frantic and 
sometimes ugly Christmas rush was better than two weeks off. The Yuletide spirit was still 
new enough to be novel, and it was possible to look at the tinsel strung through the wide mall 
hallways without feeling sour and Ebenezer Scroogey. The steady ringing of the Salvation 
Army Santas' bells had not yet become a guilty annoyance; they still chanted good tidings 
and good will rather than the monotonous, metallic chant of The poor have no Christmas the 
poor have no Christmas the poor have no Christmas that Arnie always seemed to hear as the 
day grew closer and both the shopgirls and the Salvation Army Santas grew more harried and 
hollow-eyed. 
They held hands until the parcels grew too many for that, and then Arnie complained 
goodnaturedly about how she was turning him into her beast of burden. As they were going 
down to the lower level and B. Dalton, where Arnie wanted to look for a book on toy-making 
for Dennis Guilder's old man, Leigh noticed that it had begun to snow. They stood for a 
moment at the window of the glassed-in stairwell, looking out like children. Arnie took her 
hand and Leigh looked at him, smiling. He could smell her skin, clean and a bit soapy; he 
could smell the fragrance of her hair. He moved his head forward a bit; she moved hers a bit 
toward him. They kissed lightly and she squeezed his hand. Later, after the bookstore, they 
stood above the rink in the centre of the mall, watching the skaters as they dipped and 
pirouetted and swooped to the sound of Christmas carols. 
It was a very good day right up until the moment that Leigh Cabot almost died. 
* * * * *</p>
      <p class="calibre3">She almost surely would have died, if not for the hitchhiker. They had been on their way 
back then, and an early December twilight had long since turned to snowy dark. Christine, 
surefooted as usual, purred easily through the four inches of fresh light powder. 
Arnie had made a reservation for an early dinner at the British Lion Steak House, 
Libertyville's only really good restaurant, but the time had gotten away from them and they 
had agreed on a quick to-go meal from the McDonald's on JFK Drive. Leigh had promised 
her mother she would be in by eight-thirty because the Cabots were having friends in" and it 
had been quarter of eight when they left the mall. 
'Just as well,' Arnie said. 'I'm damn near broke anyway.' 
The headlights picked out the hitchhiker standing at the intersection of Route 17 and JFK 
Drive, still five miles outside of Libertyville. His black hair was shoulder-length, speckled 
with snow, and there was a duffel-bag between his feet. 
As they approached him, the hitchhiker held up a sign painted with Day-Glo letters It read: 
LIBERTYVILLE, PA. As they drew closer, he flipped it over. The other side read: NON-
PSYCHO COLLEGE STUDENT. 
Leigh burst out laughing. 'Let's give him a ride, Arnie.' Arnie said, 'When they go out of 
their way to advertise their non-psychotic status, that's when you got to look out. But okay.' 
He pulled over. That evening he would have tried to catch the moon in a bushel basket if 
Leigh had asked him to give it a shot. 
Christine rolled smoothly to the verge of the road, tyres barely slipping. But as they 
stopped, static blared across the radio, which had been playing some hard rock tune, and 
when the static cleared, there was the Big Bopper, singing 'Chantilly Lace'. 
'What happened to the Block Party Weekend?' Leigh asked as the hitchhiker ran toward 
them. 
'I don't know,' Arnie said, but he knew. It had happened before. Sometimes all that 
Christine's radio would pick up was WDIL. It didn't matter what buttons you pushed or how 
much you fooled with the FM converter tinder the dashboard; it was WDIL or nothing. 
He suddenly felt that stopping for the hitchhiker had been a mistake. 
But it was too late for second thoughts now; the fellow had opened one of Christine's rear 
doors, tossed his duffel-bag onto the floor, and slipped in after it. A blast of cold air and a 
swirl of snow came in with him. 
'Ah, man, thanks.' He sighed. 'My fingers and toes all took off for Miami Beach about 
twenty minutes ago. They must have gone somewhere, anyway cause I sure can't feel em 
anymore.' 
'Thank my lady,' Arnie said shortly. 
'Thank you, ma'am,' the hitchhiker said, tipping an invisible hat gallantly.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'Don't mention it,' Leigh said, and smiled. 'Merry Christmas.' 
'Same to you,' the hitchhiker said, 'although you'd never know there was such a thing if 
you'd been standing out there trying to hook a ride tonight. People just breeze by and then 
they're gone. Voom.' He looked around appreciatively. 'Nice car, man. Hell of a nice car.' 
'Thanks,' Arnie said. 
'You restore it yourself?' 
'Yeah.' 
Leigh was looking at Arnie, puzzled. His earlier expansive mood had been replaced by a 
curtness that was not like his usual self at all. On the radio, the Big Bopper finished and 
Richie Valens came on, doing 'La Bamba'. 
The hitchhiker shook his head and laughed. 'First the Big Bopper, then Richie Valens. Must 
be death night on the radio. Good old WDIL.' 
'What do you mean?' Leigh asked. 
Arnie snapped the radio off. 'They died in a plane crash. With Buddy Holly.' 
'Oh,' Leigh said in a small voice.   
Perhaps the hitchhiker also sensed the change in Arnie's mood; he fell silent and meditative 
in the back seat. Outside, the snow began to fall faster and harder. The first good storm of the 
season had come in. 
At length, the golden arches twinkled up out of the snow. 
'Do you want me to go in, Arnie?' Leigh asked. Arnie had gone nearly as quiet as stone, 
turning aside her bright attempts at conversation with mere grunts. 
'I will,' he said, and pulled in. 'What do you want?' 'Just a hamburger and french fries, 
please.' She had intended to go the whole hog - Big Mac, shake, even the cookies - but her 
appetite seemed to have shrunk away to nothing. 
Arnie parked. In the yellow light flaring from the squat brick building's undersides, his face 
looked jaundiced and somehow diseased. He turned around, arm trailing over the seat. 'Can I 
grab you something?' 
'No thanks,' the hitchhiker said. 'Folks'll be waiting supper. Can't disappoint my mom. She 
kills the fatted calf every time I come h - ' 
The chunk of door cut off his final word. Arnie had gotten out and was headed briskly 
across to the IN door, his boots kicking up little puffs of new snow. 
'Is he always that cheery?' the hitchhiker asked 'Or does he get sorta taciturn sometimes?'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'He's very sweet,' Leigh said firmly. She was suddenly nervous. Arnie had turned off the 
engine and taken the keys, and she was left alone with this stranger in the back seat. She 
could see him in the rearview mirror, and suddenly his long black hair, tangled by the wind, 
his scruff of beard, and his dark eyes made him seem Manson-like and wild. 
'Where do you go to school?' she asked. Her fingers were plucking at her slacks, and she 
made them stop. 
'Pitt,' the hitchhiker said, and no more. His eyes met hers in the mirror, and Leigh dropped 
hers hastily to her lap. Cranberry red slacks. She had worn them because Arnie had once told 
her he liked them - probably because they were the tightest pair she owned, even tighter than 
her Levi's. She suddenly wished she had worn something else, something that could be 
considered provocative by no stretch of the imagination: a grain-sack, maybe. She tried to 
smile - it was a funny thought, all right, a grain-sack, get it, ha-ha-ho-ho, wotta knee-slapper - 
but no smile came. There was no way she could keep from admitting it to herself: Arnie had 
left her alone with this stranger (as punishment? it had been her idea to pick him up), and 
now she was scared. 
'Bad vibes,' the hitchhiker said suddenly, making her actually catch her breath. His words 
were flat and final. She could see Arnie through the plate-glass window, standing fifth or 
sixth in line. He wouldn't get up to the counter for a while. She found herself imagining the 
hitchhiker suddenly clamping his gloved hands around her throat. Of course she could reach 
the horn-ring . . . but would the horn sound? She found herself doubting it for no sane reason 
at all. She found herself thinking that she could hit the horn ninety-nine times and it would 
honk satisfyingly. But if, on the hundredth, she was being strangled by this hitchhiker on 
whose behalf she had interceded, the horn wouldn't blow. Because . . . because Christine 
didn't like her. In fact, she believed that Christine hated her guts. It was as simple as that. 
Crazy but simple. 
'P-Pardon me?' She glanced back in the rearview mirror and was immeasurably relieved to 
see that the hitchhiker wasn't looking at her at all; he was glancing around the car. He 
touched the seat cover with his palm, then lightly brushed the roof upholstery with the tips of 
his fingers. 
'Bad vibes,' he said, and shook his head. 'This car, I don't know why, but I get bad vibes.' 
'Do you?' she asked, hoping her voice sounded neutral. 
'Yeah. I got stuck in an elevator once when I was a little kid. Ever since then I get attacks of 
claustrophobia. I never had one in a car before, but boy, I got one now. In the worst way. I 
think you could light a kitchen match on my tongue, that's how dry my mouth is.' 
He laughed a short, embarrassed laugh. 
'If I wasn't already so late, I'd just get out and walk. No offence to you or your guy's car,' he 
added hastily, and when Leigh looked back into the mirror his eyes did not seem wild at all, 
only nervous. Apparently he wasn't kidding about the claustrophobia, and he no longer</p>
      <p class="calibre3">looked like Charlie Manson to her at all. Leigh wondered how she could have been so stupid . 
. . except she knew how, and why. She knew perfectly well. 
It was the car. All day long she had felt perfectly okay riding in Christine, but now her 
former nervousness and dislike were back. She had merely projected her feelings onto a 
hitchhiker because . . . well, because you could be scared and nervous about some guy you 
just picked up off the road, but it was insane to be scared by a car, an inanimate construct of 
steel and glass and plastic and chrome. That wasn't just a little eccentric, it was insane. 
'You don't smell anything, do you?' he asked abruptly. 
'Smell anything?' 
'A bad smell.' 
'No, not at all.' Her fingers were plucking at the bottom of her sweater now, pulling off 
wisps of angora. Her heart was knocking unpleasantly in her chest. 'It must be part of your 
claustrophobia whatzis.' 
'I guess so.' 
But she could smell it. Under the good new smells of leather and upholstery there was a 
faint odour: something like gone-over eggs. Just a whiff . . . a lingering whiff. 
'Mind if I crank the window down a little?' 
'If you want,' Leigh said, and found it took some effort to keep her voice steady and casual. 
Suddenly her mind's eye showed her the picture that had been in the paper yesterday 
morning, a picture of Moochie Welch probably culled from the yearbook. The caption 
beneath read: Peter Welch, victim of fatal hit-and-run incident that police feel may have been 
murder. 
The hitchhiker unrolled his window three inches and crisp cold air came in, driving that 
smell away. Inside McD's, Arnie had reached the counter and was giving his order. Looking 
at him, Leigh experienced such an odd swirl of love and fear that she felt nauseated by the 
mixture - for the second or third time lately she found herself wishing that she had fixed on 
Dennis first. Dennis who seemed so safe and sensible. . . . 
She turned her thoughts away from that. 
'Just tell me if it gets cold on you,' the hitchhiker said apologetically. 'I'm weird, I know it.' 
He sighed. 'Sometimes I think I never should have given up drugs, you know?' 
Leigh smiled. 
Arnie came out with a white bag, skidded a little in the snow, and then got behind the 
wheel. 
'Cold like an icebox in here,' he grunted.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'Sorry, man,' the hitchhiker said from the back, and rolled the window up again. Leigh 
waited to see if that smell would come back, but now she could smell nothing but leather, 
upholstery, and the faint aroma of Arnie's aftershave. 
'Here you go, Leigh.' He gave her a burger, fries, and a small Coke. He had gotten himself a 
Big Mac. 
'Want to thank you again for the ride, man,' the hitchhiker said. 'You can just drop me off at 
the corner of JFK and Center, if that's cool.' 
'Fine,' Arnie said shortly, and pulled out. The snow was coming down even more heavily 
now, and the wind had begun to whoop. For the first time Leigh felt Christine skid a bit as 
she felt for a grip on the wide street, which was now almost deserted. They were less than 
fifteen minutes from home. 
With the smell gone, Leigh discovered that her appetite had come back. She wolfed half of 
her hamburger, drank some Coke, and stifled a burp with the back of her hand. The corner of 
Center and JFK, marked with a war memorial, came up on the left, and Arnie pulled over, 
pumping the brakes lightly so Christine wouldn't slide. 
'Have a nice weekend,' Arnie said. He sounded more like his usual self now. Maybe all he 
needed was some food, Leigh thought, amused. 
'Same goes to both of you,' the hitchhiker said. 'And have a merry Christmas.' 
'You too,' Leigh said. She took another bite of her hamburger, chewed, swallowed . . . and 
felt it lodge halfway down her throat. Suddenly she couldn't breathe. 
The hitchhiker was getting out. The noise of the door opening was very loud. The sound of 
the latch clicking sounded like the thud of tumblers falling in a bank-vault. The sound of the 
wind was like a factory whistle. 
(this is stupid I know but I can't Arnie I can't breathe) 
 I'm choking! she tried to say, and what came out was a faint, fuzzy sound that she was sure 
the whine of the wind must have covered. She clawed at her throat and it felt swollen and 
throbbing in her hand. She tried to scream. No breath to scream, no breath 
(Arnie I can't) 
at all, and she could feel it in there., a warm lump of burger and bun. She tried to cough it 
up and it wouldn't come. The dashboard lights, bright green, circular, 
(cat like the eyes of a cat dear God I can't BREATHE) 
watching her - 
(God I can't BREATHE can't BREATHE can't)</p>
