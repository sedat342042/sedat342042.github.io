<p class="calibre3">He stood there, looking at Arnie, waiting for Arnie to say something, but Arnie made no 
reply. He only held LeBay's gaze with his own. His eyes had gone that peculiar slatey colour 
they got when his mind was made up and his feet were planted. LeBay read the look and 
nodded. He looked unhappy and a little ill. 
'Gentlemen, good day.' 
Arnie sighed. 'I guess that's that.' He eyed LeBay's retreating back with some resentment. 
'Yeah,' I said, hoping I sounded more unhappy than I felt. It was the dream. I didn't like the 
idea of Christine back in that garage. It was too much like my dream. 
We started back toward my car, neither of us speaking. LeBay nagged at me. Both LeBays 
nagged at me. I came to a sudden, impulsive decision - God only knows how much different 
things might have been if I hadn't followed the impulse. 
'Hey, man,' I said. 'I gotta go take a whiz. Give me a minute or two, okay?' 
'Sure,' he said, hardly looking up. He walked on, hands in his pockets and eyes on the 
ground. 
I walked off to the left, where a small, discreet sign and an even smaller arrow pointed the 
way toward the restrooms. But when I was over the first rise and out of Arnie's view, I cut to 
the right and started to sprint toward the parking lot. I caught George LeBay slowly folding 
himself behind the wheel of an extremely tiny Chevette with a Hertz sticker on the 
windscreen. 
'Mr LeBay!' I puffed. 'Mr LeBay?' He looked up curiously. 'Pardon me,' I said. 'Sorry to 
bother you again.' 
'That's all right,' he said, 'but I'm afraid what I said to your friend still stands. I can't let him 
garage the car here.' 
'Good,' I said. 
His bushy eyebrows went up. 
'The car,' I said. 'That Fury. I don't like it.' He went on looking at me, not talking. 
'I don't think it's been good for him. Maybe part of it's being . . . I don't know . . . ' 
'Jealous?' he asked me quietly. 'Time he used to spend with you he now spends with her?' 
'Well, yeah, right,' I said. 'He's been my friend for a long time. But I - I don't think that's all 
of it.' 
'No?'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'No.' I looked around to see if Arnie was in sight, and while I wasn't looking at him, I was 
finally able to come out with it. 'Why did you tell him to junk it and forget it? Why did you 
say it was like a bad habit?' 
He said nothing, and I was afraid he had nothing to say - at least, not to me. And then, 
almost too softly to hear, he asked, 'Son, are you sure this is your business?' 
'I don't know.' Suddenly it seemed very important to meet his eyes. 'But I care about Arnie, 
you know. I don't want to see him get hurt. This car has already gotten him into trouble. I 
don't want to see it get any worse.' 
'Come by my motel this evening. It's just off the Western Avenue exit from 376. Can you 
find that?' 
'I hotpatched the sides of the ramp,' I said, and held out my hands. 'Still got the blisters,' 
I smiled, but he didn't smile back. 'Rainbow Motel. There are two at the foot of the exit. 
Mine is the cheap one.' 
'Thanks,' I said awkwardly. 'Listen really, th - ' 
'It may not be your business, or mine, or anyone's,' LeBay said in his soft, schoolteacherish 
voice, so different from (but somehow so eerily similar to) his late brother's wild croak. 
(and that's about the finest smell in the world . . . except maybe for pussy) 
'But I can tell you this much right now. My brother was not a good man. I believe the only 
thing he ever truly loved in his whole life was that Plymouth Fury your friend has purchased. 
So the business may be between them and them alone, no matter what you tell me, or I tell 
you.' 
He smiled at me. It wasn't a pleasant smile, and in that instant I seemed to see Roland D. 
LeBay looking out through his eyes, and I shivered. 
'Son, you're probably too young to look for wisdom in anyone s words but your own, but I'll 
tell you this: love is the enemy.' He nodded at me slowly. 'Yes. The poets continually and 
sometimes wilfully mistake love. Love is the old slaughterer. Love is not blind. Love is a 
cannibal with extremely acute vision. Love is insectile; it is always hungry.' 
'What does it eat?' I asked, not aware I was going to ask anything at all. Every part of me 
but my mouth thought the entire conversation insane. 
'Friendship,' George LeBay said. 'It eats friendship. If I were you, Dennis, I would now 
prepare for the worst.' 
He closed the door of the Chevette with a soft chuck! and started up its sewing-machine 
engine. He drove away, leaving me to stand there on the edge of the blacktop. I suddenly 
remembered that Arnie should see me coming from the direction of the comfort stations, so I 
headed that way as fast as I could.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">As I went it occurred to me that the gravediggers or sextons or eternal engineers or 
whatever they were calling themselves these days would now be lowering LeBay's coffin into 
the earth. The dirt George LeBay had thrown at the end of the ceremony would be splattered 
across the top like a conquering hand. I tried to dismiss the image, but another image, even 
worse, came in its place: Roland D. LeBay inside the silk-lined casket, dressed in his best suit 
and his best underwear - sans smelly, yellowing back brace, of course. 
LeBay was in the ground, LeBay was in his coffin, his hands crossed on his chest . . . and 
why was I so sure that a large, shit-eating grin was on his face?</p>

The Rainbow Motel, was pretty bad, all right. It was one level high, the parking-lot paving 
was cracked, two of the letters in the neon sign were out. It was exactly the sort of place 
you'd expect to find an elderly English teacher. I know how depressing that sounds, but its 
true. And tomorrow he would turn in his Hertz car at- the airport and fly home to Paradise 
Falls, Ohio. 
The Rainbow Motel looked like a geriatric ward. There were old parties sitting outside their 
rooms in the lawnchairs the management supplied for that purpose, their bony knees crossed, 
their white socks pulled up over their hairy shins. The men all looked like aging alpinists, 
skinny and tough. Most of the women were blooming with the soft fat of post-fifty and no 
hope. Since then I've noticed that there are motels which seem filled up with nothing but 
people over fifty - it's like they hear about these places on some Oldies but Goodies Hotline. 
Bring your Hysterectomy and Enlarged Prostate to the Not-So-Scenic Rainbow Motel. No 
Cable TV but We Do Have Magic Fingers, Just a Quarter a Shot. I saw no young people 
outside the units, and off to one side the rusty playground equipment stood empty, the swings 
casting long still shadows on the ground. Overhead, a neon rainbow arced over the sign. It 
buzzed like a swarm of flies caught in a bottle. 
LeBay was sitting outside Unit 14 with a glass in his hand. I went over and shook hands 
with him. 
'Would you like a soft drink?' he asked. 
'No, thanks,' I said. I got one of the lawn-chairs from in front of an empty unit and sat down 
beside him. 
'Then let me tell you what I can,' he said in his soft, cultured voice. 'I am eleven years 
younger than Rollie, and I am still a man who is learning to be old.' 
I shifted awkwardly in my chair and said nothing. 
'There were four of us ' 'he said. 'Rollie was the oldest, I am the youngest. Our brother Drew 
died in France in 1944. He and Rollie were both career Army. We grew up here, in 
Libertyville. Only Libertyville was much, much smaller then, you know, only a village. Small</p>
      <p class="calibre3">enough to have the ins and the outs. We were the outs. Poor folks. Shiftless. Wrong side of 
the tracks. Pick your clich–π.' 
He chuckled softly in the dusk and poured more 7-Up into his glass. 
'I really remember only one constant thing about Rollie's childhood - after all, he was in the 
fifth grade when I was born - but I remember that one thing very well.' 
'What was it?' 
'His anger,' LeBay said. 'Rollie was always angry. He was angry that he had to go to school 
in castoff clothes, he was angry that our father was a drunkard who could not hold a steady 
job in any of the steel mills, he was angry that our mother could not make our father stop 
drinking. He was angry at the three smaller children - Drew, Marcia and myself - who made 
the poverty insurmountable.' 
He held his arm out to me and pushed up the sleeve of his shirt to show me the withered, 
corded tendons of his old man's arm which lay just below the surface of the shiny, stretched 
skin. A scar skidded down from his elbow toward his wrist, where it finally petered out. 
'That was a present from Rollie,' he said. 'I got it when I was three and he was fourteen. I 
was playing with a few painted blocks of wood that were supposed to be cars and trucks on 
the front walk when he slammed out on his way to school. I was in his way, I suppose. He 
pushed me on to the sidewalk, and then he came back and threw me. I landed with my arm 
stuck on one of the pickets of the fence that went around the bunch of weeds and sunflowers 
that my mother insisted on calling 'the garden'. I bled enough to scare all of them into tears -  
all of them except Rollie, who just kept shouting, ‚ÄúYou stay out of my way from now on, you 
goddam snotnose, stay out of my way, you hear?‚Äù' 
I looked at the old scar, fascinated, realizing that it looked like a skid because that small, 
chubby three-year-old's arm had grown over the course of years into the skinny, shiny old 
man's arm I was now looking at. A wound that had been an ugly gouge spilling blood 
everywhere in the year 1921 had slowly elongated into this silvery progression of marks like 
ladder-rungs. The wound had closed, but the scar had . . . spread. 
A terrible, hopeless shudder twisted through me. I thought of Arnie slamming his fists 
down on the dashboard of my car, Arnie crying hoarsely that he would make them eat it, eat 
it, eat it. 
George LeBay was looking at me. I don't know what he saw on my face, but he slowly 
rolled his sleeve back down, and when he buttoned it securely over that scar, it was as if he 
had drawn the curtain on an almost unbearable past. 
He sipped more 7-Up. 
'My father came home that evening -  he had been on one of the toots that he called 
‚Äúhunting up a job‚Äù - and when he heard what Rollie had done, he whaled the tar out of him. 
But Rollie would not recant. He cried, but he would not recant.' LeBay smiled a little. 'At the</p>
      <p class="calibre3">end my mother was terrified, screaming for my father to stop before he killed him. The tears 
were rolling down Rollie's face, and still he would not recant. ‚ÄúHe was in my way,‚Äù Rollie 
said through his tears. ‚ÄúAnd if he gets in my way again I'll do it again, and you can't stop me, 
you damned old tosspot.‚Äù Then my father struck him in the face and made his nose bleed and 
Rollie fell on the floor with the blood squirting through his fingers. My mother was 
screaming, Marcia was crying, Drew was cringing in one corner, and I was bawling my head 
off, holding my bandaged arm. And Rollie went right on saying, ‚ÄúI'd do it again, you tosspot-
tosspot-damned-old-tosspot!‚Äù' 
Above us, the stars had begun to come out. An old woman left a unit down the way, took a 
battered suitcase out of a Ford, and carried it back into her unit. Somewhere a radio was 
playing. It was not tuned to the rock sounds of FM-104. 
'His unending fury is what I remember best,' LeBay repeated softly. 'At school, he fought 
with anyone who made fun of his clothes or the way his hair was cut - he would fight anyone 
he even suspected of making fun. He was suspended again and again. Finally he left and 
joined the Army. 
'It wasn't a good time to be in the Army, the twenties. There was no dignity, no promotion, 
no flying flags and banners. There was no nobility. He went from base to base, first in the 
South and then in the Southwest. We got a letter every three months or so. He was still angry. 
He was angry at what he called ‚Äúthe shitters‚Äù. Everything was the fault of ‚Äúthe shatters‚Äù. The 
shitters wouldn't give him the promotion he deserved, the shatters ha cancelled a furlough, 
the shitters couldn't find their own behinds with both hands and a flashlight. On at least two 
occasions, the shitters put him in the stockade. 
'The Army held on to him because he was an excellent mechanic - he could keep the old 
and decrepit vehicles which were all Congress would allow the Army in some sort of running 
condition.' 
Uneasily, I found myself thinking of Arnie - Arnie who was so clever with his hands. 
LeBay leaned forward. 'But that talent was just another wellspring for his anger, young 
man. And it was an anger that never ended until he bought that car that your friend now 
owns.' 
'What do you mean?' 
LeBay chuckled dryly. 'He fixed Army convoy trucks, Army staff cars, Army weapons-
supply vehicles. He fixed bulldozers and kept staff cars running with spit and baling wire. 
And once, when a visiting Congressman came to visit Fort Arnold in west Texas and had car 
trouble, he was ordered by his commanding officer, who was desperate to make a good 
impression, to fix the Congressman's prized Bentley. Oh, yes, we got a four-page letter about 
that particular ‚Äúshitter‚Äù - a four-page rant of Rollie's anger and vitriol. It was a wonder the 
words didn't smoke the page.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'All those vehicles . . . but Rollie never owned a car himself until after World War II. Even 
then the only thing he was able to afford was an old Chevrolet that ran poorly and was eaten 
up with rust. In the twenties and thirties there was never money enough, and during the war 
years he was too busy trying to stay alive. 
'He was in the motor pool for all those years, and he fixed thousands of vehicles for the 
shitters and never once had one that was all his. It was Libertyville all over again. Even the 
old Chevrolet couldn't assuage that, or the old Hudson Hornet he bought used the year after 
he got married.' 'Married?' 
'Didn't tell you that did 'he?' LeBay said. 'He would have been happy to go on and on about 
his Army experiences - his war experiences and his endless confrontations with the shitters - 
for as long as you and your friend could listen without falling asleep . . . and him with his 
hand in your pocket feeling for your wallet the whole time. But he wouldn't have bothered to 
tell you about Veronica or Rita.' 
'Who were they?' 
'Veronica was his wife,' LeBay said. 'They were married in 1951, shortly before Rollie went 
to Korea. He could have stayed Stateside, you know. He was married, his wife was pregnant, 
he himself was approaching middle age. But he chose to go.' 
LeBay looked reflectively at the dead playground equipment. 
'It was bigamy, you know. By 1951 he was forty-four, and he was married already. He was 
married to the Army. And to the shitters.' 
He fell silent again. His silence had a morbid quality. 
'Are you all right?' I asked finally. 
'Yes,' he said. 'Just thinking. Thinking ill of the dead.' He looked at me calmly - except for 
the eyes; they were dark and wounded. 'You know, all of his hurts me, young man . . . what 
did you say your name was? I don't want to sit here and sing these sad old songs to someone I 
can't call by his first name. Was it Donald?' 
'Dennis,' I said. 'Look, Mr LeBay - ' 
'It hurts more than I would have suspected,' he went on. 'But now that it's begun, let's finish 
it, shall we? I only met Veronica twice. She was from West Virginia. Near Wheeling. She 
was what we then called shirt-tail southern, and she was not terribly bright. Rollie was able to 
dominate her and take her for granted, which was what he seemed to want. But she loved 
him, I think - at least until the rotten business with Rita. As for Rollie, I don't think he really 
married a women at all. He married a kind of . . . of wailing wall. 
'The letters that he sent us . . . well, you must remember that he left school very early. The 
letters, illiterate as they were, represented a tremendous effort for my brother. They were his</p>
      <p class="calibre3">suspension bridge, his novel, his symphony, his greatest effort. I don't think he wrote them to 
get rid of the poison in his heart. I think he wrote them to spread it around. 
Once he had Veronica, the letters stopped. He had his set of eternal ears, and he didn't have 
to bother with us anymore. I suppose he wrote letters to her during the two years he was in 
Korea. I only got one during that period, and I believe Marcia got two. There was no pleasure 
over the birth of his daughter in early 1952, only a surly complaint that there was another 
mouth to feed at home and the shitters took a little more out of him.' 
'Did he never advance in rank?' I asked. The year before I had seen part of a long TV show, 
one of those novels for television called Once an Eagle. I had seen the paperback book in the 
drugstore the next day and had picked it up, hoping for a good war story. As it turned out, I 
got both war and peace, and some new ideas about the armed services. One of them was that 
the old promotion train really gets rolling along in times of war. It was hard for me to 
understand how LeBay could have gone into the service in the early twenties, slogged 
through two wars, and still have been running junk when Ike became President. 
LeBay laughed. 'He was like Prewitt in From Here to Eternity. He would advance, and then 
he would be busted back down for something - insubordination or impertinence or 
drunkenness. I told you he had spent time in the stockade? One of those times was for pissing 
in the punchbowl at the Officers Club at Fort Dix before a party. He only did ten days for that 
offence, because I believe they must have looked into their own hearts and believed it was 
nothing more than a drunken joke, such as some of the officers themselves had probably 
played as fraternity boys - they didn't, they couldn't, have any idea of the hate and deadly 
loathing that lay behind that gesture. But I imagine that by then Veronica could have told 
them.' 
I glanced at my watch. It was quarter past nine. LeBay had been talking for nearly an hour. 
'My brother came home from Korea in 1953 to meet his daughter for the first time. I 
understand he looked her over for a minute or two, then handed her back to his wife, and 
went out to tinker- on his old Chevrolet for the rest of the day . . . getting bored, Dennis?' 
'No,' I said truthfully. 
'All through those years, the one thing that Rollie really wanted was a brand-new car. Not a 
Cadillac or a Lincoln; he didn't want to join the upper class, the officers, the shitters. He 
wanted a new Plymouth or maybe a Ford or a Dodge. 
'Veronica wrote now and then, and she said that they spent most of their Sundays going 
round to car dealerships wherever Rollie was currently stationed. She and the baby would sit 
in the old Hornet Rollie bad and Veronica would read little storybooks to Rita while Rollie 
walked around dusty lot after dusty lot with salesman after salesman, talking about 
compression and horsepower and hemi heads and gear ratios . . . I think, sometimes, of the 
little girl growing up to the background sound of those plastic pennants whipping in the hot 
wind of half a dozen Army tank-towns, and I don't know whether to laugh or cry.'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">My thoughts turned back to Arnie again. 
'Was he obsessed, would you say?' 
'Yes. I would say he was obsessed. He began to give Veronica money to put away. Other 
than his failure to get promoted past Master Sergeant at any point in his career, my brother 
had a problem with drink. He wasn't an alcoholic, but he went on periodic binges every six or 
eight months. What money he had would be gone when the binge was over. He was never 
sure where he spent it. 
'Veronica was supposed to put a stop to that. It was one of the things he married her for. 
When the binges started, Rollie would come to her for the money. He threatened her with a 
knife once; held it to her throat. I got this from my sister, who sometimes talked to Veronica 
on the telephone. Veronica would not give him the money, which at that time, in 1955, 
totalled about eight hundred dollars. ‚ÄúRemember the car, honey,‚Äù she told him, with the point 
of his knife on her throat. ‚ÄúYou'll never get that new car if 'n you booze the money away.‚Äù' 
'She must have loved him, I said. 
'Well, maybe she did. But please don't make the romantic assumption that her love changed 
Rollie in any way. Water can wear away stone, but only over hundreds of years. People are 
mortal.' 
He seemed to debate saying something else along that line and then to decide against it. The 
lapse struck me as peculiar. 
'But he never put a mark on either of them,' he said. 'And you must remember that he was 
drunk on the occasion when he held the knife to her throat. There is a great outcry about 
drugs in the schools now, and I don't oppose that outcry because I think it's obscene to think 
of children fifteen and sixteen years old reeling around full of dope, but I still believe alcohol 
is the most vulgar, dangerous drug ever invented - and it is legal. 
'When my brother finally left the Army in l957,Veronica had put away a little over twelve 
hundred dollars, Adding to it was a substantial disability pension for his back injury - he 
fought the shitters for it and won, he said. 
'So the money was finally there. They got the house you and your friend visited, but before 
the house was even considered, of course, the car came. The car was always paramount. The 
visits to the car dealerships reached a fever pitch. And at last he settled upon Christine. I got a 
long letter about her. She was a 1958 Fury sport coups, and he gave me all the facts and 
figures in his letter. I don't remember them, but I bet your friend could cite her vital statistics 
chapter and verse.' 
'Her measurements,' I said. 
LeBay smiled humourlessly. 'Her measurements, yes. I do remember that he wrote her 
sticker price was just a tad under $3000, but he ‚Äújewed em down‚Äù, as he put it, to $2100 with</p>
      <p class="calibre3">the trade-in. He ordered her, paid ten per cent down, and when she came, he paid the balance 
in cash - ten- and twenty-dollar bills. 
'The next year, Rita, who was then six, choked to death.' 
I jumped in my chair and almost knocked it over. His soft, teacherish voice had a lulling 
quality, and I was tired; I had been half-asleep. That last had been like a dash of cold water in 
my face. 
'Yes, that's right,' he said to my questioning, startled glance. 'They had been out 
‚Äúmotorvating‚Äù for the day. That was what replaced the car-hunting expeditions. 'Motorvating'. 
That was his word for it. He got that from one of those rock and roll songs he was always 
listening to. Every Sunday the three of them would go out 'motorvating'. There were 
litterbags in the front and the back. The little girl was forbidden to drop anything on the floor, 
She was forbidden to make any messes. She knew that lesson well. She . . . ' 
He fell into that peculiar, thinking silence again and then came back on a new tack. 
'Rollie kept the ashtrays clean. Always. He was a heavy smoker, but he'd poke his cigarette 
out the wing window instead of tapping it into the ashtray, and when he was done with a 
cigarette, he'd snuff it and toss it out the window. If he had someone with him who did use 
the ashtray, he'd dump the ashtray and then wipe it out with a paper towel when the drive was 
over. He washed her twice a week and Simonized her twice a year. He serviced her himself, 
buying time at a local garage.' 
I wondered if it had been Damell's. 
'On that particular Sunday, they stopped at a roadside stand for hamburgers on the way 
home - there were no McDonald's in those days, you know, just roadside stands. And what 
happened was . . . simple enough, I suppose . . . ' 
That silence again, as if he wondered just how much he should tell me, or how to separate 
what he knew from his speculations. 
'She choked to death on a piece of meat,' he said finally. 'When she started to gag and put 
her hands to her throat, Rollie pulled over, dragged her out of the car, and thudded her on the 
back, trying to bring it up. Of course now they had a method - the Heimlich Manoeuvre - that 
works rather well in situations like that. A young girl, a student teacher, actually, saved a boy 
who was choking in the cafeteria at my school just last year by employing the Heimlich 
Manoeuvre. But in those days . . . 
'My niece died by the side of the road. I imagine it was a filthy, frightening way to die.' 
His voice had resumed that sleepy schoolroom cadence, but I no longer felt sleepy. Not at 
all. 
'He tried to save her. I believe that. And I try to believe that it was only ill luck that she 
died. He had been in a ruthless business for a long time, and I don't believe he loved his</p>
      <p class="calibre3">daughter very deeply, if at all. But sometimes, in mortal matters, a lack of love can be a 
saving grace. Sometimes ruthlessness is what is required.' 
'But not this time,' I said. 
'In the end he turned her over and held her by her ankles. He punched her in the belly, 
hoping to make her vomit. I believe he would have tried to do a tracheotomy on her with his 
pocket-knife if he had even the slightest idea of how to go about it. But of course he did not. 
She died. 
'Marcia and her husband and family came to the funeral. So did I. It was our last family 
reunion. I remember thinking, He will have traded the car, of course. In an odd way, I was a 
little disappointed. It had figured so largely in Veronica's letters and the few which Rollie 
wrote that I felt it was almost a member of their family. But he hadn't. They pulled up to the 
Libertyville Methodist Church in it, and it was polished . . . and shining . . . and hateful. It 
was hateful.' He turned to look at me. 'Do you believe that, Dennis?' 
I had to swallow before I could answer. 'Yes,' I said. 'I believe it.' 
LeBay nodded grimly. 'Veronica was sitting in the passenger seat like a wax dummy. 
Whatever she had been whatever there was inside her - was gone. Rollie had had the car, she 
had had the daughter. She didn't just grieve. She died.' 
I sat there and tried to imagine it - tried to imagine what I would have done it if had been 
me. My daughter starts to choke and strangle in the back seat of my car and then dies by the 
side of the road. Would I trade the car away? Why'? It wasn't the car that killed her; it was 
whatever she strangled on, the bit of hamburger and bun that had blocked her windpipe. So 
why trade the car? Other than the small fact that I wouldn't even be able to look at it, wouldn't 
even be able to think of it, without horror and sorrow. Would I trade it? Man, does a bear shit 
in the woods? 
'Did you ask him about it?' 
'I asked him, all right. Marcia was with me. it was after the service. Veronica's brother had 
come up from Glory, West Virginia, and he took her back to the house after the graveside 
ceremony - she was in a kind of walking swoon, anyway. 
'We got him alone, Marcia and I. That was the real reunion. I asked him if he intended to 
trade the car. It was parked directly behind the hearse that had brought his daughter to the 
cemetery - the same cemetery where Rollie himself was buried today you know. It was red 
and white - Chrysler never offered the 1958 Plymouth Fury in those colours; Rollie had 
gotten it custom-painted. We were standing about fifty feet away from it, and I had the 
strangest feeling . . . the strangest urge . . . to move yet farther away, as if it could hear us.' 
'What did you say?' 
'I asked him if he was going to trade the car. That hard, mulish look came onto his face, that 
look I remember so well from my early childhood. It was the look that had been on his face</p>
      <p class="calibre3">when he threw me onto the picket fence. The look that was on his face when he kept calling 
my father a tosspot, even after my father made his nose bleed. He said, ‚ÄúI'd be crazy to trade 
her, George, she's only a year old and she's only got 11,000 miles on her. You know you 
never get your money out of a trade until a car's three years old.‚Äù 
'I said, ‚ÄúIf this is a matter of money to you, Rollie, someone stole what was left of your 
heart and replaced it with a piece of stone. Do you want your wife looking at it every day? 
Riding in it? Good God, man!‚Äù 
'That look never changed. Not until he looked at the car, sitting there in the sunlight . . . 
sitting there behind the hearse. That was the only time his face softened. I remember 
wondering if he'd ever looked at Rita that way. I don't suppose he ever did. I don't think it 
was in him.' 
He fell silent for a moment and then went on. 
'Marcia told him all the same things. She was always afraid of Rollie, but that day she was 
more mad than afraid - she had gotten Veronica's letters, remember, and she knew how much 
Veronica loved her little girl. She told him that when someone dies, you burn the mattress 
they slept on, you give their clothes to the Salvation Army, whatever, you put finish to the 
life any way you can so that the living can get on with their business. She told him that his 
wife was never going to be able to get on with her business as long as the car where her 
daughter died was still in the garage. 
'Rollie asked her in that ugly, sarcastic way he had if she wanted him to douse his car with 
gasoline and touch a match to her just because his daughter had choked to death. My sister 
started to cry and told him she thought that was a fine idea. Finally I took her by the arm and 
led her away. There was no talking to Rollie, then or ever. The car was his, and he could talk 
on and on about keeping a car three years before you trade it, he could talk about mileage 
until he was blue in the face, but the simple fact was, he was going to keep her because he 
wanted to keep her. 
'Marcia and her family went back to Denver on a Greyhound, and so far as I know, she 
never saw Rollie again or even wrote him a note. She didn't come to Veronica's funeral.' 
His wife. First the kid, and then the wife. I knew, somehow that it had been just like that. 
Bang-bang. A kind of numbness crept up my legs to the pit of my stomach. 
'She died six months later. In January of 1959.' 
'But nothing to do with the car,' I said. 'Nothing to do with the car, right?' 
'It had everything to do with the car,' he said softly. 
I don't want to hear it, I thought  But of course I would hear it. Because my friend owned 
that car now, and because it had become something that had grown out of all proportion to 
what it should have been in his life.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'After Rita died, Veronica went into a depression. She simply never came out of it. She had 
made some friends in Libertyville, and they tried to help her . . . help her find her way again, 
I guess one would say. But she was not able to find her way. Not at all. 
'Otherwise, things were fine. For the first time in my brother's life, there was plenty of 
money. He had his Army pension, his disability pension, and he had gotten a job as a night 
watchman at the tyre factory over on the west side of town. I drove over there after the 
funeral, but it's gone.' 
'It went broke twelve years ago,' I said. 'I was just a kid, There's a Chinese fast-food place 
there now.' 
'They were paying off the mortgage at the rate of two payments a month. And, of course, 
they had no little girl to take care of any longer. But for Veronica, there was never any light 
or impulse toward recovery. 
'She went about committing suicide quite coldbloodedly, from all that I have been able to 
find out. If there were textbooks for aspiring suicides, her own might be included as an 
example to emulate. She went down to the Western Auto store here in town - the same one 
where I got my first bicycle many many years ago - and bought twenty feet of rubber hose. 
She fitted one end over Christine's exhaust pipe and put the other end in one of the back 
windows. She had never gotten a driver's licence, but she knew how to start the car. That was 
really all she needed to know.' 
I pursed my lips, wet them with my tongue, and heard my voice, little more than a rusty 
croak. 'I think I'll get that soda now.' 
'Perhaps you'd be good enough to get me another,' he said. 'It will keep me awake - they 
always do - but I suspect I'd be awake most of tonight anyway.' 
I suspected I would be, too. I went to get the sodas in the motel office, and on my way back 
I stopped halfway across the parking lot. He was only a deeper shadow in front of his motel 
unit, his white socks glimmering like small ghosts. I thought, Maybe the car is cursed. Maybe 
that's what it is. It sounds like a ghost story, all right. There's a signpost up ahead . . . next 
stop, the Twilight Zone! 
But that was ridiculous, wasn't it? 
Of course it was. I went on walking again Cars didn't carry curses any more than people 
carried them; that was horror-movie stuff, sort of amusing for a Saturday night at the drive-in, 
but very, very far from the day-to-day facts that make up reality. 
I gave him his can of soda and heard the rest of his story, which could be summed up in one 
line: He lived unhappily ever after. The one and only Roland D. LeBay had kept his small 
tract house, and he had kept his 1958 Plymouth. In 1965 he had hung up his night watchman's 
cap and his check-in clock. And somewhere around that same time he had stopped his</p>
      <p class="calibre3">painstaking efforts to keep Christine looking and running like new - he had let her run down 
the way a man might let a watch run down. 
'You mean it just sat but there?' I asked. 'Since 1965? For thirteen years?' 
'No, he put it in the garage, of course,' LeBay said. 'The neighbours would never have stood 
for a car just mouldering away out on someone's lawn. In the country, maybe, but not in 
Suburbia, USA.' 
'But it was out there when we - ' 
'Yes, I know. He put it out on the lawn with a FOR SALE sign in the window. I asked 
about that. I was curious, and so I asked. At the Legion. Most of them had lost touch with 
Rollie, but one of them said he thought he'd seen the car out there on the lawn for the first 
time this May.' 
I started to say something and then fell silent. A terrible idea had come to me, and that idea 
was simply this: It was too convenient. Much too convenient. Christine had sat in that dark 
garage for years - four, eight, a dozen, more. Then - a few months before Arnie and I came 
alone and Arnie saw it - Roland LeBay had suddenly hauled it out and stuck a FOR SALE 
sign on it. 
Later on - much later - I checked back through issues of the Pittsburgh papers and the 
Libertyville paper, the Keystone. He had never advertised the Fury, at least not in the papers, 
where you usually hawk a car you want to sell. He just put it out on his suburan street - not 
even a thoroughfore - and waited for a buyer to come along. 
I did not completely realize the rest of the thought then - not in any logical, intellectual 
way, at least - but I had enough of it to feel a recurrence of that cold, blue feeling of fright. It 
was as if he knew a buyer would be coming. If not in May, then in June. Or July. Or August. 
Sometime soon. 
No, I didn't get this idea logically or rationally. What came instead was a wholly visceral 
image: a Venus-Flytrap at the edge of a swamp, its green jaws wide open, waiting for an 
insect to land. 
The right insect. 
'I remembering thinking he must have given it up because he didn't want to take a chance of 
flunking the driver's exam,' I said finally. 'After you get so old, they make you take one every 
year or two. The renewal s stops being automatic.' 
George LeBay nodded. 'That sounds like Rollie,' he said. 'But . . . ' 
'But what?' 
'I remember reading somewhere - and I can't remember who said it, or wrote it, for the life 
of me - that there are ‚Äútimes‚Äù in human existence. That when it came to be steam-engine</p>
      <p class="calibre3">time‚Äú, a dozen men invented steam engines. Maybe only one man got the patent, or the credit 
in the history books, but all at once there they were, all those people working on that one 
idea. How do you explain it? Just that it's steam-engine time.' 
LeBay took a drink of his soda and looked up at the sky. 
'Comes the Civil War and all at once it's ‚Äùironclad time‚Äú. Then it's ‚Äùmachine-gun time‚Äú. 
Next thing you know it's ‚Äùelectricity time‚Äú and ‚Äùwireless time‚Äú and finally it's atom-bomb 
time‚Äù. As if those ideas all come not from individuals but from some great wave of 
intelligence that always keeps flowing . . . some wave of intelligence that is outside of 
humanity.' 
He looked at me. 
'That idea scares me if I think about it too much, Dennis. There seems to be something . . . 
well, decidedly unchristian about it.' 
'And for your brother there was ‚Äúsell Christine time‚Äù?' 
'Perhaps. Ecclesiastes says there's a season for everything - a time to sow, a time to reap, a 
time for war, a time for peace, a time to put away the sling, and a time to gather stones 
together. A negative for every positive. So if there was ‚ÄúChristine time‚Äù in Rollie's life, there 
might have come a time for him to put Christine away as well. 
'If so, he would have known it. He was an animal, and animals listen very well to their 
instincts. 
'Or maybe he finally just tired of it,' LeBav finished. 
I nodded that that might be it, mostly because I was anxious to be gone, not because that 
explained it to my complete satisfaction. George LeBay hadn't seen that car on the day Arnie 
had yelled at me go back. I had seen it though. The '58 hadn't looked like a car that had been 
resting peacefully in a garage. It had been dirty and dented, the windscreen cracked, one 
bumper mostly torn away. It had looked like a corpse that had been disinterred and left to 
decay in the sun. 
I thought of Veronica LeBay and shivered. 
As if reading my thoughts - part of them, anyway LeBay said, 'I knew very little about how 
my brother may have lived or felt during the last years of his life, but I'm quite sure of one 
thing, Dennis. When he felt, in 1965 or whenever it was, that it was time to put the car away, 
he put it away. And when he felt it was time to put it up for sale, he put it up for sale.' 
He paused. 
'And I don't think I have anything else to tell you except that I really believe your friend 
would be happier if he got rid of that car. I looked at him closely, your friend. He didn't look 
like a particularly happy young man at the present. Am I wrong about that?'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">I considered his question carefully. No, happiness wasn't exactly Amie's thing, and never 
had been. But until the thing had begun with the Plymouth, he had seemed at least content as 
if he had reached a modus vivendi with life. Not a completely happy one, but at least a 
workable one. 
'No,' I said. 'You're not wrong.' 
'I don't believe my brother's car will make him happy. If anything, just the opposite.' And as 
if he had just read my thoughts of a few minutes before, he went on: 'I don't believe in curses, 
you know. Nor in ghosts or anything precisely supernatural. But I do believe that emotions 
and events have a certain . . . lingering resonance. It may be that emotions can even 
communicate themselves in certain circumstances, if the circumstances are peculiar enough . 
. . the way a carton of milk will take the flavour of certain strongly spiced foods if it's left 
open in the refrigerator. Or perhaps that's only a ridiculous fancy on my part, Possibly it's just 
that I would feel better knowing the car my niece choked in and my sister-in-law killed 
herself in had been pressed down into a cube of meaningless metal. Perhaps all I feel is a 
sense of outraged propriety.' 
'Mr LeBay, you said you'd hired someone to take care of your brother's house until it was 
sold. Was that true?' 
He shifted a little in his chair. 'No, it wasn't. I lied on impulse. I didn't like the thought of 
that car back in that garage . . . as if it had found its way home. If there are emotions and 
feelings that still live on, they would be there, as well as in the car herself.' And very quickly 
he corrected himself: 'Itself.' 
* * * * * 
Not long after, I said my goodbyes and followed my headlights home through the dark, 
thinking over everything LeBay had told me. I wondered if it would make any difference to 
Arnie if I told him one person had had a mortal accident in his car and another had actually 
died in it. I pretty well knew that it wouldn't; in his own way, Arnie could be every bit as 
stubborn as Roland LeBay himself. The lovely little scene over the car with his parents had 
shown that quite conclusively. The fact that he went on taking auto-shop courses down there 
in the Libertyville High version of the DMZ showed the same thing. 
I thought of LeBay saying, I didn't like the thought of that car back in that garage . . . as if 
it had found its way home. 
He had also said that his brother took the car someplace to work on it. And the only do-it-
yourself garage in Libertyville now was Will Darnell's. Of course, there might have been 
another back in the '50s, but I didn't believe it. In my heart what I believed was that Arnie had 
been working on Christine in a place where she had been worked on before. 
Had been. That was the operant phrase . Because of the fight with Buddy Repperton, Arnie 
was afraid to leave it there any longer, So maybe that avenue to Christine's past was blocked 
off as well.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">And, of course, there were no curses. Even LeBay's idea about lingering emotions was 
pretty farfetched. I doubted if he really believed it himself. He had shown me an old scar, and 
he had used the word vengeance. And that was probably a lot closer to the truth than any 
phony supernatural bullshit. Of course. 
No; I was seventeen years old, bound for college in another year, and I didn't believe in 
such things as curses and emotions that linger and grow rancid, the spilled milk of dreams. I 
would not have granted you the power of the past to reach out horrid dead hands toward the 
living. 
But I'm a little older now.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">13   LATER THAT EVENING 
 
As I was motorvating over the hill                                                                                                                   
I saw Maybelline in a Coupe de Ville.                                                                                                              
Cadillac rollin down the open road                                                                                                           
But nothin outrun my V8 Ford . . .  
                                - Chuck Berry 
 
My mother and Elaine had gone to bid, but my dad was up, watching the eleven o'clock 
news on TV. 'Where you been, Dennis?' he asked. 
'Bowling,' I said, the lie coming naturally and instinctively to my lips. I didn't want my 
father to know any of this. Peculiar as it was, it really wasn't peculiar enough to be more than 
moderately interesting. Or so I rationalized. 
'Arnie called,' he said. 'Asked me to have you call back if you got in before eleven-thirty or 
so.' 
I glanced at my watch. It was only eleven-twenty. But hadn't I had enough of Arnie and 
Arnie's problems for one day? 
'Well?' 
'Well what?' 
'Are you going to call him?' 
I sighed. 'Yeah, I guess I will.' 
I went into the kitchen, slapped together a cold chicken sandwich, poured myself a glass of 
Hawaiian punch - gross stuff, but I love it - and dialled Arnie's house. He picked up the 
phone himself on the second ring. He sounded happy and excited. 
'Dennis! Where you been?' 
'Bowling,' I said. 
'Listen, I went down to Darnell's tonight, you know? And - this is great, Dennis - he gave 
Repperton the boot! Repperton's gone and I can stay!' 
That sensation of unformed dread in my belly again. I put my sandwich down. Suddenly I 
didn't want it anymore. 
'Arnie, do you think taking it back there is really such a good idea?'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">What do you mean? Repperton's gone. That doesn't sound like a good idea to you?' 
I thought about Darnell ordering Arnie to turn off his car before it polluted his cruddy 
garage, Darnell telling Arnie he didn't take any shit from kids like him. I thought about the 
shamefaced way Arnie had cut his eyes away from mine when he told me he had gotten lift-
time to change his oil by doing 'a couple of errands'. I had an idea that Darnell might find it 
amusing to turn Arnie into his pet gofer. It would amuse the shit out of his other regulars and 
his poker buddies. Arnie goes out for coffee, Arnie goes out for doughnuts, Arnie changes the 
toilet paper rolls in the crapper and loads up the Nibroc dispenser with paper towels. Hey 
Will, who's the four eyes swamping out the toilet in there? . . . Him? Name's Cunningham. 
His folks teach up at the college. He's taking a shithouse postgrad course down here. And 
they would laugh. Arnie would the local joke down at Darnell's Garage on Hampton Street. 
I thought about those things, but I didn't say them. I figured Arnie could make up his own 
mind about whether he was treading water or shit. This couldn't go on for ever Arnie was just 
too smart. Or so I hoped. He was ugly, but he wasn't dumb. 
'Repperton being gone sounds like a fine idea,' I said. 'It was just that I thought Darnell's 
was sort of a temporary measure. I mean, twenty a week, Arnie that's pretty stiff on top of the 
tools fees and the lift fees and all that happy crappy.' 
'That's why I thought renting Mr LeBay's garage would be so great,' Arnie said. 'I figured 
that even at twenty-five a week I'd be better off.' 
'Well, there you go. It you put an ad in the paper for garage space, I bet you'd - ' 
'No, no, let me finish,' Arnie said. He was still excited. 'When I went down there this 
afternoon Darnell took me aside right away. Said he was sorry about the ragging I had to take 
from Repperton. He said he misjudged me.' 
'He said that?' I guess I believed it, but I didn't trust it. 
'Yeah. He asked me how I'd like to work for him part-time. Ten, maybe twenty hours a 
week during school. Putting stuff away, oiling the lifts, that kind of thing. And I can have the 
space for ten a week, tools fees and lift fees at half. How does that sound?' 
I thought it sounded too fucking good to be true. 
'Watch your ass, Arnie.' 
'What?' 
'My dad says he's a crook.' 
'I haven't seen any sign of it, I think that's all just talk, Dennis. He's a loudmouth, but I think 
that's all.'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">I'm just telling you to stay loose, that's all.' I switched the phone to my other ear and drank 
some Hawaiian Punch. 'Keep your eyes open and move away quick if anything starts to look 
heavy.' 
'Are you talking about anything specific?' 
I thought of the vague stories about drugs, the more specific ones about hot cars. 
'No,' I said. 'I just don't trust him.' 
'Well . . . he said doubtfully, trailing away, and then came back to the original subject: 
Christine. With him it always got back to Christine. 'But it's a break, a real break for me, 
Dennis, if it works out. Christine . . . she's really hurting. I've been able to do some things 
with her, but for everything I do it looks like there's four more. Some of it I don't even know 
how to do, but I'm going to learn.' 
'Yeah,' I said, and took a bite out of my sandwich. After my conversation with George 
LeBay, my enthusiasm for the subject of Arnie's best girl Christine had passed zero and 
entered the negative regions. 
'She needs a front-end alignment - hell, she needs a new front end - and new brake shoes . . 
. a ring-job . . . I may try to re-grind the pistons . . . but I can't do any of that stuff with my 
fifty-four-buck Craftsman toolkit. You see what I mean, Dennis?' 
He sounded like he was pleading for my approval. With a sinking in my stomach, I 
suddenly remembered a guy we had gone to school with. Freddy Darlington, his name had 
been. Freddy was no ball of fire, but he was an okay kid with a good sense of humour. Then 
he met some slut from Penn Hills - and I mean a real slut, one more than happy to stoop for 
the troops, bang for the gang, pick your pejorative. She had a mean, stupid face that reminded 
me of the back end of a Mack truck and she never stopped chewing gum. The stink of Juicy 
Fruit hung around her in a constant cloud. She got pregnant at about the same time Freddy 
got hung up on her. I always sort of figured he got hung up on her because she was the first 
girl to let him go all the way. So what happens is he drops out of school, gets a job in a 
warehouse, the princess has the baby, and he shows up with her at a party after the Junior 
Prom last December, wanting everything to seem the same when nothing is the same; she is 
looking at all of us guys with those dead, contemptuous eyes, her jaws are going up and down 
like the jaws of a cow working over a particularly tasty cud, and all of us have heard the 
news: she's back at the bowling alley, she's back at the Libertyville Rec, she's back at Gino's, 
she's out cruising while Freddy is working, she's back hard at work, banging for the gang and 
stooping for the troops. I know they say that a stiff dick has no conscience, but I tell you now 
that some cunts have teeth, and when I looked at Freddy, looking ten years older than he 
should have, I felt like I wanted to cry. And when he talked about her, he did it in that same 
pleading tone I had heard in Arnie's voice just now - You really like her, guys, don't you? 
She's all right, isn't she, guys? I didn't fuck up too bad, did I, guys? I mean, this is probably 
just a bad dream and I'll wake up pretty soon, right? Right? Right?</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'Sure,' I said into the telephone. That whole stupid, ugly Freddy Darlington business had 
gone through my mind in maybe two seconds. 'I see what you mean, Arnie.' 
'Good,' he said, relieved. 
'Just watch out for your ass. And that goes double when you get back to school. Keep away 
from Buddy Repperton.' 
'Yeah. You bet.' 
'Arnie - ' 
'What?' 
I paused. I wanted to ask him if Darnell had said anything about Christine being in his shop 
before, if he had recognized her. Even more, I wanted to tell him what had happened to Mrs 
LeBay and to her small daughter, Rita. But I couldn't. He would know right away where I had 
gotten the information. And in his touchy state over the damn car, he would be apt to think I 
had gone behind his back - and in a way I had. But to tell him I had might well mean the end 
of our friendship. 
I had had enough of Christine, but I still cared for Arnie. Which meant that door had to be 
closed for good. No more creeping around and asking questions. No more lectures. 
'Nothing,' I said. 'I was just going to say that I guess you found a home for your rustbucket. 
Congratulations.' 
'Dennis, are you eating something?' 
'Yeah, a chicken sandwich. Why?' 
'You're chewing in my ear. It really sounds gross.' 
I began to smack as loudly as I could. Arnie made puking sounds. We both got laughing, 
and it was good - it was like the old days before he married that numb fucking car. 
'You're an asshole, Dennis.' 
'That's right. I learned it from you. 
'Get bent,' he said, and hung up. 
* * * * * 
I finished my sandwich and my Hawaiian Punch, rinsed the plate and the glass and went 
back into the living room, ready to shower and go to bed. I was beat. 
Sometime during our phone conversation I had heard the TV go off and had assumed that 
my father had gone upstairs. But he hadn't. He was sitting in his recliner chair with his shirt 
open. I noticed with some unease how grey the hair on his chest was getting, and the way the</p>
      <p class="calibre3">reading lamp beside him shone through the -hair on his head and showed his pink scalp. 
Getting thinner up there. My father was no kid. I realized with greater unease that in five 
years, by the time I would theoretically finish college, he would be fifty and balding - a 
stereotype accountant. Fifty in five years if he didn't just drop dead of another heart attack. 
The first one had not been bad - no myocardial scarring, he had told me on the one occasion I 
had asked. But he did not try to tell me that a second heart attack wasn't likely. I knew it was, 
my mom knew it was, and he did too. Only Ellie still thought he was invulnerable - but hadn't 
I seen a question in her eyes once or twice? I thought maybe I had. 
Died suddenly. 
I felt the hairs on my scalp stir. Suddenly. Straightening up at his desk, clutching his chest. 
Suddenly. Dropping his racket on the tennis court. You didn't want to think those thoughts 
about your father, but sometimes they come. God knows they do. 
'I couldn't help overhearing some of that,' he said. 
'Yeah?' Warily. 
'Has Arnie Cunningham got his foot in a bucket of something warm and brown, Dennis?' 
'I . . . I don't know for sure,' I said slowly. Because, after all, what did I have? Vapours, that 
was all. 
'You want to talk about it?' 
'Not right now, Dad, if it's okay.' 
'It's fine,' he said. 'But if it . . . as you said on the phone, if it gets heavy, will you for God's 
sake tell me what's happening?' 
'Yes.' 
'Okay.' I started for the Stairs and was almost there when he stopped me by saying, 'I ran 
Will Darnell's accounts and did his income-tax returns for almost fifteen years, you know.' 
I turned back to him, really surprised. 
'No. I didn't know that.' 
My father smiled. It was a smile I had never seen before, one I would guess my mother had 
seen only a few times, my sis maybe not at all. You might have thought it was a sleepy sort of 
smile at first, if you looked more closely you would have seen that it was not sleepy at all - it 
was cynical and hard and totally aware. 
'Can you keep your mouth shut about something, Dennis?' 
'Yes,' I said. 'I think so.' 
'Don't just think so.'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'Yes. I can.' 
'Better. I did his figures up until 1975, and then he got Bill Upshaw over in Monroeville.' 
My father looked at me closely. 
'I won't say that Bill Upshaw is a crook, but I will say that his scruples are thin enough to 
read a newspaper through. And last year he bought himself a $300,000 English Tudor in 
Sewickley, Damn the interest rates, full speed ahead.' 
He gestured at our own home with a small sweep of his right arm and then let it drop back 
into his own lap. He and my mother had bought it the year before I was born for $62,000 - it 
was now worth maybe $150,000 - and they had only recently gotten their paper back from the 
bank. We had a little party in the back yard late last summer; Dad lit the barbecue, put the 
pink slip on the long fork, and each of us got a chance at holding it over the coals until it was 
gone. 
'No English Tudor here, huh, Denny?' he said. 
'It's fine,' I said. I came back and sat down on the couch. 
'Darnell and I parted amicably enough,' my father went on, 'not that I ever cared very much 
for him in a personal way. I thought he was a wretch.' 
I nodded a little, because I liked that; it expressed my gut feelings about Will Darnell better 
than any profanity could. 
'But there's all the difference in the world between a personal relationship and a business 
relationship. You learn that very quickly in this business, or you give it up and start selling 
Fuller Brushes door-to-door. Our business relationship was good, as far as it went . . . but it 
didn't go far enough. That was why I finally called it quits.' 
'I don't get you.' 
'Cash kept showing up,' he said. 'Large amounts of cash with no clear ancestry. At Darnell's 
direction I invested in two corporations - Pennsylvania Solar Heating and New York 
Ticketing - that sounded like two of the dummiest dummy corporations I've ever heard of. 
Finally I went to see him, because I wanted all my cards on the table. I told him that my 
professional opinion was that, if he got audited either by the IRS or by the Commonwealth of 
Pennsylvania tax boys, he was apt to have a great deal of explaining to do, and that before 
long I was going to know too much to be an asset to him.' 
'What did he say?' 
'He began to dance,' my father said, still wearing that sleepy, cynical smile. 'In my business, 
you start to get familiar with the steps of the dance by the time you're thirty-eight or so . . . if 
you're good at your business, that is. And I'm not all that bad, The dance starts off with the 
guy asking you if you're happy with your work, if it's paying you enough. If you say you like</p>
      <p class="calibre3">the work but you sure could be doing better, the guy encourages you to talk about whatever 
you're carrying on your back: your house, your car, your kids'college education - maybe 
you've got a wife with a taste for clothes a little fancier than she can by rights afford . . . see?' 
'Sounding you out?' 
'It's more like feeling you up,' he said, and then laughed. 'But yeah. The dance is every bit 
as mannered as a minuet. There are all sorts of phrases and pauses and steps. After the guy 
finds out what sort of financial burdens you'd like to get rid of, he starts asking you what sort 
of things you'd like to have. A Cadillac, a summer place in the Catskills or the Poconos, 
maybe a boat. 
I gave a little start at that, because I knew my dad wanted a boat about as badly as he 
wanted anything these days; a couple of times I had gone with him on sunny summer 
afternoons to marinas along King George Lake and Lake Passeeonkee. He'd price out the 
smaller yachts and I'd see the wistful look in his eyes. Now I understood it. They were out of 
his reach. Maybe if his life had taken a different turn - if he didn't have kids to think about 
putting through college, for instance - they wouldn't have been. 
 
'And you said no?' I asked him. 
He shrugged. 'I made it clear pretty early on that I didn't want to dance. For one thing, it 
would have meant getting more involved with him on a personal level, and, as I said, I 
thought he was a skunk. For another thing, these guys are all fundamentally stupid about 
numbers - which is why so many of them have gone up on tax convictions. They think you 
can hide illegal income. They're sure of it. He laughed. 'They've all got this mystic idea that 
you can wash money like you wash clothes, when all you can really do is juggle it until 
something falls down and smashes all over your head.' 
'Those were the reasons?' 
'Two out of three.' He looked in my eyes. 'I'm no fucking crook, Dennis.' 
There was a moment of electric communication between us - even now, four years later, I 
get goosebumps thinking of it, although I'm by no means sure that I can get it across to you. It 
wasn't that he treated me like an equal for the first time that night; it wasn't even that he was 
showing me the wistful knight-errant still hiding inside the button-down man scrambling for 
a living in a dirty, hustling world. I think it was sensing him as a reality, a person who had 
existed long before I ever came onstage, a person who had eaten his share of mud. In that 
moment I think I could have imagined him making love to my mother, both of them sweaty 
and working hard to make it, and not have been embarrassed. 
Then he dropped his eyes, grinned a defensive grin, and did his husky Nixon-voice, which 
he was very good at: 'You people deserve to know if your father is a crook. Well, I am not a 
crook, I could have taken the money, but that . . . harrum! . . . that would have been wrong.'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">I laughed too loud, a release of tension - I felt the moment passing, and although part of me 
didn't want it to pass, part of me did; it was too intense . I think maybe he felt that, too. 
'Shhh, you'll wake your mother and she'll give us both the devil for being up this late.' 
'Yeah, sorry. Dad, do you know what he's into? Darnell?' 
'I didn't know then; I didn't want to know, because then I'd be a part of it. I had my ideas, 
and I've heard a few things. Stolen cars, I imagine - not that he'd run them through that garage 
on Hampton Street; he's not a completely stupid man, and only an idiot shits where he eats. 
Maybe hijacking as well.' 
'Guns and stuff?' I asked, sounding a little hoarse. 
'Nothing so romantic. If I had to guess, I'd guess cigarettes, mostly - cigarettes and booze, 
the two old standbys. Contraband like fireworks. Maybe a shipment of microwave ovens or 
colour TVs every once in a while, if the risk looked low. Enough to keep him busy these 
many years.' 
He looked at me soberly. 
'He's played the odds good, but he's also been lucky for a long time, Dennis. Oh, maybe he 
hasn't really needed luck here in town - if it was just Libertyville, I guess he could go on for 
ever, or at least until he dropped dead of a heart attack - but the state tax boys are sand sharks 
and the feds are Great Whites. He's been lucky, but one of these days they're going to fall on 
him like the Great Wall of China.' 
'Have you . . . have you heard things?' 
'Not a whisper. Nor am I apt to. But I like Arnie Cunningham a great deal, and I know 
you've been worried about this car thing.' 
'Yeah.' He's . . . he's not acting healthy about it, Dad. Everything's the car, the car, the car.' 
'People who have not had a great deal tend to do that,' he said. 'Sometimes it's a car, 
sometimes it's a girl, sometimes it's a career or a musical instrument or an unhealthy 
obsession with some famous person. I went to college with a tall, ugly fellow we all called 
Stork. With Stork it was his model train set . . . he'd been hooked on model trains ever since 
the third grade, and his set was pretty damn near the eighth wonder of the world. He flunked 
out of Brown the second semester of his freshman year. His grades were going to hell, and 
what it came down to was a choice between college and his Lionels. Stork picked the trains.' 
'What happened to him?' 
'He killed himself in 1961,' my father said, and stood up 'My point is just that good people 
can sometimes get blinded, and it's not always their fault. Probably Darnell will forget all 
about him - he'll just be another guy tinkering around under his car on a crawlie-gator. But if 
Darnell tries to use him, you be his eyes, Dennis. Don't let him get pulled into the dance.'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'All right. I'll try. But there may not be that much I can do.' 
'Yeah. How well I know it. Want to go up?' 
'Sure.' 
* * * * * 
We went up, and' tired as I was, I lay awake a long time. It had been an eventful day. 
Outside, a night wind tapped a branch softly against the side of the house, and far away, 
downtown, I heard some kid's rod peeling rubber - it made a sound in the night like an 
hysterical woman's desperate laughter.</p>

We've put the past away . . . 
- Elvis Costello 
 
Between working on the construction project days and working on Christine nights, Arnie 
hadn't been seeing much of his folks. Relations there had been getting pretty strained and 
abrasive. The Cunningham house, which had always been pleasant and low-key in the past, 
was now an armed camp. It is a state of affairs a lot of people can remember from their 
teenage years, guess; too many, maybe. The kid is egotistical enough to think he or she is the 
first person in the world to discover some particular thing (usually it's a girl, but it doesn't 
have to be), and the parents are too scared and stupid and possessive to want to let go of the 
halter. Sins on both sides. Sometimes it gets painful and outrageous - no war is as dirty and 
bitter as a civil war. And it was particularly painful in Arnie's case because the split had come 
so late, and his folks had gotten much too used to having their own way. It wouldn't be unfair 
to say that they had blueprinted his life. 
So when Michael and Regina proposed a four-day weekend at their lakeshore cottage in 
upstate New York before school started again, Arnie said yes even though he badly wanted 
those last four days to work on Christine. More and more often at work he had told me how 
he was going to  'show them'; he was going to turn Christine into a real street-rod and 'show 
them all'. He had already planned to restore the car to its original bright red and ivory after 
the bodywork was done. 
But he went off with them, determined to yassuh and tug his forelock for the whole four 
days and have a good time with his folks - or a reasonable facsimile. I got over the evening 
before they left and was relieved to find they had both absolved me of blame in the affair of 
Arnie's car (which they still hadn't even seen). They had apparently decided it was a private 
obsession. That was fine by me. 
Regina was busy packing. Arnie and Michael and I got their Oldtown canoe on top of their 
Scout and tied it down. When it was done, Michael suggested to his son - with the air of a 
powerful king conferring an almost unbelievable favour on two of his favourite subjects - that 
Arnie go in and get a few beers. 
Arnie, affecting both the expression and the tones of amazed gratitude, said that would be 
super. As he left, he dropped a wink my way.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Michael leaned against the Scout and lit a cigarette. 'Is he going to get tired of this car 
business, Denny?' 
'I don't know,' I said. 
'You want to do me a favour?' 
'Sure, if I can,' I said cautiously I was pretty sure he was going to ask me to go to Arnie, act 
the Dutch uncle part, and try to 'talk him out of it'. 
But instead he said, 'If you get a chance, go down to Darnell's while we're gone and see 
what sort of progress he's making. I'm interested.' 
'Why is that?' I asked, thinking immediately it was a pretty damn rude question - but by 
then it was already out. 
'Because I want him to succeed,' he said simply, and glanced at me. 'Oh, Regina's still dead 
set against it. If he has a car, that means he's growing up. And if he's growing up, that means . 
. . all sorts of things,' he finished lamely. 'But I'm not so down on it. You couldn't characterize 
me as dead set against it anyway, at least not anymore. Oh, he caught me by surprise at first . 
. . I had visions of some dead dog sitting out in front of our house until Arnie went off to 
college - that or him choking to death on the exhaust some night.' 
The thought of Veronica LeBay jumped into my head, all unbidden. 
'But now . . . ' He shrugged, glanced at the door between the garage and the kitchen, 
dropped his cigarette, and scuffed it out. 'He's obviously committed. He's got his sense of 
self-respect on the line. I'd like to see him at least get it running.' 
Maybe he saw something in my face; when he went on he sounded defensive. 
'I haven't quite forgotten everything about being young,' he said. 'I know a car is important 
to a kid Arnie's age. Regina can't see that quite so clearly. She always got picked up. She was 
never faced with the problems of being the picker-upper. I remember that a car is important . . 
. if a kid's ever going to have any dates.' 
So that's where he thought it was at. He saw Christine as a means to an end rather than as 
the end itself. I wondered what he'd think if I told him that I didn't think Arnie had ever 
looked any further than getting the Fury running and legal. I wondered if that would make 
him more or less uneasy. 
The thump of the kitchen door closing. 
'Would you go take a look?' 
'I guess so,' I said. 'If you want.' 
'Thanks.'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Arnie came back with the beers. 'What's the thanks for?' he asked Michael. His voice was 
light and humorous, but his eyes flicked between us carefully. I noticed again that his 
complexion was really clearing, and his face seemed to have strengthened. For the first time, 
the two thoughts Arnie and dates didn't seem mutually exclusive. It occurred to me that his 
face was almost handsome - not in any jut-jawed lifeguard king-of-the-prom way, but in an 
interesting, thoughtful way. He would never be Roseanne's type, but . . . 
'For helping with the, canoe,' Michael said casually. 
'Oh.' 
We drank our beers. I went home. The next day the happy threesome went off together to 
New York, presumably to rediscover the family unity that had been lost over the latter third 
of the summer. 
* * * * * 
The day before they were due back I took a ride down to Darnell's Garage - as much to 
satisfy my own curiosity as Michael Cunningham's. 
The garage, standing in front of the block-long lot of junked cars, looked just as attractive 
in daylight as it had on the evening we had brought Christine - it had all the charm of a dead 
gopher. 
I pulled into a vacant slot in front of the speed shop that Darnell also ran - well stocked with 
such items as Feully heads, Hurst gearboxes, and Ram-Jett superchargers (for all those 
working men who had to keep their old cars running so they could continue to put bread on 
the table, no doubt), not to mention a wide selection of huge mutant tyres and a variety of 
spinner hubcaps. Looking through the window of Darnell's speed shop was like looking into a 
crazy automotive Disneyland. 
I got out and walked back across the tarmac toward the garage and the clanging sound of 
tools, shouts, the machine-gun blast of pneumatic wrenches. A sleazy-looking guy in a 
cracked leather jacket was dorking around with an old BSA bike by one of the garage bays, 
either removing the bike's manifold or putting it back on. There was a stutter of road-rash 
down his left cheek. The back of his jacket displayed a skull wearing a Green Beret and the 
charming motto KILL EM ALL AND LET GOD SORT EM OUT. 
He looked up at me with bloodshot and lunatic Rasputin eyes, then looked back at what he 
was doing. He had a surgical array of tools spread out beside him, each one die-stamped with 
the words DARNELL'S GARAGE. 
Inside, the world was full of the echoey, evocative bang of tools and the sound of men 
working on cars and hollering profanity at the rolling iron they were working on. Always the 
profanity, and always female in gender: come offa there you bitch, come loose, you cunt, 
come on over here, Rick, and help me get this twat off.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">I looked around for Darnell and didn't see him any place No one took any particular notice 
of me, so I walked over to stall twenty where Christine sat, now pointing nose-out, just like I 
had every right in the world to be there. In the stall to the right, two fat guys in bowling 
league shirts were putting a camper cap on the back of a pickup truck that had seen better 
days. The stall on the other side was deserted. 
As I approached Christine, I felt that chill coming back. There was no reason for it, but I 
seemed helpless to stop it - and without even thinking, I moved a bit to the left, toward the 
empty stall. I didn't want to be in front of her. 
My first thought was that Arnie's complexion had improved in tandem with Christine's. My 
second thought was that he was making his improvements in a strangely haphazard way . . . 
and Arnie was usually so methodical. 
The twisted, broken aerial had been replaced with a straight new one that glimmered under 
the fluorescent bars. Half the Fury's front grille had been replaced; the other half was still 
flecked and pitted with rust. And there was something else. . .. 
I walked along her flank right to the rear bumper, frowning. 
Well, it was on the other side, that's all, I thought. 
So I walked around to the other side, and it wasn't there, either. 
I stood by the back wall, still frowning, trying to remember. I was pretty sure that when we 
first saw her standing on LeBay's lawn, with a FOR SALE sign propped against her 
windscreen, there had been a good-sized rusty dent on one side or the other, near the rear end 
- the sort of deep dent that my grandfather always called a 'hoss-kick'. We'd be driving along 
the turnpike and we'd go by a car with a big dent in it somewhere and Grampy would say, 
'Hey, Denny, take a look there! Hoss kicked that one!' My grandfather was the sort of guy 
who had a downhome phrase for everything. 
I started to think I must have imagined it, and then gave my head a little shake. That was 
sloppy thinking. It had been there; I remembered it clearly. Just because it wasn't here now 
didn't mean it hadn't been then. Arnie had obviously knocked it out, and had done a damn 
good piece of bodywork covering it up. 
Except . . . 
There was no sign that he had done anything. There was no primer paint, no grey body fill, 
no flaked paint. Just Christine's dull red and dirty white. 
But it had been there, goddammit! A deep dimple filled with a snarl of rust, on one side or 
the other. 
But it sure was gone now.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">I stood there in the clatter and thud of tools and machinery and felt very alone and suddenly 
very scared. It was all wrong, it was all crazy. He had replaced the radio aerial when the 
exhaust was practically dragging on the ground. He had replaced one half of the grille but not 
the other. He had talked to me about doing a front-end job, but inside he had replaced the 
ripped and dusty back seat cover with a bright red new one. The front seat cover was still a 
dusty wreck with a spring peeking through the passenger side. 
I didn't like it at all. It was crazy and it wasn't like Arnie. 
Something came to me, a trace of memory, and without even thinking about it, I stood back 
and looked at the entire car - not just one thing here and one thing there, but everything. And 
I had it; it clicked into place, and the chill came back. 
That night when we had brought it here. The flat tyre. The replacement. I had looked at that 
new tyre on that old car and thought it was as if a little bit of the old car had been scratched 
away and that the new car - fresh, resplendent, just off the assembly line in a year when Ike 
had been President and Batista had still been in charge of Cuba - was peeking through. 
What I was seeing now was like that . . . only instead of just a single new tyre, there were 
all sorts of things - the aerial, a wink of new chrome from the grille, one taillight that was a 
bright deep red, that new seat cover in the back. 
In its turn, that brought back something else from childhood. Arnie and I had gone to 
Vacation Bible School together for two weeks each summer, and every day the teacher would 
tell a Bible story and leave it unfinished. Then she would give each kid a blank sheet of 
'magic paper'. And if you scraped the edge of a coin or the side of your pencil over it, a 
picture would gradually emerge out of the white - the dove bringing the olive branch back to 
Noah, the walls of Jericho tumbling down, good miracle stuff like that. It used to fascinate 
both of us, seeing the pictures gradually emerge. At first just lines floating in the void . . . and 
then the lines would connect with other lines they would take on coherence . . . take on 
meaning . . . 
I looked at Arnie's Christine with growing horror, trying to shake the feeling that in her I 
was seeing something terribly similar to those magic miracle pictures. 
I wanted to look under the hood. 
Suddenly it seemed very important that I look under the hood. 
I went around to the front (I didn't like to stand in front of it - no good reason why not, I 
just didn't) and fumbled around for the hood release. I couldn't get it. Then I realised that it 
was probably inside. 
I started to go around, and then I saw something else, something that scared me shitless. I 
could have been wrong about the hoss-kick, I suppose. I knew I wasn't, but at least 
technically . . . 
But this was something else entirely.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">The web of cracks in the windscreen was smaller. 
I was positive it was smaller. 
My mind raced back to that day a month ago when I had wandered into LeBay's garage to 
look at the car while Arnie went into the house with the old man to do the deal. The entire left 
side of the windscreen had been a spider's web of cracks radiating out from one central, 
zigzagging fault that had probably been caused by a flying stone. 
Now the spider's web seemed smaller, simpler - you could see into the car from that side, 
and you hadn't been able to before, I was sure of that (just a trick of the light, that's all, my 
mind whispered). 
Yet I had to be wrong - because it was impossible. Simply impossible. You could replace a 
windscreen; that was no problem if you had the money. But to make a webbing of cracks 
shrink - 
I laughed a little. It was a shaky sound, and one of the guys working on the camper cap 
looked up at me curiously and said something to his buddy. It was a shaky sound, but maybe 
better than no sound at all. Of course it was the light, and nothing more. I had seen the car for 
the first time with the westering sun shining fully on the flawed windscreen, and I had seen it 
the second time in the shadows of LeBay's garage. Now I was seeing it under these high-set 
fluorescent tubes. Three different kinds of light, and all it added up to was an optical illusion. 
Still, I wanted to look under the hood. More than ever, 
I went around to the driver's side door and gave it a yank. The door didn't open. It was 
locked. Of course it was; all four of the door-lock buttons were down, Arnie wouldn't be apt 
to leave it unlocked in here, so anybody could get inside and poke around. Maybe Repperton 
was gone, but genus Creepus was weed-common. I laughed again - silly old Dennis - but this 
time it sounded even more shrill and shaky. I was starting to feel spaced-out, the way I 
sometimes felt the morning after I smoked a little too much pot. 
Locking the Fury's doors was a very natural thing to do, all right. Except that, when I 
walked around the car the first time, I thought I had noticed the door-lock buttons had all 
been up. 
I stepped slowly backward again, looking at the car. It sat there, still little more than a 
rusting hulk. I was not thinking any one thing specific - I am quite sure of that - except maybe 
it was as if it knew that I wanted to get inside and pull the release. 
And because it didn't want me to do that, it had locked its own doors? 
That was really a very humorous idea. So humorous that I had another laugh (several 
people were glancing at me now, the way that folks always glance at people who laugh for no 
apparent reason when they are by themselves).</p>
      <p class="calibre3">A big hand fell on my shoulder and turned me around. It was Darnell, with a dead stub of 
cigar stuck in the side of his mouth. The end of it was wet and pretty gross-looking. He was 
wearing small half-specs, and the eyes behind them were coldly speculative. 
'What are you doing, kiddo?' he asked. 'This ain't your property.' 
The guys with the camper cap were watching us avidly. One of them nudged the other and 
whispered something. 
'It belongs to a friend of mine,' I said. 'I brought it in with him. Maybe you remember me. I 
was the one with the large skin-tumour on the end of my nose and the - ' 
'I don't give a shit if you wheeled it in on a skateboard,' he said. 'It ain't your property. Take 
your bad jokes and get lost, kid. Blow.' 
My father was right - he was a wretch. And I would have been more than happy to blow; I 
could think of at least six thousand places I'd rather be on this second-to-last day of my 
summer vacation. Even the Black Hole of Calcutta would have been an improvement. Not a 
big one, maybe, yet an improvement, all the same. But the car bothered me. A lot of little 
things, all adding up to a big itch that needed to be scratched. Be his eyes, my father had said, 
and that sounded good. The problem was I couldn't believe what I was seeing. 
'My name is Dennis Guilder,' I said 'My dad used to do your books, didn't he?' 
He looked at me for a long time with no expression at all in his cold little pig eyes, and I 
was suddenly sure he was going to tell me he didn't give a fuck who my father was, that I'd 
better blow and let these working men go about the business of fixing their cars so they could 
go on putting bread on their tables. Et cetera. 
Then he smiled - but the smile didn't touch his eyes at all. 'You're Kenny Guilder's boy?' 
'Yes, that's right.' 
He patted the hood of Arnie's car with one pale, fat hand - there were two rings on it, and 
one of them looked like a real diamond. Still, what does a kid like me know? 
'I guess you're straight enough, then. If you're Kenny's kid.' There was a second when I 
thought he was going to ask for some identification. 
The two guys next to us had gone back to work on their camper, apparently having decided 
nothing interesting was going to transpire. 
'Come on into the office and let's have a talk he said, then turned away and moved across 
the floor without even a glance backward. That I would comply was taken for granted. He 
moved like a ship under full sail, his white shirt billowing, the girth of his hips and backside 
amazing, improbable. Very fat people always affect me that way, with a feeling of distinct 
improbability, as if I were looking at a very good optical illusion - but then, I come from a 
long line of skinny people. For my family I'm a heavyweight.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">He paused here and there on his way back to his office, which had a glass wall looking out 
onto the garage. Darnell reminded me a little bit of Moloch, the god we read about in my 
Origins of Literature class - he was the one who was supposed to be able to see everywhere 
with his one red eye. Darnell bawled at one guy to get the hose on his exhaust before he 
threw him out; yelled something to another guy about how 'Nicky's back was acting up on 
him again' (this inspired a fuming, ferocious burst of laughter from both of them); hollered at 
another guy to pick up those fucking Pepsi-Cola cans, was he born in a dump? Apparently 
Will Darnell didn't know anything about what my mother always called 'a normal tone of 
voice'. 
After a moment's hesitation, I followed him. Curiosity killed the cat, I suppose. 
* * * * * 
His office was done in Early American Carburettor - it was every scuzzy garage office from 
coast to coast in a country that runs on rubber and amber gold. There was a greasy calendar 
with a pin-up of a blond goddess in short-shorts and an open blouse climbing over a fence in 
the country. There were unreadable plaques from half a dozen companies which sold auto 
parts. Stacks of ledgers. An ancient adding machine. There was a photograph, God save us, of 
Will Darnell wearing a Shriner's fez and mounted on a miniature motorcycle that looked 
about to collapse under his bulk. And there was the smell of long-departed cigars and sweat. 
Darnell sat down in a swivel chair with wooden arms. The cushion wheezed beneath him. It 
sounded tired but resigned. He leaned back. He took a match from the hollow head of a 
ceramic Negro jockey. He struck it on a strip of sandpaper that ran along one edge of his desk 
and fired up the wet stub of cigar. He coughed long and hard, his big, loose chest heaving up 
and down. Directly behind him, tacked to the wall, was a picture of Garfield the Cat. 'Want a 
trip to Loose-Tooth City?' Garfield was enquiring over one cocked paw. It seemed to sum up 
Will Darnell, Wretch in Residence, perfectly. 
'Want a Pepsi, kid?' 
'No, thank you,' I said, and sat down in the straight chair opposite him. 
He looked at me - that cold look of appraisal again and then nodded. 'How's your dad, 
Dennis? His ticker still okay?' 
'He's fine. When I told him Arnie had his car here, he remembered you right off. He says 
Bill Upshaw's doing your figures now.' 
'Yeah. Good man. Good man. Not as good as your dad, but good.' 
I nodded. A silence fell between us, and I began to feel uneasy. Will Darnell didn't look 
uneasy; he didn't look anything at all. That cold look of appraisal never changed. 
'Did your buddy send you to find out if Repperton was really gone?' he asked me, so 
suddenly that I jumped.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'No,' I said. 'Not at all.' 
'Well, you tell him he is,' Darnell went on, ignoring what I'd just said. 'Little wiseass. I tell 
em when they run their junk in here: get along or get out. He was working for me, doing a 
little of this and a little of that, and I guess he thought he had the gold key to the crapper or 
something. Little wiseass punk.' 
He started coughing again and it was a long time before he stopped. It was a sick sound, I 
was beginning to feel claustrophobic in the office, even with the window looking out on the 
garage. 
'Arnie's a good boy,' Darnell said presently, still measuring me with his eyes, Even while he 
was coughing, that expression hadn't changed. 'He's picked up the slack real good.' 
Doing what? I wanted to ask, and just didn't dare. 
Darnell told me anyway. Cold glance aside, he was apparently feeling expansive. 'Sweeps 
the floor, takes the crap out of the garage bays at the end of the day, keeps the tools 
inventoried, along with Jimmy Sykes. Have to be careful with tools around here, Dennis. 
They got a way of walkin away when your back's turned.' He laughed, and the laugh turned 
into a wheeze. 'Got him started strippin parts out back, as well. He's got good hands. Good 
hands and bad taste in cars. I ain't seen such a dog as that '58 in years.' 
'Well, I guess he sees it as a hobby,' I said. 
'Sure,' Darnell said expansively. 'Sure he does. Just as long as he doesn't want to ramrod 
around with it like that punk, that Repperton. But not much chance of that for a while, huh?' 
'I guess not. It looks pretty wasted.' 
'What the fuck is he doing to it?' Darnell asked. He leaned forward suddenly, his big 
shoulders going up all the way to his hairline. His brows pulled in, and his eyes disappeared 
except for small twin gleams. 'What the fuck is he up to? I been in this business all my life, 
and I never seen anyone go at fixing a car up the crazy-ass way he is. Is it a joke? A game?' 
'I'm not getting you,' I said, although I was - I was getting him perfectly. 
'Then I'll draw you a pitcher,' Darnell said. 'He brings it in, and at first he's doing all the 
things I'd expect him to do. What the fuck, he ain't got money falling out of his asshole, right? 
If he did, he wouldn't be here. He changes the oil. He changes the filter. Grease-job, lube, I 
see one day he's got two new Firestones for the front to go with the two on the back.' 
Two on the back? I wondered, and then decided he'd just bought three new tyres to go with 
the original new one I'd gotten the night we were bringing it over here. 
'Then I come in one day and see he's replaced the windscreen wipers,' Darnell continued 
'Not so strange, except that the car's not going to be going anywhere - rain or shine - for a 
long time . Then it's a new aerial for the radio, and I think, He's gonna listen to the radio</p>
      <p class="calibre3">while he's working on it and drain his battery. Now he's got one new seat cover and half a 
grille. So what is it? A game?' 
'I don't know,' I said. 'Did he buy the replacement parts from you?' 
'No,' Darnell said, sounding aggravated. 'I don't know where he gets them. That grille - 
there isn't a spot of rust on it. He must have ordered it from somewhere. Custom Chrysler in 
New Jersey or someplace like that, But where's the other half? Up his ass? I never even heard 
of a grille that came in two pieces.' 
'I don't know. Honest.' 
He jammed the cigar out, 'Don't tell me you're not curious, though. I saw the way you was 
lookin at that car.' I shrugged. 'Arnie doesn't talk about it much,' I said. 
'No, I bet he doesn't. He's a close-mouthed sonofabitch. He's a fighter, though. That 
Repperton pushed the wrong button when he started in on Cunningham. If he works out okay 
this fall, I might find a steady job for him this winter. Jimmy Sykes is a good boy, but he ain't 
much in the brains department.' His eyes measured me. 'Think he's a pretty good worker, 
Dennis?' 
'He's okay.' 
'I got lots of irons in the fire,' he said. 'Lot of irons. I rent out flatbeds to guys that need to 
haul their stockers up to Philadelphia City. I haul away the junkets after races. I can always 
use help. Good, trustworthy help.' 
I began to have a horrid suspicion that I was being asked to dance. I got up hurriedly, 
almost knocking over the straight chair. 'I really ought to get going,' I said. 'And . . . Mr 
Darnell . . . I'd appreciate it if you didn't mention to Arnie that I was here. He's. . a little 
touchy about the car. To tell you the truth, his father was curious about how he was coming 
along.' 
'Took a little shit on the home front, did he?' Darnell's right eye closed shrewdly in 
something that was not quite a wink, 'Folks ate a few pounds of Ex-Lax and then stood over 
him with their legs spread, did they?' 
'Yeah, well, you know.' 
'You bet I know.' He was up in one smooth motion and clapped me on the back hard 
enough to stagger me on my feet. Wheezy respiration and cough or not, he was strong. 
'Wouldn't mention it,' he said, walking me toward the door. His hand was still on my 
shoulder, and that also made me feet nervous - and a little disgusted. 
'I tell you something else that bothers me,' he said. 'I must see a hundred thousand cars a 
year in this place well, not that many, but you know what I mean - and I got an eye for em.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">You know, I could swear I've seen that one before. When it wasn't such a dog. Where did he 
get it?' 
'From a man named Roland LeBay,' I said, thinking of LeBay's brother telling me that 
LeBay did all the maintenance himself at some do-it-yourself garage. 'He's dead now.' 
Darnell stopped cold. 'LeBay? Rollie LeBay?' 
'Yes, that's right.' 
'Army? Retired?' 
'Yes.' 
'Holy Christ, sure! He brought it in Here just as regular as clockwork for six maybe eight 
years, then he stopped coming. A long time ago. What a bastard that man was. If you poured 
boiling water down that whoremaster's throat, he would have peed ice cubes. He couldn't get 
along with a living soul.' He gripped my shoulder harder. 'Does your friend Cunningham 
know LeBay's wife committed suicide in that car?' 
'What?' I said, acting surprised - I didn't want him to know I'd been interested enough to 
talk to LeBay's brother after the funeral. I was afraid Darnell might repeat the information to 
Arnie - complete with his source. 
Darnell told me the whole story. First the daughter, then the mother. 
'No,' I said when he was done. 'I'm pretty sure Arnie doesn't know that. Are you going to 
tell him?' The eyes, appraising again. 'Are you?' 
'No,' I said. 'I don't see any reason to. 
'Then neither do I.' He opened the door, and the greasy air of the garage smelled almost 
sweet after the cigar smoke in the office. 'That sonofabitch LeBay, I'll be damned. I hope he's 
doing right-face-left-face and to-the-rear-march down in hell.' His mouth turned down 
viciously for just a moment, and then he glanced over at where Christine sat in stall twenty 
with her old, rusting paint and her new radio aerial and half a grille. 'That bitch back again,' 
he said, and then he glanced at me. 'Well, they say bad pennies always turn up, huh?' 
'Yes,' I said. 'I guess they do.' 
'So long, kid,' he said, sticking a fresh cigar in his mouth. 'Say hi to your dad for me.' 
'I will.' 
'And tell Cunningham to keep an eye out for that punk Repperton. I got an idea he might be 
the sort who'd hold a grudge.' 
'Me too,' I said.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">I walked out of the garage, pausing once to glance back  but looking in from the glare, 
Christine was little more than a shadow among shadows. Bad pennies always turn up, Darnell 
said. It was a phrase that followed me home.</p>

- Steely Dan 
 
School started, and nothing much happened for a week or two. Arnie didn't find out I'd been 
down to the garage, and I was glad. I don't think he would have taken kindly to the news. 
Darnell kept his mouth shut as he had promised (probably for his own reasons). I called 
Michael one afternoon after school when I knew Arnie would be down at the garage. I told 
him Arnie had done some stuff to the car, but it was nowhere near street-legal. I told him my 
impression was that Arnie was mostly farting around. Michael greeted this news with a 
mixture of relief and surprise, but that ended it . . . for a while. 
Arnie himself flickered in and out of my view, like something you see from the corner of 
your eye. He was around the halls, and we had three classes together, and he sometimes came 
over after school or on weekends. There were times when it really seemed as if nothing had 
changed. But he was at Darnell's a lot more than he was at my house, and on Friday nights he 
went out to Philly Plains - the stock-car track - with Darnell's half-bright handyman, Jimmy 
Sykcs. They ran out sportsters and charger-class racers, mostly Camaros and Mustangs with 
all their glass knocked out and roll bars installed. They took them out on Darnell's flatbed and 
came back with fresh junk for the automobile graveyard. 
It was around that time that Arnie hurt his back. It wasn't a serious injury - or so he claimed 
- but my mother noticed that something was wrong with him almost right away. He came 
over one Sunday to watch the Phillies, who were pounding down the home-stretch to 
moderate glory that year, and happened to get up during the third inning to pour us each a 
glass of orange juice. My mother was sitting on the couch with my father, reading a book. 
She glanced up when Arnie came back in and said, 'You're limping, Arnie.' 
I thought I saw a surprising, unexpected expression on Arnie's face for a second or two - a 
furtive, almost guilty look. I could have been wrong. If it was there, it was gone a second 
later. 
'I guess I strained my back out at the Plains last night,' he said, giving me my orange juice. 
'Jimmy Sykes stalled out the last of the clunks we were loading just when it was almost up on 
the bed of the truck. I could see it rolling back down and then the two of us goofing around 
for another two hours, trying to get it started again. So I gave it a shove. Guess I shouldn't 
have.'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">It seemed like an elaborate explanation for a simple little limp, but I could have been wrong 
about that too. 
'You have to be more careful of your back,' my mother said severely. 'The Lord - ' 
'Mom, could we watch the game now?' I asked. 
' - only gives you one,' she finished. 
'Yes, Mrs Guilder,' Arnie said dutifully. 
Elaine wandered in. 'Is there any more juice, or did you two coneheads drink it all?' 
'Come on, give me a break!' I yelled. There had been some sort of disputed play at second 
and I had missed the whole thing. 
'Don't shout at your sister, Dennis,' my father muttered from the depths of The Hobbyist 
magazine he was reading. 
'There's a lot left, Ellie,' Arnie told her. 
'Sometimes, Arnie,' Elaine told him, 'you strike as almost human.' She flounced out to the 
kitchen. 
'Almost human, Dennis!' Arnie whispered to me, apparently on the verge of grateful tears. 
'Did you hear that? Almost hyooooman.' 
And perhaps it is also only retrospection - or imagination - that makes me think his humour 
was forced, unreal, only a fa–∑ade. False memory or true one, the subject of his back passed 
off, although that limp came and went all through the fall. 
* * * * * 
I was pretty busy in myself. The cheerleader and I had broken it off, but I could usually find 
someone to step out with on Saturday nights . . . if I wasn't too tired from the constant 
football practice. 
Coach Puffer wasn't a wretch like Will Darnell, but he was no rose; like half the smalltown 
high school coaches in America, he had patterned his coaching techniques on those of the late 
Vince Lombardi, whose chief scripture was that winning wasn't everything, it was the only 
thing. You'd be surprised how many people who should know better believe that half-baked 
horseshit. 
A summer of working for Carson Brothers had left me in rugged shape and I think I could 
have cruised through the season - if it had been a winning season. But by the time Arnie and I 
had the ugly confrontation near the smoking area behind the shop with Buddy Repperton - 
and I think that was during the third week of classes - it was pretty clear we weren't going to 
have a Winning season. That made Coach Puffer extremely hard to live with, because in his</p>
      <p class="calibre3">ten years at LHS, he had never had a losing season. That was the year Coach Puffer had to 
learn a bitter humility. It was a hard lesson for him . . . and it wasn't so easy for us, either. 
Our first game, away against the Luneburg Tigers, was September 9th. Now, Luneburg is 
just that - a burg. It's a little piss-ant rural high school at the extreme west end of our district, 
and over my years at Libertyville, the usual battle cry after Luneburg's bumbling defence had 
allowed yet another touchdown was TELL-US-HOW-IT-FEELSTO-HAVE-COWSHIT-ON-
YOUR-HEELS! Followed by a big, sarcastic cheer: RAAAAYYYYYY, LUUUUNEBURG! 
It had been over twenty years since Luneburg beat a Libertyville team, but that year they 
rose up and smote us righteously. I was playing left end, and by halftime I was morally sure 
that I was going to have cleat-mark scars all over my back for the rest of my life. By then the 
score was 17-3. It ended up 30-10. The Luneburg fans were delirious; they tore down the 
goalposts as if it had been the Regional Championship game and carried their players off the 
field on their shoulders. 
Our fans, who had come up in buses specially laid on, sat huddled on the visitors' bleachers 
in the blaring early September heat, looking blank. In the dressing room, Coach Puffer, 
looking stunned and pallid, suggested we get down on our knees and pray for guidance in the 
weeks to come. I knew then that the hurting had not ended but was just beginning. 
We got down on our knees, aching, bruised and battered, wanting nothing but to get into the 
shower and start washing that loser smell off ourselves, and listened as Coach Puffer 
explained the situation to God in a ten-minute peroration that ended with a promise that we 
would do our part if He would do His. 
The next week, we practised three hours a day (instead of the customary ninety minutes to 
two hours) under the broiling sun. I tumbled into bed nights and dreamed of his bellowing 
voice: ‚ÄúHit that sucker! Hit! HIT!‚Äù 
I ran windsprints until I began to feel that my legs were going to undergo spontaneous 
decomposition (at the same instant my lungs burst into flames, probably). Lenny Barongg, 
one of our tailbacks, had a mild sunstroke and was mercifully - for him, at least - excused for 
the rest of the week. 
So I saw Arnie, and he came over and took dinner with my folks and Ellie and me on 
Thursday or Friday nights, he checked out a ballgame or two with us on Sunday afternoons, 
but beyond that I lost sight of him almost completely. I was too busy hauling my aches and 
pains to class, to practice, then home to my room to do my assignments. 
Going back to my football woes - I think the worst thing was the way people looked at me, 
and Lenny, and the rest of the team, in the hallways. Now that 'school spirit' business is 
mostly a lot of bullshit made up by school administrators who remember having a helluva 
time at the Saturday-aftemoon gridiron contests of their youth but have conveniently 
forgotten that a lot of it resulted from being drunk, horny, or both. If you had held a rally in 
favour of legalizing marijuana, you would have seen some school spirit. But about football,</p>
      <p class="calibre3">basketball, and track, most of the student body didn't give a shit. They were too busy trying to 
get into college or someone's pants or trouble. Business as usual. 
All the same, you get used to being a winner - you start to take it for granted. Libertyville 
had been fielding killer football teams for a long time; the last time the school had had a 
losing record - at least, before my senior year - was twelve years before, in 1966. So in the 
week after the loss of Luneburg, while there was no weeping and gnashing of teeth, there 
were hurt, puzzled looks in the hall and some booing at the regular Friday afternoon rally at 
the end of period seven. The boos made Coach Puffer turn nearly purple, and he invited those 
'poor sports and fair-weather friends' to turn out Saturday afternoon to watch the comeback of 
the century. 
I don't know if the poor sports and fair-weather friends turned out or not, but I was there. 
We were at home, and our opponents were t e Ridge Rock Bears. Now Ridge Rock is a 
mining town, and while the kids going to Ridge Rock High are hicks, they are not soft hicks. 
They are mean, ugly, touch hicks. The year before, Libertyville's football team had barely 
edged them out for the regional title, and one of the local sports commentators had said it 
wasn't because Libertyville had a better team but because it had more warm bodies to draw 
on. Coach Puffer had hit the ceiling over that, too I, I can tell you, 
This, however, was the Bears' year. They steamrollered us. Fred Dann went out of the game 
with a concussion in the first period. In the second period, Norman Aleppo got a ride to the 
Libertyville Community Hospital with a broken arm. And in the last period, the Bears scored 
three consecutive touchdowns, two on punt returns. The final score was 40-6. All false 
modesty aside, I'll tell you that I scored the six. But I won't put realism aside with the 
modesty: I was lucky. 
So . . . another week of hell on the practice field. Another week of Coach yelling Hit that 
sucker. One day we practised for nearly four hours, and when Lenny suggested to Coach that 
it might be nice to have some time left for doing homework, I thought - just for an instant - 
that Puffer was going to belt him one. He had taken to jingling his keys constantly from hand 
to hand, reminding me of Captain Queeg in The Caine Mutiny, I believe that how you lose is 
a much better index into character than how you win. Puffer, who had never been 0-2 in his 
coaching career, reacted with baffled, pointless fury, like a caged tiger being teased by cruel 
children. 
The next Friday afternoon - that would have been September 22nd - the usual rally during 
the last fifteen minutes of period seven was cancelled. I didn't know any of the players who 
minded; standing up there and being introduced by twelve prancing cheerleaders for the 
umptyumpth time was sort of a bore. It was an ominous sign, all the same. That night we 
were invited back to the gym by Coach Puffer, where we went to the movies for two hours, 
watching our humiliation by the Tigers and the Bears in the game films. Perhaps this was 
supposed to fire us up, but it only depressed me. 
That night, before our second home game of the year, I had a peculiar dream. It was not 
exactly a nightmare, not like the one where I woke the house screaming, certainly, but it was .</p>
      <p class="calibre3">. . uncomfortable. We were playing the Philadelphia City Dragons, and a strong wind was 
blowing. The sounds of the cheers, the blaring, distorted voice of Chubby McCarthy from the 
loudspeaker as he announced downs and yards, even the sounds of players hitting other 
players, all sounded weird and echoey in that constant, flat wind. 
The faces in the stands seemed yellow and oddly shadowed, like the faces of Chinese 
masks. The cheerleaders danced and capered like jerky automatons. The sky was a queer 
grey, running with clouds. We were being badly beaten. Coach Puffer was yelling in plays, 
but no one could hear him. The Dragons were running away from us. The ball was always 
theirs. Lenny Barongg looked as if he was playing with terrible pain; his mouth was drawn 
down in a trembling bow like a mask of tragedy. 
I was hit, knocked down, run over. I lay on the playing field, far behind the line of 
scrimmage, writhing, trying to get my breath back. I looked up and there, parked in the 
middle of the track field, behind the visitors' bleachers, was Christine. Once more she was 
sparkling and brand-new, as if she had rolled out of the showroom only an hour before. 
Arnie was sitting on the roof, crosslegged like Buddha, looking at me expressionlessly. He 
hollered something at me, but the steady howl of the wind almost buried it. It sounded as if he 
said: Don't worry, Dennis. We'll take care of everything. So don't worry. All is cool. 
Take care of what? I wondered as I lay there on the dream playing field (which my 
dreaming self had, for some reason, converted into Astro-Turf), struggling for breath with my 
jock digging cruelly into the fork of my thighs just below my testicles. Take care of what? 
Of what? 
No answer. Only the baleful shine of Christine's yellow headlamps and Arnie sitting 
serenely crosslegged on her roof in that steady, rushing wind. 
* * * * * 
The next day we got out there and did battle for good old Libertyville High again, It wasn't 
as bad as it had been in my dream - that Saturday no one got hurt, and for a brief while in the 
third quarter it even looked as though we might have a chance - but then the Philadelphia 
City quarterback got lucky with a couple of long passes - when things start to go wrong, 
everything goes wrong - and we lost again. 
After the game, Coach Puffer just sat there on the bench. He wouldn't look at any of us. 
There were eleven games left on our schedule, but he was already a beaten man.</p>

She's my little deuce coupe,                                                                                                                   
You don't know what I got . . . 
                                   - The Beach Boys 
 
It was, I am quite sure, the Tuesday after our loss to the Philadelphia City Dragons that 
things began moving again. That would have been the 26th of September. 
Arnie and I had three classes together, and one of them was Topics in American History, a 
block course, period four. The first nine weeks were being taught by Mr Thompson, the head 
of the department. The subject of that first nine weeks was Two Hundred Years of Boom and 
Bust. Arnie called it a boing-boing-going-going class, because it was right before lunch and 
everybody's stomach seemed to be doing something interesting. 
When the class was over that day, a girl came over to Arnie and asked him if he had the 
English assignment. He did. He dug it out of his notebook carefully, and while he did, this 
girl watched him seriously with her dark blue eyes, never taking them off his face. Her hair 
was a darkish blond, the colour of fresh honey - not the strained stuff, but honey the way it 
first comes from the comb - and held back with a wide blue band that matched her eyes. 
Looking at her, my stomach did a happy little flip-flop. As she copied the assignment down, 
Arnie looked at her. 
That wasn't the first time I had seen Leigh Cabot, of course; she had transferred from a 
town in Massachusetts to Libertyville three weeks ago, so she had been around. Somebody 
had told me her father worked for 3-M, the people who make Scotch tape. 
It wasn't even the first time I had noticed her, because Leigh Cabot was, to put it with 
perfect simplicity, a beautiful girl. In a work of fiction, I've noticed that writers always invent 
a flaw here or a flaw there in the women and girls they make up, maybe because they think 
real beauty is a stereotype Or because they think a flaw or two makes the lady more realistic. 
So she'll be beautiful except her lower lip is too long, or in spite of the fact that her nose is a 
little too sharp, or maybe she's flat-chested. It's always something. 
But Leigh Cabot was just beautiful, with no qualifications. Her skin was fair and perfect, 
usually with a touch of perfectly natural colour. She stood about five feet eight, tall for a girt 
but not too tall, and her figure was lovely - firm, high breasts, a small waist that looked as if</p>
      <p class="calibre3">you could almost put your hands around it (anyway, you longed to try), nice hips, good legs. 
Beautiful face, sexy, smooth figure - artistically dull, I suppose, without a too-long lower lip 
or a sharp nose or a wrong bump or bulge anywhere (not even an endearing crooked tooth - 
she must have had a great orthodontist, too), but she sure didn't feel dull when you were 
looking at her. 
A few guys had tried to date her and had been pleasantly turned down. It was assumed she 
was probably carrying a torch for some guy back in Andover or Braintree or wherever it was 
she had come from, and that she'd probably come around in time. Two of the classes I had 
with Arnie I also had with Leigh, and I had only been biding my time before making my own 
move. 
Now, watching them steal glances at each other as Arnie found the assignment and she 
wrote it carefully down, I wondered if I was going to have a chance to make my move. Then 
I had to grin at myself. Arnie Cunningham, Ole Pizza-Face himself, and Leigh Cabot, That 
was totally ridiculous. That was -  
Then the interior smile sort of dried up. I noticed for the third time - the definitive time - 
that Arnie's complexion was taking care of itself with almost stunning rapidity. The 
blemishes were gone. Some of them had left those small, pitted scars along his checks, true, 
but if a guy's face is a strong one, those pits don't seem to matter as much - in a crazy sort of 
way they can even add character. 
Leigh and Arnie studied each other surreptitiously and I studied Arnie surreptitiously, 
wondering exactly when and how this miracle had taken place. The sunlight slanted strongly 
through the windows of Mr Thompson's room, delineating the lines of my friend's face 
clearly. He looked . . . older. As if he had beaten the blemishes and the acne not only by 
regular washing or the application of some special cream, but by somehow turning the clock 
ahead about three years. He was wearing his hair differently, too - it was shorter, and the 
sideburns he had affected ever since he could grow them (that was since about eighteen 
months ago) were gone. 
I thought back to that overcast afternoon when we had gone to see the Chuck Norris Kung-
fu picture. That was the first time I had noticed an improvement, I decided. Right around the 
time he had bought the car. Maybe that was it. Teenagers of the world, rejoice. Solve painful 
acne problems forever. Buy an old car and it will - 
The interior grin, which had been surfacing once more, suddenly went sour. 
Buy an old car and it will what? Change your head, your way of thinking, and thus change 
your metabolism? Liberate the real you? I seemed to hear Stukey James, our old high school 
math teacher, whispering his oft-repeated refrain in my own head: If we follow this line of 
reasoning to the bitter end, ladies and gentlemen, where does it take us? 
Where indeed?</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'Thank you, Arnie,' Leigh said in her soft clear voice. She had folded the assignment into 
her notebook. 
'Sure,' he said. 
Their eyes met then - they were looking at each other instead of just sneaking glances at 
each other - and even I could feel the spark jump. 
'See you period six,' she said, and walked away, hips undulating gently under a green 
knitted skirt, hair swinging against the back of her sweater. 
'What have you got with her period six?' I asked. I had a study hall that period - and one 
proctored by the formidable Miss Raypach, whom all the kids called Miss Rat-Pack . . . but 
never to her face, you can believe that. 
'Calculus,' he said in this dreamy, syrupy voice that was so unlike his usual one that I got 
giggling. He looked around at me, brows drawing together. 'What are you laughing at, 
Dennis?' 
'Cal-Q-lussss,' I said. I rolled my eyes and flapped my hands and laughed harder. 
He made as if to punch me. 'You better watch it, Guilder,' he said. 
'Off my case, potato-face.' 
'They put you on varsity and look what happens to the fucking football team.' 
Mr Hodder, who teaches freshmen the finer points of grammar (and also how to jerk off, 
some wits said) happened to be passing by just then, and he frowned impressively at Arnie. 
'Watch your language in the halls,' he said, and passed onward, a briefcase in one hand and a 
hamburger from the hot-lunch line in the other. 
Arnie had gone beet-red; he always does when a teacher speaks to him (it was such an 
automatic reaction that when we were in grammar school he would end up getting punished 
for things he hadn't done just because he looked guilty). It probably says something about the 
way Michael and Regina brought him up - I'm okay, you're okay, I'm a person, you're a 
person, we all respect each other to the hilt, and whenever anybody does anything wrong, 
you're going to get what amounts to an allergic guilt reaction. All part of growing up liberal 
in America, I guess. 
'Watch your language, Cunningham,' I said. You in a heap o trouble.' 
Then he got laughing too. We walked down the echoing, banging hallway together. People 
rushed here and there or leaned up against their lockers, eating. You weren't supposed to eat 
in the hallways, but lots of people did. 
'Did you bring your lunch?' I asked. 
'Yeah, brown-bagging it.'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'Go get it. Let's eat out on the bleachers. 
'Aren't you sick of that football field by now?' Arnie asked. 'If you'd spent much more time 
on your belly last Saturday, I think one of the custodians would have planted you.' 
'I don't mind. We're playing away this week. And I want to get out of here.' 
'All right, meet you out there.' 
He walked away, and I went to my locker to get my lunch. I had four sandwiches, for 
starters. Since Coach Puffer had started his marathon practice sessions, it seemed as if I was 
always hungry. 
I walked down the hall, thinking about Leigh Cabot and how it would pretty much stand 
everyone on their car if they started going out together, High school society is very 
conservative, you know. No big lecture, but it is. The girls all wear the latest nutty fashions, 
the boys sometimes wear their hair most of the way down to their assholes, everyone is 
smoking a little dope or sniffing a little coke - but all of that is just the outward patina, the 
defence you put up while you try and figure out exactly what's happening with your life. It's 
like a mirror - what you use to reflect sunlight back into the eyes of teachers and parents, 
hoping to confuse them before they can confuse you even more than you already are. At 
heart, most high school kids are about as funky as a bunch of Republican bankers at a church 
social. There are girls who might have every album Black Sabbath ever made, but if Ozzy 
Osbourne went to their school and asked one of them for a date, that girl (and all of her 
friends) would laugh herself into a haemorrhage at the very idea. 
With his acne and pimples gone, Arnie looked okay - in fact, he looked more than okay. 
But there wasn't a girl who had gone to school with him when his face was at its running 
worst that would go out with him, I guessed. They didn't really see him the way he was now; 
they saw a memory of him. But Leigh was different. Because she was a transfer, she had no 
idea of how really gross Arnie had looked his first three years at LHS. Of course she would if 
she got last year's Libertonian and took a look at the picture of the chess club, but oddly 
enough, that same Republican tendency would almost surely make her disregard it. What's 
now is for ever - ask any Republican banker and he'll tell you that's just the way the world 
ought to run. 
High school kids and Republican bankers when you're little you take it for granted that 
everything changes constantly. When you're a grown-up, you take it for granted that things 
are going to change no matter how much you try to maintain the status quo (even Republican 
bankers know that - they may not like it, but they know it). It's only when you're a teenager 
that you talk about change constantly and believe in your heart that it never really happens. 
I went outside with my gigantic bag lunch in one hand and angled across the parking lot 
toward the shop building. It is a long, barnlike structure with corrugated metal sides painted 
blue - not very different in design from Will Darnell's garage, but much neater. It houses the 
wood shop, the auto shop, and the graphic arts department. Supposedly the smoking area is 
around at the rear, but on nice days during the lunch break, there are usually shoppies lined</p>
      <p class="calibre3">up along both sides of the building with their motorcycle boots or their pointy-toed Cuban 
shitkickers cocked up against the building, smoking and talking to their girlfriends. Or feeling 
them up. 
Today there was nobody at all along the right side of the building, and that should have told 
me something was up, but it didn't. I was lost in my own amusing thoughts about Arnie and 
Leigh and the psychology of the Modern American High School Student. 
The real smoking area - the 'designated' smoking area is in a small cul-de-sac behind the 
auto shop. And beyond the shops, fifty or sixty yards away, is' the football field, dominated 
with the big electric scoreboard with GO GET THEM TERRIERS emblazoned across the top. 
There was a group of people just beyond the smoking area, twenty or thirty of them in a 
tight little circle. That pattern usually means a fight or what Arnie likes to call a 'pushy-pushy' 
- two guys who aren't really mad enough to fight sort of shoving each other around and 
whacking each other on the shoulders and trying to protect their macho reputations. 
I glanced that way, but with no real interest. I didn't want to watch a fight; I wanted to eat 
my lunch and find out if anything was going on between Arnie and Leigh Cabot. If there was 
a little something happening there, it might take his mind off his obsession with Christine. 
One thing was for sure: Leigh Cabot didn't have 'any rust on her rocker panels. 
Then some girl screamed and someone else yelled,' Hey, no! Put that away, man!' That 
sounded very much ungood. I changed direction to see what was going on. 
I pushed my way through the crowd and saw Arnie in the circle, standing with his hands 
held out a little in front of him at chest level. He looked pale and scared, but not quite 
panicked. A little distance to his left was his lunch-sack, squashed flat. There was a large 
sneaker-print in the middle of it. Standing opposite him, in jeans and a white Hanes T-shirt 
that clung to every ripple and bulge of his chest, was Buddy Repperton. He had a switchblade 
knife in his right hand and he was moving it slowly back and forth in front of his face like a 
magician making mystic passes. 
He was tall and broad-shouldered. His hair was long and black. He wore it tied back in a 
ponytail with a hank of rawhide. His face was heavy and stupid and mean-looking. He was 
smiling just a little. What I felt was an unmanning mixture of dismay and cold fear. He didn't 
look just stupid and mean; he looked crazy. 
'Told you I was gonna getcha, man,' he said softly to Arnie. He tilted the knife and jabbed 
softly at the air with it in Arnie's direction. Arnie flinched back a little. The switchblade had 
an ivory handle with a little chrome button to flick out the blade set into it. The blade itself 
looked to be about eight inches long - it wasn't a knife at all, it was a fucking bayonet. 
'Hey, Buddy, brand im!' Don Vandenberg yelled happily, and I felt my mouth go dry.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">I looked around at the kid next to me, some nerdy freshman I didn't know. He looked 
absolutely hypnotised, all eyes. 'Hey,' I said, and when he didn't look around I slammed my 
elbow into his side. 'Hey!' 
He jumped and looked around at me in terror 
'Go get Mr Casey. He eats his lunch in the wood-shop office. Go get him right now.' 
Repperton glanced at me, then glanced at Arnie. 'Come on, Cunningham,' he said. 'What do 
you say, you want to go for it?' 
'Put down the knife and I will, you shitter,' Arnie said. His voice was perfectly calm. 
Shitter, where had I heard that word before? From George LeBay, hadn't it been? Sure. It had 
been his brother's word. 
It apparently wasn't a word Repperton cared for. He flushed and stepped closer to Arnie. 
Arnie circled away. I thought something was going to happen pretty quick maybe one of 
those things the call for stitches and leave a scar. 
'You go get Casey now,' I told the nerdy-looking freshman, and he went. But I thought 
everything would probably go down before Mr Casey got back . . . unless I could maybe slow 
things down a little. 
'Put down the knife, Repperton,' I said. 
His glance came over my way again. 'Whit you know,' he said. 'It's Cuntface's friend, You 
want to make me put it down?' 
'You've got a knife and he doesn't, I said. 'In my book that makes you a fucking chicken-
shit.' 
The flush deepened. Now his concentration was broken. He looked at Arnie, then over at 
me. Arnie flashed me a glance of pure gratitude - and moved a little closer to Repperton. I 
didn't like that. 
'Put it down,' someone yelled at Repperton. And then someone else: 'Put it down!' They 
started to chant: 'Put it down, put it down, put it down!' 
Repperton didn't like it. He didn't mind being the centre of attention, but this was the wrong 
sort of attention. His glance began to flicker around nervously, first at Arnie, then at me, then 
at the others. A hank of hair fell across his forehead, and he tossed it back. 
When he looked my way again, I made a move as if to go for him. The knife swivelled in 
my direction, and Arnie moved - he moved faster than I would have believed. He brought the 
side of his right hand down in a half-assed but effective karate chop. He hit Repperton's wrist 
hard and knocked the knife out of his hand. It clattered onto the butt-littered hottop. 
Repperton bent and grabbed for it. Arnie timed it with a deadly accuracy and when</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Repperton's hand came all the wav to the asphalt, Arnie stamped on it. Hard. Repperton 
screamed. 
Don Vandenberg moved in then, quickly, hauled Arnie off, and threw him to the ground. 
Hardly aware that I was going to do it, I stepped into the ring and kicked Vandenberg in the 
ass just as hard as I could - I brought my foot up rather than pistoning it out; I kicked him as 
if I were punting a football. 
Vandenberg, a tall, thin guy who was either nineteen or twenty at that time, began to 
scream and dance around holding his butt. He forgot all about helping his Buddy; he ceased 
to be a factor in things. To me it's amazing that I didn't paralyse him. I never kicked anyone 
or anything harder, and my friend, it sho' did feel fine. 
Just then an arm locked itself around my windpipe and there was a hand between my legs. I 
realised what was going to happen just a second too late to wholly prevent it. My balls were 
given a good, firm squeeze that sent sick pain bellowing and raving up from my crotch and 
into my stomach and down into my legs, unmanning them so that when the arm around my 
windpipe let go. I simply collapsed in a puddle on the smoking-area tarmac. 
'How did you like that, dickface?' a squarish guy with bad teeth asked me. He was wearing 
small and rather delicate wire-frame glasses that looked absurd on his wide, blocky face. This 
was Moochie Welch, another of Buddy's friends. 
Suddenly the circle of watchers began to melt away and I heard a man's voice yelling, 
'Break it up! Break it up right now! You kids take a walk! Take a walk, dammit!' 
It was Mr Casey. Finally, Mr Casey. 
Buddy Repperton snatched his switchblade off the pavement. He retracted the blade and 
shoved the knife into the hip pocket of his jeans in one quick motion. His hand was scraped 
and bleeding, and it looked as if it was going to swell. The miserable sonofabitch, I hoped it 
would swell ,until it looked like one of those gloves Donald Duck wears in the funnypages. 
Moochie Welch backed away from me, glanced toward the sound of Mr Casey's voice, and 
touched the corner of his mouth delicately with his thumb. 'Later, dickface,' he said. 
Don Vandenberg was dancing more slowly now, but he was still rubbing the affected part. 
Tears of pain were spilling down his face 
Then Arnie was beside me, getting an arm around me, helping me up. There was a lot of 
dirt smeared across his shirt from where Vandenberg had thrown him down. There were 
cigarette butts squashed into the knees of his jeans. 
'You okay, Dennis? What'd he do to you?' 
'Gave my balls a little squeeze. I'll be all right.'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">At least I hoped I would be. If you're a man and you've slammed your nuts a good one at 
some point (and what man has not), you know. If you're a woman, you don't - can't. The 
initial agony is only the start; it fades, to be replaced by a dull, throbbing feeling of pressure 
that coils in the pit of the stomach. And what that feeling says is Hi, there! Good to be here, 
just sitting around in the pit of your stomach and making you feel like you're going to 
simultaneously blow lunch and shit your pants! I guess I'll just hang around for a while, 
okay? How does half an hour or so sound? Great! Getting your nuts squeezed is not one of 
life's great thrills. 
Mr Casey shoved his wav through the loosening knot of spectators and took in the situation. 
He wasn't a big guy like Coach Puffer; he didn't even look particularly rugged. He was of 
medium height and age, and going bald. Big horn-rimmed glasses sat squarely on his face. He 
favoured plain white shirts - no tie - and he was wearing one of them now. He wasn't a big 
guy, but Mr Casey got respect. Nobody fucked around with him, because he wasn't afraid of 
kids deep down the way so many teachers are. The kids knew it, too. Buddy and Don and 
Moochie knew it; it was in the sullen way they dropped their eyes and shuffled their feet. 
'Get lost,' Mr Casey said briskly to the few remaining spectators. They started to drift away. 
Moochie Welch decided to try and drift with them. 'Not you, Peter,' Mr Casey said. 
'Aw, Mr Casey, I ain't been doing nothing,' Moochie said. 
'Me neither,' Don said. 'How come you always pick on, us?' 
Mr Casey came over to where I was still leaning on Arnie' for support. 'Are you all right, 
Dennis?' 
I was finally beginning to get over it - I wouldn't have been if one of my thighs hadn't 
partially blocked Welch's hand. I nodded. 
Mr Casey walked back to where Buddy Repperton, Moochie Welch, and Don Vandenberg 
stood in a shuffling, angry line. Don hadn't been joking; he had been speaking for all of them. 
They really did feel picked on. 
'This is cute, isn't it?' Mr Casey said finally. 'Three on two. That the way you like to do 
things, Buddy? Those odds don't seem stacked enough for you.' 
Buddy looked up, threw Casey a smouldering, ugly glance, and then dropped his eyes 
again. 'They started it. Those guys.' 
'That's not true - 'Arnie began. 
'Shut up, cuntface,' Buddy said. He started to add something, but before he could get it out, 
Mr Casey grabbed him and threw him up against the back wall of the shop. There was a tin 
sign there which read SMOKING HERE ONLY. Mr Casey began to slam Buddy Repperton 
against that sign, and every time he did it, the sign jangled, like dramatic punctuation. He 
handled Repperton the way you or I might have handled a great big ragdoll. I guess he had 
muscles somewhere, all right.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'You want to shut your big mouth,' he said, and slammed Buddy against the sign. 'You want 
to shut your mouth or clean up your mouth. Because I don't have to listen to that stuff coming 
from you, Buddy.' 
He let go of Repperton's shirt. It had pulled out of his jeans, showing his white, untanned 
belly. He looked back at Arnie. 'What were you saying?' 
'I came past the smoking area on my way out to the bleachers to eat my lunch,' Arnie said. 
'Repperton was smoking with his friends there. He came over and knocked my lunchbag out 
of my hand and then stepped on it. He squashed it.' He seemed about to say something more, 
struggled with it, and swallowed it again. 'That started the fight.' 
But I wasn't going to leave it at that. I'm no stoolie or tattletale, not under ordinary 
circumstances, but Repperton had apparently decided that more than a good beating was 
required to avenge himself for getting kicked out of Darnell's. He could have punched a hole 
in Arnie's intestines, maybe killed him. 
'Mr Casey,' I said. 
He looked at me. Behind him, Buddy Repperton's green eyes flashed at me balefully - a 
warning. Keep your mouth shut, this is between us. Even a year before, some twisted sense of 
pride might have forced me to go along with him and play the game, but not now. 
'What is it, Dennis?' 
'He's had it in for Arnie since the summmer. He's got a knife, and he looked like he was 
planning to stick it in.' 
Arnie was looking at me, his grey eyes opaque and unreadable. I thought about him calling 
Repperton a shitter - LeBay's word - and felt a prickle of goosebumps on my back. 
'You fucking liar!' Repperton cried dramatically. 'I ain't got no knife!' 
Casey looked at him without saying anything. Vandenberg and Welch looked extremely 
uncomfortable now - scared. Their possible punishment for this little scuffle had progressed 
beyond detention, which they were used to, and suspension, which they had experienced, 
toward the outer limits of expulsion. 
I only had to say one more word. I thought about it. I almost didn't. But it had been Arnie, 
and Arnie was my friend, and inside where it mattered, I didn't just think he had meant to 
stick Arnie with that blade; I knew it. I said the word. 
'It's a switchblade.' 
Now Repperton's eyes did not just flash; they blazed, promising hellfire, damnation, and a 
long period in traction. 'That's bullshit, Mr Casey,' he said hoarsely. 'He's lying. I swear to 
God.' 
Mr Casey still said nothing. He looked slowly at Arnie.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'Cunningham,' he said. 'Did Repperton here pull a knife on you?' 
Arnie wouldn't answer at first. Then in a low voice that was little more than a sigh, he said, 
'Yeah.' 
Now Repperton's blazing glance was for both of us. 
Casey turned to Moochie Welch and Don Vandenberg. All at once I could see that his 
method of handling this had changed he had begun to move slowly and carefully, as if testing 
the footing beneath carefully each time he moved a step forward. Mr Casey had already 
grasped the consequences. 
'Was there a knife involved?' he asked them. 
Moochie and Vandenberg looked at their feet and would not answer. That was answer 
enough. 
'Turn out your pockets, Buddy,' Mr Casey said. 
'Fuck I will!' Buddy said. His voice went shrill. 'You can't make me!' 
'If you mean I don't have the authority, you're wrong,' Mr Casey said. 'If you mean I can't 
turn your pockets out for myself if I decide to try it, that's also wrong. But - ' 
'Yeah, try it,' Buddy shouted at him. 'I'll knock you through that wall, you little bald fuck!' 
My stomach was rolling helplessly. I hated stuff like this, ugly confrontation scenes, and 
this was the worst one I'd ever been a part of. 
But Mr Casey had things under control, and he never deviated from his course. 
'But I'm not going to do it,' he finished. 'You're going to turn out your pockets yourself.' 
'Fat fucking chance,' Buddy said. He was standing against the back wall of the shop so that 
the bulge in his hip pocket wouldn't show. His shirt-tail hung in two wrinkled flaps over the 
crotch of his jeans. His eyes darted here and there like the eyes of an animal brought to bay. 
Mr Casey glanced at Moochie and Don Vandenberg. You two boys go up to the office and 
stay there until I come up,' he said. 'Don't go anywhere else; you've got enough trouble 
without that.' 
They walked away slowly, close together, as if for protection. Moochie threw one glance 
back. In the main building the bell went off. People started to stream back inside: some of 
them giving us curious glances. We had missed lunch. It didn't matter. I wasn't hungry 
anymore. 
Mr Casey turned his attention back to Buddy.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'You're on school grounds right now,' he said. 'You should thank God you are, because if 
you do have a knife, Buddy, and if you pulled it, that's assault with a deadly weapon. They 
send you to prison for that.' 
'Prove it, prove it!' Buddy shouted. His cheeks were flaming, his breath coming in quick, 
nervous little gasps. 
'If you don't turn out your pockets right now, I'm going to write a dismissal slip on you. 
Then I'm going to call the cops and the minute you step outside the main gate, they'll grab 
you. You see the bind you're in?' He looked grimly at Buddy. 'We keep our own house here,' 
he said. 'But if I have to write you a dismissal, Buddy, your ass belongs to them. Of course if 
you have no knife, you're okay. But if you do and they find it . . .' 
There was a moment of silence. The four of us stood in tableau. I didn't think he was going 
to do it; he would take his dismissal and try to ditch the knife somewhere quickly. Then he 
must have realised that the cops would hunt for it and probably find it, because he pulled the 
knife out of his back pocket and threw it down on the tarmac. It landed on the go-button. The 
blade popped out and winked wickedly in the afternoon sunlight, eight inches of chromed 
steel. 
Arnie looked at it and wiped his mouth with the heel of his hand. 
'Go up to the office, Buddy,' Mr Casey said quietly. 'Wait until I get up there.' 
'Screw the office!' Buddy cried. His voice was thin and hysterical with anger. Hair had 
fallen across his forehead again, and he flipped it back. 'I'm getting out of this fucking pigsty.' 
'Yes, all right, fine,' Mr Casey said, with no more inflection or excitement in his voice than 
he would have shown if Buddy had offered him a cup of coffee. I knew then that Buddy was 
all finished at Libertyville High. No detention or three-day vacation; his parents would be 
receiving the stiff blue expulsion form in the mail - the form would explain why their son was 
being expelled and would inform them of their rights and legal options in the matter. 
Buddy looked at Arnie and me - and he smiled. 'I'll fix you,' he said. 'I'll get even. You'll 
wish you were never fucking born.' He kicked the knife away, spinning and flashing. It came 
to rest on the edge of the hottop, and Buddy walked off, the cleats on the heels of his 
motorcycle boots clicking and scraping. 
Mr Casey looked at us; his face was sad and tired. 'I'm sorry,' he said. 
'That's okay,' Arnie replied. 
'Do you boys want dismissal slips? I'll write them for you if you feet you'd like to go home 
for the rest of the day.' I glanced at Arnie, who was brushing off his shirt. He shook his head. 
'No, that's okay,' I said. 
'All right. Just late slips then.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">We went into Mr Casey's room and he wrote us late slips for our next class, which 
happened to be one we shared together - Advanced Physics. Coming into the physics lab, a 
lot of people looked at us curiously, and there was some whispering behind hands. 
The afternoon absence slip circulated at the end of period six. I checked it and saw the 
names Repperton, Vandenberg, and Welch, each with a (D) after his name. I thought that 
Arnie and I would be called to the office at the end of school to tell Ms Lothrop, the 
discipline officer, what had happened. But we weren't. 
I looked for Arnie after school, thinking we'd ride home together and talk it over a little, but 
I was wrong about that too. He'd already left for Darnell's Garage to work on Christine.</p>

I didn't get a chance to really talk to Arnie until after the football game the following 
Saturday. And that was also the first time since the day be had bought her that Christine was 
out on the street. 
The team went up to Hidden Hills, about sixteen miles away, on the quietest school-activity 
bus ride I've ever been on. We might have been going to the guillotine instead of to a football 
game. Even the fact that their record, 1-2, was only slightly better than ours, didn't cheer 
anybody up much. Coach Puffer sat in the seat behind the bus driver, pale and silent, as if he 
might be suffering from a hangover. 
Usually a trip to an away game was a combination caravan and circus. A second bus, 
loaded up with the cheerleaders, the band, and all the LHS kids who had signed up as 'rooters' 
('rooters', dear God! if we hadn't all been through high school, who the hell would believe 
it?), trundled along behind the team bus. Behind the two buses would be a line of fifteen or 
twenty cars, most of them full of teenagers, most with THUMP EM TERRIERS bumper 
stickers - beeping, flashing their lights, all that stuff you probably remember from your own 
high school days. 
But on this trip there was only the cheerleader/band bus (and that wasn't even full - in a 
winning year if you didn't sign up for the second bus by Tuesday, you were out of luck) and 
three or four cars behind that. The fair-weather friends had already bailed out. And I was 
sitting on the team bus next to Lenny Barongg, glumly wondering if I was going to get 
knocked out of my jock that afternoon, totally unaware that one of the few cars behind the 
bus today was Christine. 
I saw it when we got out of the bus in the Hidden Hills High School parking lot. Their band 
was already out on the field, and the thud from the big drum came clearly, oddly magnified 
under the lowering, cloudy sky. It was going to be the first really good Saturday for football, 
cool, overcast, and fallish. 
Seeing Christine parked beside the band bus was surprise enough, but when Arnie got out 
on one side and Leigh Cabot got out on the other, I was downright stunned - and more than a</p>
      <p class="calibre3">little jealous. She was wearing a clinging pair of brown woollen slacks and a white cableknit 
pullover, her blond hair spilling gorgeously over her shoulders. 
'Arnie,' I said. 'Hey, man!' 
'Hi, Dennis,' he said a little shyly. 
I was aware that some of the players getting off the bus were also doing double-takes; here 
was Pizza-Face Cunningham with the gorgeous transfer from Massachusetts. How in God's 
name did that happen? 
'How are you?' 
'Good,' he said, 'Do you know Leigh Cabot?, 
'From class,' I said. 'Hi, Leigh.' 
'Hi, Dennis. Are you going to win today?' 
I lowered my voice to a hoarse whisper. 'It's all been fixed. Bet your ass off.' 
Arnie blushed a little at that, but Leigh cupped her hand to her mouth and giggled. 
'We're going to try, but I don't know,' I said. 
'We'll root you on to victory,' Arnie said. 'I can see it in tomorrow's paper now - Guilder 
Becomes Airborne, Breaks Conference TD Record.' 
'Guilder Taken to Hospital with Fractured Skull, that's more likely,' I said. 'How many kids 
came up? Ten? Fifteen?' 
'More room on the bleachers for those of us that did,' Leigh said. She took Arnie's arm - 
surprising and pleasing him, I think. Already I liked her. She could have been a bitch or 
mentally fast asleep - it seems to me that a lot of really beautiful girls are one or the other - 
but she was neither. 
'How's the rolling iron?' I asked, and walked over to the car. 
'Not too bad.' He followed me over, trying not to grin too widely. 
The work had progressed, and now there was enough done on the Fury so that it didn't look 
quite so crazy and helter-skelter. The other half of the old, rusted front grille had been 
replaced, and the nest of cracks in the windscreen was tot ally gone. 
'You replaced the windscreen,' I said. 
Arnie nodded. 
'And the bonnet.'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">The bonnet was clean; brand-spanking new, in sharp contrast to the rust-flecked sides. It 
was a deep fire-engine red. Sharp-looking. Arnie touched it possessively, and the touch 
turned into a caress. 
'Yeah. I put that on myself. 
Something about that jagged on me. He had done it all himself, hadn't he? 
'You said you were going to turn it into a showpiece,' I said. 'I think I'm starting to believe 
you.' I walked around to the driver's side. The upholstery on the insides of the doors and floor 
was still dirty and scuffed up, but now the front seat cover had been replaced as well as the 
back one. 
'It's going to be beautiful,' Leigh said, but there was a flat note in her voice - it wasn't as 
naturally bright and effervescent as it had been when we were talking about the game - and 
that made me glance at her. A glance was all it took. She didn't like Christine. I realized it 
just like that completely and absolutely, as if I had plucked one of her brainwaves out of the 
air. She would try to like the car because she liked Arnie. But . . . she wasn't ever going to 
really like it. 
'So you got it street-legal,' I said. 
'Well . . .' Arnie looked uncomfortable. 'It isn't. Quite.' 
'What do you mean?' 
'The horn doesn't work, and sometimes the tail-lights go out when I step on the brake. It's a 
dead short somewhere, I think, but so far I haven't been able to chase it out.' 
I glanced at the new windscreen - there was a new inspection sticker on it, Arnie followed 
my glance and managed to look both embarrassed and a bit truculent at the same time. 'Will 
gave me my sticker. He knows it's ninety per cent there.' And besides, I thought, you had this 
hot date, right? 
'It's not dangerous, is it?' Leigh asked, addressing the question somewhere between Arnie 
and me. Her brow had creased slightly - I think maybe she sensed a sudden cold current 
between Arnie and me. 
'No,' I said. 'I don't think so. When you ride with Arnie you're riding with the original Old 
Creeping Jesus anyway.' 
That broke the odd little pocket of tension that had built up. From the playing field there 
was a discordant shriek of brass, and then the band instructor's voice, carrying to us, thin but 
perfectly clear under the low sky: 'Again, please! This is Rodgers and Hammerstein, not rock 
and ro-ool! Again, please!' 
The three of us looked at each other. Arnie and I started to laugh, and after a moment Leigh 
joined in. Looking at her, I felt that momentary jealousy again. I wanted nothing but the best</p>
      <p class="calibre3">for my friend Arnie, but she was really something - seventeen going on eighteen, gorgeous, 
perfect, healthy, alive to everything in her world. Roseanne was beautiful in her way, but 
Leigh made Roseanne look like a tree-sloth taking a nap. 
Was that when I started to want her? When I started to want my best friend's girl? Yeah, I 
suppose it was. But I swear to you, I never would have put a move on her if things had 
happened differently. I just don't think they were meant to happen differently. Or maybe I just 
have to feel that way. 
We better go, Arnie, or we won't get a good seat in the visitors' bleachers,' Leigh said with 
ladylike sarcasm. 
Arnie smiled. She was still holding his arm lightly, and he looked rather bowled over by it 
all. Why not? If it had been me, having my first experience with a live girl, and one as pretty 
as Leigh, I would have been three-quarters to being in love with her already. I wished him 
nothing but well with her. I guess I want you to believe that, even if you don't believe 
anything else I have to tell you from here on out. If anyone deserved a little happiness, it was 
Arnie. 
The rest of the team had gone into the visitors' dressing rooms at the back of the 
gymnasium wing of the school, and now Coach Puffer poked his head out. 
'Do you think you could favour us with your presence, Mr Guilder?' he called. 'I know it's a 
lot to ask, and I hope you'll forgive me if you had something more important to do, but if you 
don't, would you get your tail down into this locker room?' 
I muttered to Arnie and Leigh, 'This is Rodgers and Hammerstein, not rock and ro-ool,' and 
trotted toward the building. 
I walked toward the dressing rooms - Coach had popped back inside - and Arnie and Leigh 
started across to the bleachers. Halfway to the doors I stopped and went back to Christine. 
Late to suit up or not, I approached her in a circle; that absurd prejudice against walking in 
front of the car still held. 
On the rear end I saw a Pennsylvania dealer plate held on with a spring. I flipped it down 
and saw a Dymo tape stuck to the back side: THIS PLATE PROPERTY OF DARNELL'S 
GARAGE,  LIBERTYVILLE, PA. 
I let the plate snap back and stood up, frowning. Darnell had given him a sticker while his 
car was still a ways from being street-legal; Darnell had loaned him a dealer plate so he could 
use the car to bring Leigh to the game. Also, he had stopped being 'Darnell' to Arnie; today 
he had called him 'Will'. Interesting, but not very comforting. 
I wondered if Arnie was dumb enough to think that the Will Darnells of this world ever did 
favours out of the goodness of their hearts. I hoped he wasn't, but I wasn't sure. I wasn't sure 
of much about Arnie anymore. He had changed a lot in the last few weeks.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">We surprised the hell out of ourselves and won the game - as it turned out, that was one of 
only two we won that whole season . . . not that I was with the team when the season ended. 
We had no right to win; we went out on the field feeling like losers, and we lost the toss. 
The Hillmen (dumb name for a team, but what's so bright about being known as the Terriers 
when you get right down to it?) went forty yards on their first two plays, going through our 
defensive line like cheese through a goose. Then, on the third play - their third first-and-ten in 
a row - their quarterback coughed up the ball. Gary Tardiff grabbed it up and rambled sixty 
yards for the score, a great big grin on his face. 
The Hillmen and their coach went bananas protesting that the ball had been dead at the line 
of scrimmage, but the officials disagreed and we led 6-0. From my place on the bench I was 
able to look across at the visitors' bleachers and could see that the few Libertyville fans there 
were going crazy. I guess they had a right to; it was the first time we'd led in a game all 
season. Arnie and Leigh were waving Terriers pennants. I waved at them. Leigh saw me, 
waved back, then elbowed Arnie. He waved back too. They looked as if they were getting 
pretty chummy up there, which made me grin. 
As for the game, we never looked back after that first flukey score. We had that mystic 
thing, momentum, on our side - maybe for the only time that year. I didn't break the 
Conference touchdown record as Arnie had predicted, but I scored three times, one of them 
on a ninety-yard runback, the longest I ever made. At halftime it was 17-0, and Coach was a 
new man. He saw a complete turnaround ahead of us, the greatest comeback in the history of 
the Conference. Of course that turned out to be a fool's dream, but he surely was excited that 
day, and I felt good for him, as I had for Arnie and Leigh, getting to know each other so 
profitably and easily. 
The second half was not so good; our defence resumed the mostly prone posture it had 
assumed in our first three games, but it was still never really close. We won 27-18. 
Coach had taken me out halfway through the fourth quarter to put in Brian McNally, who 
would be replacing me next year - actually even earlier than that, as it turned out. I showered 
and changed up, then came back out just as the two-minute warning went off. 
The parking lot was full of cars but empty of people. Wild cheering came from the field as 
the Hillmen fans urged their team to do the impossible in the last two minutes of play. From 
this distance it all seemed as unimportant as it undoubtedly was' 
I walked over toward Christine. 
There she sat with her rust-flecked sides and her new bonnet and her tailfins that seemed a 
thousand miles along. A dinosaur from the dark ditty-bop days of the '50s when all the oil 
millionaires were from Texas and the Yankee dollar was kicking the shit out of the Japanese 
yen instead of the other way around. Back in the days when Carl Perkins was singing about 
pink pedal pushers and Johnny Horton was singing about dancing all night on a honky-tonk 
hardwood floor and the biggest teen idol in the country was Edd 'Kookie' Byrnes.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">I touched Christine. I tried to caress it as Arnie had done, to like it for Arnie's sake as Leigh 
had done. Surely if anyone should be able to make himself like it, it should be me. Leigh had 
only known Arnie a month. I had known him my whole life. 
I slipped my hand along the rusty surface and I thought of George LeBay, and Veronica and 
Rita LeBay, and somewhere along the line the hand that was supposed to be caressing closed 
into a fist and I suddenly slammed it down on Christine's flank as hard as I could - plenty 
hard enough to hurt my hand and make myself utter a defensive little laugh and wonder what 
the hell I thought I was doing. 
The sound of rust sitting down onto the hottop in small flakes. 
The sound of a bass drum from the football field, like a giant's heartbeat. 
The sound of my own heartbeat. 
I tried the front door. 
It was locked. 
I licked my lips and realized I was scared. 
It was almost as if - this was very funny, this was hilarious - it was almost as if this car 
didn't like me, as if it suspected me of wanting to come between it and Arnie, and that the 
reason I didn't want to walk in front of it was because - 
I laughed again and then remembered my dream and stopped laughing. This was too much 
like it for comfort. It wasn't Chubby McCarthy blaring over the PA, of course, not in Hidden 
Hills, but the rest of it brought on a dreamy, unpleasant sense of dej–∞ vu - the sound of the 
cheers, the sound of padded body contact, the wind hissing through trees that looked like 
cutouts under an overcast sky. 
The engine would gun. The car would lurch forward, drop back, lurch forward, drop back. 
And then the tyres would scream as it roared right at me - 
I shook the thought off. It was time to stop pandering to myself with all of this crazy shit. It 
was time - and overtime - to get my imagination under control. This was a car, not a she but 
an it, not really Christine at all but only a 1958 Plymouth Fury that had rolled off an assembly 
line in Detroit along with about four hundred thousand others. 
It worked . . . at least temporarily. Just to demonstrate how little afraid of it I was, I got 
down on my knees and looked under it. What I saw there was even crazier than the haphazard 
way the car was being rebuilt on top. There were three new Pleasurizer shocks, but the fourth 
was a dark, oil-caked ruin that looked as if it had been on there for ever. The exhaust was so 
new it was still silvery, but the silencer looked at least middle-aged and the header pipe was 
in very bad shape. Looking at the header, thinking about exhaust fumes that could leak into 
the car from it, made me flash on Veronica LeBay again. Because exhaust fumes can kill. 
They -</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'Dennis, what are you doing?' 
I guess I was still more uneasy than I thought, because I was up from my knees like a shot 
with my heart beating in my throat. It was Arnie. He looked cold and angry. 
Because I was looking at his car? Why should that make him mad? Good question. But it 
had, that was obvious. 
'I was looking over your mean machine,' I said, trying to sound casual. 'Where's Leigh?' 
'She had to go to the Ladies', he said, dismissing her. His grey eyes never left my face. 
'Dennis, you're the best friend I've got, the best friend I've ever had. You might have saved 
me a trip to the hospital the other day when Repperton pulled that knife, and I know it. But 
don't you go behind my back, Dennis. Don't you ever do that.' 
From the playing field there was a tremendous cheer the Hillmen had just made the final 
score of the game, with less than thirty seconds to play. 
'Arnie, I don't know what the hell you're talking about, I said, but I felt guilty. I felt guilty 
the way I had felt being introduced to Leigh, sizing her up, wanting her a little wanting the 
girl he so obviously wanted himself. But . . . going behind his back? Was that what I had 
been doing? 
I suppose he could have seen it that way. I had known that his irrational - interest, 
obsession, put it however you like - his irrational thing about the car was the locked room in 
the house of our friendship, the place I could not go without inviting all sorts of trouble. And 
if he hadn't caught me trying to jimmy the door, he had at least come upon me trying to peek 
through a keyhole. 
'I think you know exactly what I'm talking about.' he said, and I saw with a tired sort of 
dismay that he was not just a little mad; he was furious. 'You and my father and mother are 
all spying on me ‚Äúfor my own good‚Äù, that's the way it is, isn't it? They sent you down to 
Darnell's Garage, to snoop around, didn't they?' 
'Hey, Arnie, wait just a - ' 
'Boy, did you think I wouldn't find out? I didn't say anything then - because we're friends. 
But I don't know, Dennis. There has to be a line, and I think I'm drawing it. Why don't you 
just leave my car alone and stop butting in where you don't belong?' 
'First of all,' I said, 'it wasn't your father and your mother. Your father got me alone and 
asked me if I'd take a look at what you were doing with the car. I said sure I would, I was 
curious myself. Your dad has always been okay to me. What was I supposed to say?' 
'You were supposed to say no.' 
'You don't get it. He's on your side. Your mother still hopes it doesn't come to anything - 
that was the idea I got - but Michael really hopes you get it running. He said so.'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'Sure, that's the way he'd come on to you.' He was almost sneering. 'Really all he's 
interested in is making sure I'm still hobbled. That's what they're both interested in. They 
don't want me to grow up because then they'd have to face getting old.' 
'That's too hard, man.' 
'Maybe you think so. Maybe coming from a halfway-normal family makes you soft in the 
head, Dennis. They offered me a new car for high school graduation, did you know that? All I 
had to do was give up Christine, make all A's, and agree to go to Horlicks . . . where they 
could keep me in direct view for another four years.' 
I didn't know what to say. That was pretty crass, all right. 
'So just butt out of it, Dennis. That's all I'm saying. We'll both be better off.' 
'I didn't tell him anything, anyhow,' I said. 'Just that you were doing a few things here and 
there. He seemed sort of relieved.' 
'Yeah, I'll bet.' 
'I didn't have any idea it was as close to street-legal as it is. But it isn't all the way yet. I 
looked underneath, and that header pipe's a mess. I hope you're driving with your windows 
open.' 
'Don't tell me how to drive it! I know more about what makes cars run than you ever will!' 
That was when I started to get pissed off at him. I didn't like it - I didn't want to have an 
argument with Arnie, especially not now, when Leigh would be joining him in another 
moment - but I could feel somebody upstairs in the brain-room starting to pull those red 
switches, one by one. 
'That's probably true,' I said, controlling my voice. 'But I'm not sure how much you know 
about people. Will Darnell gave you an improper sticker - if you got picked up he could lose 
his state inspection certificate. He gave you a dealer plate. Why did he do those things, 
Arnie?' 
For the first time Arnie seemed defensive. 'I told you. He knows I'm doing the work.' 
'Don't be a numbskull. That guy wouldn't give a crippled crab a crutch unless there was 
something in it for him, and you know it.' 
'Dennis, will you leave it alone, for God's sake?' 
'Man,' I said, stepping toward him, 'I don't give a fuck if you have a car. I just don't want 
you in a bind over it. Sincerely.' 
He looked at me uncertainly. 
'I mean, what are we yelling at each other about? Because I looked underneath your car to 
see how the exhaust-pipe was hanging?'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">But that hadn't been all I was doing. Some . . . but not quite all. And I think we both knew 
it. 
On the playing field, the final gun went off with a flat bang. A slight drizzle had started to 
come down, and it was getting cold. We turned toward the sound of the gun and saw Leigh 
coming toward us, carrying her pennant and Arnie's. She waved. We waved back. 
'Dennis, I can take care of myself,' he said. 
'Okay,' I said simply. 'I hope you can.' Suddenly I wanted to ask him how deep he was in 
with Darnell. And that was a question I couldn't ask; that would bring on an even more bitter 
argument. Things would be said that could maybe never be repaired. 
'I can,' he repeated. He touched his car, and the hard took in his eyes softened. 
I felt a mixture of relief and dismay - the relief because we weren't going to have a fight 
after all; we had both managed to avoid saying anything completely irreparable. But it also 
seemed to me that it wasn't just one room of our friendship that had been closed off; it was a 
whole damn wing. He had rejected what I'd had to say with complete totality and had made 
the conditions for continuing the friendship pretty clear: everything will be okay as long as 
you do it my way. 
Which was also his parents' attitude, if only he could have seen it. But then, I suppose he 
had to learn it somewhere. 
Leigh came up, drops of rain gleaming in her hair. Her colour was high, her eyes sparkling 
with good health and good excitement. She exuded a. naive and untested sexuality that made 
me feet a little light-headed. Not that I was the main object of her attention; Arnie was. 
'How did it end?' Arnie asked. 
'Twenty-seven to eighteen,' she said, and then added gleefully, 'We destroyed them. Where 
were you two?' 
'Just talking cars,' I said, and Arnie shot me an amused glance - at least his sense of humour 
hadn't disappeared with his common sense. And I thought there was some cause for hope in 
the way he looked at her. He was falling for her, head over heels. The tumble was slow right 
now, but it would almost surely speed up if things went right. I was really curious about how 
it had happened, the two of them getting together. Arnie's complexion had cleared up and he 
looked pretty good, but in a rather bookish, bespectacled sort of way. He wasn't the sort of 
guy you'd have expected Leigh Cabot to want to be with; you'd expect her to be hanging from 
the arm of the American high school version of Apollo. 
People were streaming back across the field now, our players and theirs, our fans and theirs. 
'Just talking cars,' Leigh repeated, mocking softly. She turned her face up to Arnie's and 
smiled. He smiled back, a sappy, dopey smile that did my heart a world of good. I could tell, 
just looking at him, that whenever Leigh smiled at him that way, Christine was the farthest</p>
      <p class="calibre3">thing from his mind; she was demoted back to her proper place as an it, a means of 
transportation. 
I liked that just fine.</p>

O Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes-Benz?

I must make amends . . . 
      - Janis Joplin 
 
I saw Arnie and Leigh in the halls a lot over the first 6 weeks in October, first leaning 
against his locker or hers, talking before the home-room bell; then holding hands; then going 
out after school with their arms around each other. It had happened. In high school parlance, 
they were 'going together'. I thought it was more than that. I thought they were in love. 
I hadn't seen Christine since the day we beat Hidden Hills. She had apparently gone back to 
Darnell's for more work - maybe that was part of the agreement Arnie had struck with 
Darnell when Darnell issued the dealer plate and the illegal sticker that day. I didn't see the 
Fury, but I saw a lot of Leigh and Arnie . . . and heard a lot about them ' They were a hot item 
of school gossip. Girls wanted to know what she saw in him, for heaven's sake; boys, always 
more practical and prosaic, only wanted to know if my runt friend had managed to get into 
her pants. I didn't care about either of those things, but I did wonder from time to time what 
Regina and Michael thought of their son's extreme case of first love. 
One Monday in mid-October, Arnie and I ate our lunch together on the bleachers by the 
football field, as we had been Tanning to do on the day Buddy Repperton had pulled the knife 
- Repperton had indeed been expelled for that. Moochie and Don had gotten three-day 
vacations. They were currently being pretty good boys. And, in the not-so-sweet meanwhile, 
the football team had been run over twice more. Our record was now 1-5, and Coach Puffer 
had lapsed back into morose silence. 
My lunchbag wasn't as full as it had been on the day of Repperton and the knife; the only 
virtue I could see of being 1-5 was that we were now so far behind the Bears of Ridge Rock 
(they were 5-0-1) that it would be impossible for us to do anything in the Conference unless 
their team bus went over a cliff. 
We sat in the mellow October sunshine - the time for the little spooks in their bedsheets and 
rubber masks and Woolworth's Darth Vader costumes wasn't far off - munching and not 
saving too much. Arnie had a devilled egg and swapped it for one of my cold meatloaf 
sandwiches. Parents know very little about the secret lives of their children, I guess. Every 
Monday since first grade, Regina Cunningham had put a devilled egg in Arnie's lunchbag, 
and every day after we had a meatloaf dinner (which was usually Sunday suppers), I had a 
cold meatloaf sandwich in mine. Now I have always hated cold meatloaf and Arnie has 
always hated devilled eggs, although I never saw him turn one down done any other way. 
And I've often wondered what our mothers would think if they knew how few of the</p>
      <p class="calibre3">hundreds of devilled eggs and dozens of cold meatloaf sandwiches that went into our 
respective lunch-sacks had actually been eaten by him for whom each was intended. 
I got down to my cookies and Arnie got down to his fig-bars. He glanced over at me to 
make sure I was watching and then crammed all six fig-bars into his mouth at once and 
crunched down on them. His cheeks puffed out grotesquely. 
'Oh, Jesus, what a gross-out!' I cried. 
'Ung-ung-gooth-ung,' Arnie replied. 
I started to poke my fingers at his sides, where he's always been extremely ticklish, 
screaming 'Side-noogies! Look out, Arnie, I got side-noogies onya!' 
Arnie started to laugh, spraying out little wads of munched-up fig-bars. I know how 
obnoxious that must sound, but it was really funny. 
'Quit it, Dennith!' Arnie said, his mouth still full of fig-bars. 
'What was that? I can't understand you, you fucking barbarian.' I kept poking my fingers at 
him, giving him what we used to call 'side-noogies' when we were little kids (for some reason 
now lost in the sands of time), and he kept wiggling and twisting and laughing. 
He swallowed mightily, then belched. 
'You're so fucking gross, Cunningham,' I said. 
'I know.' He seemed really pleased by it. Probably was so far as I know, he'd never pulled 
the six-fig-bars-at-once trick in front of anyone else. If he had done it in front of his parents, I 
figure Regina would have had a kitty and Michael possibly a brain-haemorrhage. 
'What's the most you ever did?' I asked him. 
'I did twelve once,' he said. 'But I thought I was going to choke.' 
I snorted laughter. 'Have you done it for Leigh yet?' 
'I'm holding it back for the prom,' he said. 'I'll give her a few side-noggies too.' We got 
laughing over that, and I realized how much I missed Arnie sometimes - I had football, 
student council, a new girlfriend who would (I hoped) consent to give me a hand-job before 
the drive-in season ended. I had little hope of getting her to do more than that; she was a little 
too enchanted with herself. Still, it was fun trying. 
Even with all of that going on, I had missed Arnie. First there had been Christine, now there 
was Leigh and Christine. In that order, I hoped. 
'Where is she today?' I asked. 
'Sick,' he said. 'She got her period, and I guess it really hurts.'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">I raised a set of mental eyebrows. If she was discussing her female problems with him, they 
were getting chummy indeed. 
'How did you happen to ask her to the football game that day?' I asked. 'The day we played 
Hidden Hills?' 
He laughed. 'The only football game I've been to since my sophomore year. We brought 
you luck, Dennis.' 
'You just called her up and asked her to go?' 
'I almost didn't. That was the first date I ever had.' He glanced over at me shyly. 'I don't 
think I slept more than two hours the night before. After I called her up and she said she'd go 
with me, I was scared to death I'd make an, asshole of myself, or that Buddy Repperton 
would show up and want to fight, or something else would happen.' 
'You seemed to have everything under control.' 
'Did I? 'He looked pleased. 'Well, that's good. But I was scared. She'd talk to me in the 
halls, you know - ask me about assignments and stuff like that. She joined the chess club 
even though she wasn't very good . . . but she's getting better. I'm teaching her.' 
I'll bet you are, you dog, I thought, but didn't quite dare say it - I still remembered the way 
he had blown up at me that same day at Hidden Hills. Besides, I wanted to hear this. I was 
pretty curious; captivating a girl as stunning as Leigh Cabot had been a real coup. 
'So after a while I started to think maybe she was  interested in me,' Arnie went on. 'It 
probably took a lot longer for the penny to drop for me than it would for some other guys - 
guys like you, Dennis.' 
'Sure, I'm a smoothie,' I said. 'What James Brown used to call ‚Äúa sex machine.‚Äù' 
'No, you're no sex machine, but you know about girls,' he said seriously. 'You understand 
them. I was always just scared of them. Never knew what to say. Still don't, I guess. Leigh's 
different. 
'I was afraid to ask her out.' He seemed to consider this. 'I mean, she's a beautiful girl, really 
beautiful. Don't you think so, Dennis?' 
'Yes. As far as I can tell, she's the prettiest girl in school.' 
He smiled, pleased. 'I think so, too . . . but I thought, maybe it's only because I love her that 
I think that way.' 
I looked at my friend, hoping he wasn't going to get into more trouble than he could handle. 
At that point, of course, I had no idea what trouble meant. 
'Anyway, I heard these two guys talking one day in chem lab - Lenny Barongg and Ned 
Stroughman - and Ned was telling Lenny that he'd asked her out and she'd said no, but in a</p>
      <p class="calibre3">nice way . . . like maybe if he asked her again she might try it out. And I had this picture of 
her going steady with Ned by spring, and I started to feel really jealous. It's ridiculous. I 
mean, she told him no and I'm feeling jealous, you dig what I'm saying?' 
I smiled and nodded. Out on the field the cheerleaders were trying out some new routines. I 
didn't think they would help our team very much, but it was pleasant to watch them. Their 
shadows puddled at their heels on the green grass in the bright noontime. 
 
'The other thing that got me was that Ned didn't sound pissed off or . . . or ashamed . . . or 
rejected, or anything like that. He tried for a date and got turned down, that was all. I decided 
I could do that, too. Still, when I called her up on the phone I was sweating all over. Man, 
that was bad. I kept imagining her laughing at me and saying something like, ‚ÄúMe go out with 
you, you little creep? You must be dreaming! I'm not that hard up yet!‚Äù' 
'Yeah,' I said. 'I can't figure out why she didn't.' 
He poked me in the stomach. 'Gut-noogies, Dennis! Make you puke!' 
'Never mind,' I said. 'Tell me the rest.' 
He shrugged. 'Not much else to tell. Her mother answered the phone when I called and said 
she'd get her. I heard the phone go clunking down on the table, and I almost hung up.' Arnie 
held up two fingers a quarter of an inch apart. 'I came this close to hanging up. No shit.' 
'I know the feeling,' I said, and I did - you worry about the laughter, you imagine the 
contempt to some degree or other, no matter if you're a football player or some pimply little 
four-eyed runt - but I don't think I could understand the degree to which Arnie must have felt 
it. What he had done had taken monumental courage. It's a small thing, a date, but in our 
society there are all sorts of charged forces swirling behind that simple concept - I mean, 
there are kids who go all the way through high school and never get up enough courage to ask 
a girl for a date. Never once, in all four years. And that isn't just one or two kids, it's lots of 
them. And there are lots of sad girls who never get asked. It's a shitty way to run things, when 
you stop to think about it. A lot of people get hurt. I could dimly imagine the naked terror 
Arnie must have felt, waiting for Leigh to come to the phone; the sense of dread amazement 
at the idea that he was not planning to ask just any girl out but the prettiest girl in school. 
'She answered,' Arnie went on. 'She said ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù and, man, I couldn't say anything. I tried 
and nothing came out but this little whistle of air. So she said ‚ÄúHello, who is this?‚Äù like it 
might be some kind of practical joke, you know, and I thought, This is ridiculous. If I can talk 
to her in the hall, I should be able to talk to her on the goddam phone, all she can say is no, I 
mean slid can't shoot me or anything if I ask her for a date. So I said hi, this is Arnie 
Cunningham, and she said hi, and blah-blah-blahdy-blah, bullshit-builshit-bullshit, and then I 
realized I didn't even know where the hell I wanted to ask her to go, and we're running out of 
things to say, pretty soon she's going to hang up. So I asked her the first thing I could think 
of, would she want to go to the football game on Saturday. She said she'd love to go, right off 
like that, like she had just been waiting for me to ask her, you know?'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'Probably she was.' 
'Yeah, maybe.' Arnie considered this, bemused. 
The bell rang, signifying five minutes to period five. Arnie and I got up. The cheerleaders 
trotted off the field, their little skirts flipping saucily. 
We climbed down the bleachers, tossed our lunchbags in one of the trash barrels painted 
with the school colours orange and black, talk about Halloween - and walked toward the 
school. 
Arnie was still smiling, recalling the way it had-worked itself out, that first time with Leigh. 
'Asking her to the game was sheer desperation.' 
'Thank a lot,' I said. 'That' s what I get for playing my heart out every Saturday afternoon, 
huh?' 
'You know what I mean. Then, after she said she'd go with me, I had this really horrible 
thought and called you remember?' 
Suddenly I did. He had called to ask me if that game was at home or away and had seemed 
absurdly crushed when I told him it was at Hidden Hills. 
'So there I was, I've got a date with the prettiest girl in school, I'm crazy about her, and it 
turns out to be an away game and my car's in Will's garage.' 
'You could have taken the bus.' 
'I know that now, but I didn't then. The bus always used to be full up a week before the 
game. I didn't know so many people would stop coming to the games if the team started 
losing.' 
'Don't remind me,' I said. 
'So I went to Will. I knew Christine could do it, but no way she was street-legal. I mean, I 
was desperate.' 
How desperate? I wondered coldly and suddenly. 
'And he came through for me. Said he understood how important it was, and if . . .' Arnie 
paused; seemed to consider. 'And that's the story of the big date,' he finished gracelessly. 
And if . . . 
But that wasn't my business, 
Be his eyes, my father had said. 
But I pushed that away too.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">We were walking past the smoking area now, deserted except for three guys and two girls, 
hurriedly finishing a joint. They had it in a makeshift matchbook roachclip, and the evocative 
odour of pot, so similar to the aroma of slowly burning autumn leaves, slipped into my 
nostrils. 
'Seen Buddy Repperton around?' I asked. 
'No,' he said. 'And don't want to. You?' 
I had seen him once, hanging out at Vandenberg's Happy Gas, an extra-barrel service 
station out on Route 22 in Monroeville. Don Vandenberg's dad owned it, and the place had 
been on the ragged edge of going bust ever since the Arab oil embargo in '73. Buddy hadn't 
seen me; I was just cruising by. 
'Not to talk to.' 
'You mean he can talk?' Arnie said with a scorn that wasn't like him. 'What a shitter.' 
I started. That word again. I thought about it, told myself what the fuck, and asked him 
where he had gotten that particular term. 
He looked at me thoughtfully. The second bell rang suddenly, braying out from the side of 
the building. We were going to be late to class, but right then I didn't care at all. 
'You remember that day I bought the car?' he said. 'Not the day I put the deposit on it, but 
the day I actually bought it?' 
'Sure.' 
'I went in with LeBay while you stayed outside. He had this tiny kitchen with a red-checked 
tablecloth on the table. We sat down and he offered me a beer. I figured I better take it. I 
really wanted the car, and I didn't want to, you know, offend him somehow. So we each had a 
beer and he got off, on this long, rambling . . . what would you call it? Rant, I guess. This rant 
about how all the shitters were against him. It was his word, Dennis. The shitters. He said it 
was the shitters that were making him sell his car.' 
'What did he mean. 
'I guess he meant that he was too old to drive, but he wouldn't put it that way. It was all 
their fault. The shitters. The shitters wanted him to take a driver's road-test every two years 
and an eye exam every year. It was the eye exam that bothered him. And he said they didn't 
like him on the street - no one did. So someone threw a stone at the car. 
'I understand all that. But I don't understand why . . .' Arnie paused in the doorway, 
oblivious of the fact that we were late for class. His hands were shoved into the back pockets 
of his jeans and he was frowning. 'I don't understand why he let Christine go to rack and ruin 
like that, Dennis. Like she was when I bought her. Mostly he talked about her like he really 
loved her - I know you thought it was just part of his sales-pitch but it wasn't - and then near</p>
      <p class="calibre3">the end, when he was counting the money, he sort of growled, ‚ÄúThat shitting car, I'll be 
fucked if I know why you want it, boy. It's the ace of spades.‚Äù And I said something like I 
thought I could fix it up really nice. And he said, ‚ÄúAll that and more. If the shitters will let 
you.‚Äù' 
We went inside. Mr Leheureux, the French teacher, was going someplace fast, his bald 
head gleaming under the fluorescent lights. 'You boys are late,' he said in a harried voice that 
reminded me of the white rabbit in Alice in Wonderland. We hurried up until he was out of 
sight and then we slowed down again. 
Arnie said, 'When Buddy Repperton got after me like that, I was really scared.' He lowered 
his voice, smiling but serious 'I almost pissed my pants, if you want to know the truth. 
Anyway, I guess I used L6Bay's word without even thinking about it. In Repperton's case it 
fits, wouldn't you say?' 
'Yes.' 
'I gotta go,' Arnie said. 'Calculus, then Auto Shop III. I think I've learned the whole course 
on Christine the last two months anyway.' 
He hurried off and I just stood there in the hall for a minute, watching him go. I had a 
study-hall with Miss Rat-Pack period six on Mondays, and I thought I could slip in the back 
unnoticed . . . I had done it before. Besides, seniors get away with murder, as I was rapidly 
learning. 
I stood there, trying to shake a feeling of fright that would never be so amorphous or un-
concrete again. Something was wrong, something was out of place, out of joint. There was a 
chill, and not all the bright October sunshine spilling through all the high school windows in 
the world would dispel it. Things were as they always had been, but they were getting ready 
to change - I felt it. 
I stood there trying to get myself in gear, trying to tell myself that the chill was no more 
than my fears about my own future, and that it was the change coming that I was uneasy 
about. Maybe that was part of it. But it wasn't all. That shitting car, I'll be fucked if I know 
why you want it, boy. It's the ace of spades. I saw Mr Leheureux coming back from the office, 
and I started moving.

I think that everybody has a backhoe in his or her head, and at moments of stress or trouble 
you can fire it up and simply push everything into a great big slit-trench in the floor of your 
conscious mind. Get rid of it. Bury it. Except that that slit-trench goes down into the 
subconscious, and sometimes, in dreams, the bodies stir and walk. I dreamed of Christine 
again that night, Arnie behind the wheel this time, the decomposing corpse of Roland D. 
LeBay lolling obscenely in the shotgun seat as the car roared out of the garage at me, pinning 
me with the savage circles of its headlights.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">I woke up with my pillow crammed against my mouth to stifle the screams.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">19   THE ACCIDENT 
 
Tach it up, tach it up,                                                                                                                         
Buddy, gonna shut you down. 
- The Beach Boys 
 
That was the last time I talked to Arnie - really talked to him - until Thanksgiving, because 
the following Saturday was the day I got hurt. That was the day we played the Ridge Rock 
Bears again, and this time we lost by the truly spectacular score of 46-3. I wasn't around at 
the end of the game, however. About seven minutes into the third quarter I got into the open, 
took a pass, and was setting myself to run when I was hit simultaneously by three Bears 
defensive linemen. There was an instant of terrible pain - a bright flare, as if I had been 
caught on ground zero of a nuclear blast. Then there was a lot of darkness. 
Things stayed dark for a fairly long time, although it didn't seem long to me. I was 
unconscious for about fifty hours, and when I woke up late on the afternoon of Monday the 
twenty-third of October, I was in Libertyville Community Hospital. My dad and mom were 
there. So was Ellie, looking pale and strained. There were dark brown circles under her eyes, 
and I was absurdly touched; she had found it in her heart to cry for me in spite of all the 
Twinkies and Yodels I had hooked out of the breadbox after she went to bed, in spite of the 
time, when she was twelve, that I had given her a little bag of Vigoro after she had spent 
about a week looking at herself sideways in the mirror with her tightest T-shirt on so she 
could see if her boobs were getting any bigger (she had burst into tears and my mother had 
been super-pissed at me for almost two weeks), in spite of all the teasing and the shitty little 
I'm-one-up-on-you sibling games. 
Arnie wasn't there when I woke up, but he joined my family shortly; he and Leigh had been 
down in the waiting room. That evening my aunt and uncle from Albany showed up, and the 
rest of that week was a steady parade of family and friends - the entire football team showed 
up, including Coach Puffer, who looked as if he had aged about twenty years. I guess he had 
found out there were worse things than a losing season. Coach was the one who broke the 
news to me that I was never going to play football again, and I don't know what he expected - 
for me to bust out crying or maybe have hysterics, from the drawn, tense look on his face. 
But I didn't have much of a reaction at all, inwardly or outwardly. I was just glad to be alive 
and to know I would walk again, eventually. 
If I had been hit just once, I probably could have bounced right up and gone back for more. 
But the human body was never meant to get creamed from three different angles at the same 
time. Both of my legs were broken, the left in two places. My right arm had whipped around 
behind me when I went down, and I had sustained a nasty greenstick fracture of the forearm. 
But all of that was really only the icing on the cake. I had also gotten a fractured skull and</p>
      <p class="calibre3">sustained what the doctor in charge of my case kept calling 'a lower spinal accident', which 
seemed to mean that I had come within about a centimetre of being paralysed from the waist 
down for the rest of my life. 
I got a lot of visitors, a lot of flowers, a lot of cards. All of it was, in some ways, very 
enjoyable - like being alive to help celebrate your own wake. 
But I also got a lot of pain and a lot of nights when I couldn't sleep; I got an arm suspended 
over my body by weights and pulleys, likewise a leg (they both seemed to itch all the time 
under the casts), and a temporary cast what is called a 'presser cast' - around my lower back. 
Also, of course, I got the prospect of a long hospital stay and endless trips in a wheelchair to 
that chamber of horrors so innocently labelled the Therapy Wing. 
Oh and one other thing - I got a lot of time. 
I read the paper; I asked questions of my visitors; and on more than a few occasions, as 
things went on and my suspicions began to get out of hand, I asked myself if I might not be 
losing my mind. 
I was in the hospital until Christmas, and by the time I got home, my suspicions had almost 
taken their final shape. I was finding it more and more difficult to deny that monstrous shape, 
and I knew damned well I wasn't losing my mind. In some ways it would have been better - 
more comforting - if I could have believed that. By then I was badly frightened, and more 
than half in love with my best friend's girl, as well. 
Time to think . . . too much time. 
Time to call myself a hundred names for what I was thinking about Leigh. Time to took up 
at the ceiling of my room and wish I had never heard of Arnie Cunningham . . . or Leigh 
Cabot . . . or of Christine.</p>
