About fifteen minutes before Leigh was due, I got my crutches under me and worked my 
way to the chair closest the door, so she'd be sure to hear me when I hollered for her to come 
in. Then I picked up my copy of Esquire again and turned back to an article reading 'The 
Next Vietnam,' which was part of a school assignment. I still had no success reading it. I was 
nervous and scared, and part of it - a lot of it, I guess - was simple eagerness. I wanted to see 
her again. 
The house was empty. Not too long after Leigh called that stormy Christmas Eve afternoon, 
I got my dad aside and asked him if he could maybe take Mom and Elaine someplace the 
afternoon of the twenty-sixth. 
'Why not?' he agreed amiably enough. 
'Thanks, Dad.' 
'Sure. But you owe me one, Dennis.' 
'Dad!' 
He winked solemnly. 'I'll scratch your back if you'll scratch mine.' 
'Nice guy,' I said. 
'A real prince,' he agreed. 
My dad, who is no slouch, asked me if it had to do with Arnie. 'She's his girl, isn't she?' 
'Well,' I said, not sure just what the situation was, and uncomfortable for reasons of my 
own, 'she has been. I don't know about now.' 
'Problems?' 
'I didn't do such a hot job being his eyes, did I?' 
'It's hard to see from a hospital bed, Dennis. I'll see you mother and Ellie are out Tuesday 
afternoon. Just be careful, okay?'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Since then, I've pondered exactly what he might have meant by that; he surely couldn't have 
been worried about me trying to jump Leigh's bones, with one upper leg still in plaster and a 
half-cast on my back. I think maybe he was just afraid that something had gotten terribly out 
of whack, with my old childhood friend suddenly a stranger, and a stranger who was out on 
bail at that. 
I sure thought something was out of whack, and it scared the piss out of me. The Keystone 
doesn't publish on Christmas, but all three Pittsburgh network-TV affiliates and both the 
independent channels had the story of what had happened to Will Darnell, along with bizarre 
and frightening pictures of his house. The side facing the road had been demolished. It was 
the only word which fit. That side of the house looked as if some mad Nazi had driven a 
Panzer tank through it. The story had been headlined this morning - FOUL PLAY 
SUSPECTED IN BIZARRE DEATH OF SUSPECTED CRIME FIGURE. That was bad enough, 
even without another picture of Will Darnell's house with that big hole punched in the side. 
But you had to check page three to get the rest of it. The other item was smaller because Will 
Darnell had been a 'suspected crime figure', and Don Vandenberg had only been a dipshit 
dropout gas-jockey. 
SERVICE STATION ATTENDANT KILLED IN CHRISTMAS EVE HIT-AND-RUN, this 
headline read. A single column followed. The story ended with the Libertyville Chief of 
Police theorizing that the driver had probably been drunk or stoned. Neither he nor the 
Keystone made any attempt to connect the deaths, which had been separated by almost ten 
miles on the night of a screaming blizzard which had stopped all traffic in Ohio and western 
Pennsylvania. But I could make connections. I didn't want to, but I couldn't help it. And 
hadn't my father been looking at me strangely several times during the morning? Yes. Once 
or twice it had seemed he would say something - I had no idea what I would say if he did; 
Will Darnell's death, bizarre as it had been, was nowhere nearly as bizarre as my suspicions. 
Then he had closed his mouth without speaking. That, to be up front about it, was something 
of a relief. 
The doorbell chimed at two past two. 
'Come on in!' I yelled, getting up on my crutches again anyway. 
The door opened and Leigh poked her head in. 'Dennis?' 
'Yeah. Come on in.' 
She did, looking very pretty in a bright red ski parka and dark blue pants. She pushed the 
parka's fur-edged hood back. 
'Sit down, she said, unzipping her parka. 'Go on, right now, that's an order. You look like a 
big dumb stork on those things.' 
'Keep it up,' I said, sitting down again with an ungainly plop. When you're cast in plaster, 
it's never like in the movies; you never sit down like Cary Grant getting ready to have 
cocktails at the Ritz with Ingrid Bergman. It all happens at once, and if the cushion you land</p>
      <p class="calibre3">on doesn't give out a big loud raspberry, as if your sudden descent had scared you into cutting 
the cheese, you count yourself ahead of the game. This time I got lucky. 'I'm such a sucker for 
flattery that I make myself sick.' 
'How are you, Dennis?' 
'Mending,' I said.' How about you?' 
'I've been better,' she said in a low voice, and bit at her lower lip. This can sometimes be a 
seductive gesture on a girl's part, but it wasn't this time. 
'Hang up your coat and sit down yourself.' 
'Okay.' Her eyes touched mine, and looking at them was a little much. I looked someplace 
else, thinking about Arnie. 
She hung her coat up and came back into the living room slowly. 'Your folks - ' 
'I got my father to take everyone out,' I said. 'I thought maybe' I shrugged - 'we ought to talk 
just between ourselves.' 
She stood by the sofa, looking at me across the room. I was struck again by the simplicity 
of her good looks her lovely girl's figure outlined in dark blue pants and a sweater of light, 
powdery blue, an outfit that made me think about skiing. Her hair was tied in a loose pigtail 
and lay over her left shoulder. Her eyes were the colour of her sweater, maybe a little darker. 
A cornfed American beauty, you would have said, except for the high cheekbones, which 
seemed a little arrogant, bespeaking some older, more exotic heritage - maybe some fifteen or 
twenty generations back there was a Viking in the woodpile. 
Or maybe that isn't what I was thinking at all. 
She saw me looking at her too long and blushed. I looked away. 
'Dennis, are you worried about him?' 
'Worried? Scared might be a better word. 
'What do you know about that car? What has he told you?' 
'Not much,' I said. 'Look, would you like something to drink? There's some stuff in the 
fridge I felt for my crutches. 
'Sit still,' she said. 'I would like something, but I'll get it. What about you?' 
'I'll take a ginger ale, if there's one left.' 
She went into the kitchen and I watched her shadow on the wall, moving lightly, like a 
dancer. There was a momentary added weight in my stomach, almost like a sickness. There's 
a name for that sort of sickness. I think it's called failing in love with your best friend's girl.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'You've got an automatic ice-maker.' Her voice floated back. 'We've got one too. I love it.' 
'Sometimes it goes crazy and sprays ice-cubes all over the floor,' I said. 'It's like Jimmy 
Cagney in White Heat. “Take that, you dirty rats.” It drives my mother crazy.' I was babbling. 
She laughed. Ice-cubes clinked in glasses. Shortly she came back with two glasses of ice 
and two cans of Canada Dry. 
'Thanks,' I said, taking mine. 
'No, thank you,' she said, and now her blue eyes were dark and sober. 'Thanks for being 
around. If I had to deal with this alone, I think I'd . . . I don't know.' 
'Come on,' I said. 'It's not that bad.' 
'Isn't it? Do you know about Darnell?' I nodded. 
'And that other one? Don Vandenberg.' 
So she had made the connection too. 
I nodded again. 'I saw it. Leigh, what is it about Christine that bothers you?' 
For a long time I didn't know if she was going to answer. If she would be able to answer. I 
could see her struggling with it, looking down at her glass, held in both hands. 
At last in a very low voice, she said, 'I think she tried to kill me.' 
I don't know what I had expected, but it wasn't that. 'What do you mean?' 
She talked, first hesitantly, then more rapidly, until it was pouring out of her. It is a story 
you have already heard, so I won't repeat it here; suffice to say that I tried to tell it pretty 
much as she told it to me. She hadn't been kidding about being scared. It was in the pallor of 
her face, the little hitches and gulps of her voice, the way her hands constantly caressed her 
upper arms, as if she was too cold in spite of the sweater. And the more she talked, the more 
scared I got. 
She finished by telling me how, as consciousness dwindled, the dashboard lights had 
seemed to turn into watching eyes. She laughed nervously at this last, as if trying to take the 
curse off an obvious absurdity, but I didn't laugh back. I was remembering George LeBay's 
dry voice as we sat in cheap patio chairs in front of the Rainbow Motel, his voice telling me 
the story of Roland, Veronica, and Rita. I was remembering those things and my mind was 
making unspeakable connections. Lights were going on. I didn't like what they were 
revealing. My heart started to thud heavily in my chest, and I couldn't have joined in her 
laughter if my life had depended on it. 
She told me about the ultimatum she had given him - her or the car. She told me about 
Arnie's furious reaction. That had been the last time she went out with him.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'Then he got arrested,' she said, 'and I started to think . . . think about what had happened to 
Buddy Repperton and those other boys . . . and Moochie Welch. . . . ' 
'And now Vandenberg and Darnell.' 
'Yes. But that's not all.' She drank from her glass of ginger ale and then poured in more. The 
edge of the can chattered briefly against the rim of the glass. 'Christmas Eve, when I called 
you, my mom and dad went out for drinks at my dad's boss's house. And I started to get 
nervous. I was thinking about . . . oh, I don't know what I was thinking about.' 
'I think you do.' 
She put a hand to her forehead and rubbed it, as if she was getting a headache. 'I suppose I 
do, I was thinking about that car being out. Her. Being out and getting them, But if she was 
out on Christmas Eve, I guess she had plenty to keep her busy without bothering my par - ' 
She slammed the glass down, making me jump. 'And why do I keep talking about that car as 
if it was a person?' she cried out, Tears had begun to spill down her checks. 'Why do I keep 
doing that?' 
On that night, I saw all too clearly what comforting her could lead to. Arnie was between us 
- and part of myself was, too. I had known him for a long time. A long good time. 
But that was then; this was now. 
I got my crutches under me, thumped my way across to the couch, and plopped down 
beside her. The cushions sighed. It wasn't a raspberry, but it was close. 
My mother keeps a box of Kleenex in the drawer of the little endtable. I pulled one out, 
looked at her, and pulled out a whole handful. I gave them to her and she thanked me. Then, 
not liking myself much, I put an arm around her and held her. 
She stiffened for a moment . . . and then let me draw her against my shoulder. She was 
trembling. We just sat that way, both of us afraid of even the slightest movement, I think. 
Afraid we might explode. Or something. Across the room, the clock ticked importantly on the 
mantelpiece. Bright winterlight fell through the bow windows that give a three-way view of 
the street. The storm had blown itself out by noon on Christmas Day, and now the hard and 
cloudless blue sky seemed to deny that there even was such a thing as snow - but the dunelike 
drifts rolling across lawns all up and down the street like the backs of great buried beasts 
confirmed it. 
'The smell,' I said at last. 'How sure are you about that?' 
'It was there!' she said, drawing away from me and sitting up straight. I collected my arm 
again, with a mixed sensation of disappointment and relief. 'It really was there . . . a rotten, 
horrible smell,' She looked at me. 'Why? Have you smelled it too?' 
I shook my head. I never had. Not really.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'What do you know about that car, the she asked. 'You know something. I can see it on your 
face.' 
It was my turn to think long and hard, and oddly what came into my mind was an image of 
nuclear fission from, some science textbook. A cartoon. You don't expect to see cartoons in 
science books, but as someone once said to me, there are many devious twists and turns along 
the path of public education . . . in point of fact, that someone had been Arnie himself. The 
cartoon showed two hotrod atoms speeding toward each other and then slamming together. 
Presto! Instead of a lot of wreckage (and atom ambulances to take away the dead and 
wounded neutrons), critical mass, chain reaction, and one hell of a big bang. 
Then I decided the memory of that cartoon really wasn't odd at all. Leigh had certain 
information I hadn't had before. The reverse was also true. In both cases a lot of it was 
guesswork, a lot of it was subjective feeling and circumstance . . . but enough of it was hard 
information to be really scary. I wondered briefly what the police would do if they knew what 
we did. I could guess: nothing. Could you bring a ghost to trial? Or a car? 
'Dennis?' 
'I'm thinking,' I said, 'Can't you smell the wood burning?' 
'What do you know?' she asked again 
Collision. Critical mass. Chain reaction. Kaboom. 
The thing was, I was thinking, if we put our information together, we would have to do 
something or tell someone. Take some action. We - 
I remembered my dream: the car sitting there in LeBay's garage, the motor revving up and 
then falling off, revving up again, the headlights coming on, the shriek of tyres. 
I took her hands in both of mine. 'Okay,' I said. 'Listen. Arnie: he bought Christine from a 
guy who is dead now. A guy named Roland D. LeBay. We saw her on his lawn one day when 
we were coming home from work, and 'You're doing it too,' she said softly. 
'What?' 
'Calling it she.' 
I nodded, not letting go of her hands. 'Yeah. I know. It's hard to stop. The thing is, Arnie 
wanted her - or it, or whatever that car is - from the first time he laid eyes on her. And I think 
now . . . I didn't then, but I do now . . . that LeBay wanted Arnie to have her just as badly, 
that he would have given her to him if it had come to that. It's like Arnie saw Christine and 
knew, and then LeBay saw Arnie and knew the same thing.' 
Leigh pulled her hands free of mine and began to rub her elbows restlessly again. 'Arnie 
said he paid - ' 
'He paid, all right. And he's still paying. That is, if Arnie's left at all.'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'I don't understand what you mean.' 
'I'll show you,' I said, 'in a few minutes. First, let me give you the background.' 
'All right.' 
'LeBay had a wife and daughter. This was back in the fifties. His daughter died beside the 
road. She choked to death. On a hamburger.' 
Leigh's face grew white, then whiter; for a moment she seemed as milky and translucent as 
clouded glass. 
'Leigh!' I said sharply. 'Are you all right?' 
'Yes,' she said with a chilling placidity. Her colour didn't improve. Her mouth moved in a 
horrid grimace that was perhaps intended to be a reassuring smile. 'I'm fine.' She stood up. 
'Where is the bathroom, please?' 
'There's one at the end of the hall,' I said. 'Leigh, you look awful.' 
'I'm going to vomit,' she said in that same placid voice, and walked away. She moved 
jerkily now, like a puppet, all the dancer's grace I had seen in her shadow now gone. She 
walked out of the room slowly, but when she was out of sight the rhythm of her stride picked 
up; I heard the bathroom door thrown open, and then the sounds. I leaned back against the 
sofa and put my hands over my eyes. 
* * * * * 
When she came back she was still pale but had regained a touch of her colour. She had 
washed her face and there were still a few drops of water on her cheeks. 
'I'm sorry,' I said. 
'It's all right. It just . . . startled me.' She smiled wanly. 'I guess that's an understatement.' 
She caught my eyes with hers. 'Just tell me one thing, Dennis. What you said. Is it true? 
Really true?' 
'Yeah,' I said. 'It's true. And there's more. But do you really want to hear any more?' 
'No,' she said. 'But tell me anyway.' 
'We could drop it,' I said, not really believing it. 
Her grave, distressed eyes held mine. 'It might be . . . safer . . . if we didn't,' she said. 
'His wife committed suicide shortly after their daughter died.' 
'The car . . . ' 
' . . . was involved.'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'How?' 
'Leigh - ' 
'How? 
So I told her - not just about the little girl and her mother, but about LeBay himself, as his 
brother George had told me, His bottomless reservoir of anger. The kids who had made fun of 
his clothes and his bowl haircut. His escape into the Army, where everyone's clothes and 
haircuts were the same. The motor pool. The constant railing at the shitters, particularly those 
shitters who brought him their big expensive cars to be fixed at government expense. The 
Second World War. The brother, Drew, killed in France. The old Chevrolet. The old Hudson 
Hornet. And through it all, a steady and unchanging backbeat, the anger. 
'That word,' Leigh murmured. 
'What word?' 
'Shitters.' She had to force herself to say it, her nose wrinkling in rueful and almost 
unconscious distaste. 'He uses it. Arnie.' 
'I know.' 
We looked at each o her, and her hands found mine again. 
'You're cold,' I said. Another bright remark from that fount of wisdom, Dennis Guilder. I 
got a million of em. 
'Yes. I feel like I'll never be warm again.' 
I wanted to put my arms around her and didn't. I was afraid to. Arnie was still too much 
mixed up in things. The most awful thing - and it was awful - was how it seemed more and 
more that he was dead . . . dead, or under some weird enchantment. 
'Did his brother say anything else?' 
'Nothing that seems to fit.' But a memory rose like a bubble in still water and popped: He 
was obsessed and he was angry, but he was not a monster, George LeBay had told me. At 
least . . . I don't think he was. It had seemed that, lost in the past as he had been, he had been 
about to say something more . . . and then had realized where he was and that he was talking 
to a stranger. What had he been about to say?' 
All at once I had a really monstrous idea. I pushed it away. It went . . . but it was hard work, 
pushing that idea. 
Like pushing a piano. And I could still see its outlines in the shadows. 
I became aware that Leigh was looking at me very closely, and I wondered how much of 
what I had been thinking showed on my face.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'Did you take Mr LeBay's address?' she said. 
'No.' I thought for a moment, and then remembered the funeral, which now seemed 
impossibly far back in time. 'But I imagine the Libertyville American Legion Post has it. 
They buried LeBay and contacted the brother. Why?' 
Leigh only shook her head and went to the window, where she stood looking out into the 
blinding day. Shank of the year, I thought randomly. 
She turned back to me, and I was struck by her beauty again, calm and undemanding except 
for those high, arrogant cheekbones - the sort of cheekbones you might expect to see on a 
lady probably carrying a knife in her belt. 
'You said you'd show me something,' she said. 'What was it?' 
I nodded. There was no way to stop now. The chain reaction had started. There was no way 
to shut it down. 
'Go upstairs,' I said, 'My room's the second door on the left. Look in the third drawer of my 
dresser. You'll have to dig under some of my undies, but they won't bite.' 
She smiled - only a little, but even a little was an improvement'. 'And what am I going to 
find? A Baggie of dope?' 
'I gave that up last year,' I said, smiling back. ''Ludes this year. I finance my habit selling 
heroin down at the junior high.' 
'What is it? Really?' 
'Arnie's autograph,' I said, 'immortalized on plaster.' 
'His autograph?' 
I nodded. 'In duplicate.' 
She found them, and five minutes later we were on the couch again, looking at the two 
squares of plaster cast. They sat side by side on the glass-topped coffee table, slightly ragged 
on the sides, a little the worse for wear. Other names danced off into limbo on one of them. I 
had saved the casts, had even directed the nurse on where to cut them, Later I bad cut out the 
two squares, one from the right leg, one from the left. 
We looked at them silently: 
Arnie Cunningham   on the right; 
Arnie Cunningham on the left. 
Leigh looked at me, questioning and puzzled. 'Those are pieces of your - '</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'My casts, yeah.' 
'Is it . . . a joke, or something?' 
'No joke. I watched him sign both of them.' Now that it was out, there was a queer kind of 
loosening, or relief. It was good to be able to share this. It had been on my mind for a long 
time, itching and digging away. 
'But they don't look anything alike.' 
'You're telling me,' I said. 'But Arnie isn't much like he used to be either. And it all goes 
back to that goddam car.' I poked savagely at the square of plaster on the left. 'That isn't his 
signature. I've known Arnie almost all my life. I've seen his homework papers, I've seen him 
send away for things, I've watched him endorse his paycheques, and that is not his signature. 
The one on the left, yes. This one, no. You want to do something for me tomorrow, Leigh?' 
'What?' 
I told her. She nodded slowly. 'For us.' 
'Huh?' 
'I'll do it for us. Because we have to do something, don't we?' 
'Yes,' I said. 'I guess so. You mind a personal question?' She shook her head, her 
remarkable blue eyes never leaving mine.' 
'How have you been sleeping lately?' 
'Not so well,' she said. 'Bad dreams. How about you?' 
'No. Not so good. 
And then, because I couldn't help myself anymore, I put my hands on her shoulders and 
kissed her. There was a momentary hesitation, and I thought she was going to draw away . . . 
then her chin came up and she kissed me back, firmly and fully. Maybe it was sort of lucky at 
that, me being mostly immobilized. 
When the kiss was over she looked into my eyes, questioning. 
'Against the dreams,' I said, thinking it would come out stupid and phony-smooth, the way 
it looks on paper, but instead it sounded shaky and almost painfully honest. 
'Against the dreams,' she repeated gravely, as if it were a talisman, and this time she 
inclined her head towards me and we kissed again with those two ragged squares of plaster 
staring up at us like blind white eyes with Arnie's name written across them. We kissed for 
the simply animal comfort that comes with animal contact - sure, that, and something more, 
starting to be something more - and then we held each other without talking, and I don't think 
we were kidding ourselves about what was happening - at least not entirely. It was comfort,</p>
      <p class="calibre3">but it was also good old sex - full, ripe, and randy with teenage hormones. And maybe it had 
a chance to be something fuller and kinder than just sex. 
But there was something else in those kisses - I knew it, she knew it, and probably you do 
too. That other thing was a shameful sort of betrayal. I could feel eighteen years of memories 
cry out - the ant farms, the chess games, the movies, the things he had taught me, the times I 
had kept him from getting killed. Except maybe in the end, I hadn't. Maybe I had seen the last 
of him - and a poor, rag-tag end at that - on Thanksgiving night, when he brought me the 
turkey sandwiches and beer. 
I don't think it occurred to either of us until then that we had done nothing unforgivable to 
Arnie - nothing that might anger Christine. 
But now, of course, we had.</p>

What happened in the next three weeks or so was that Leigh and I played detective, and we 
fell in love. 
She went down to the Municipal Offices the next day and paid fifty cents to have two 
papers xeroxed - those papers got to Harrisburg, but Harrisburg sends a copy back to the 
town. 
This time my family was home when Leigh arrived. Ellie peeked in on us whenever she got 
the chance. She was fascinated by Leigh. and I was quietly amused when, about a week into 
the new year, she started wearing her hair tied back as Leigh did. I was tempted to get on her 
case about it . . . and withstood the temptation. Maybe I was growing up a little bit (but not 
enough to keep from sneaking one of her Yodels when I saw one hidden behind the 
Tupperware bowls of leftovers in the refrigerator). 
Except for Ellie's occasional peeks, we had the living room mostly to ourselves that next 
afternoon, the 27th of December, after the social amenities had been observed. I introduced 
Leigh to my mother and father, my mom served coffee, and we talked. Elaine talked the most 
- chattering about her school and asking Leigh all sorts of questions about ours. At first I was 
annoyed, and then I was grateful. Both my parents are the soul of middle-class politeness (if 
my mom was being led to the electric chair and bumped into the chaplain, she would excuse 
herself), and I felt pretty clearly that they liked Leigh, but it was also obvious - to me, at least 
- that they were puzzled and a little uncomfortable, wondering where Arnie fitted into all this. 
Which was what Leigh and I were wondering ourselves, I guess. Finally they did what 
parents usually do when they're puzzled in such situations - they dismissed it as kid business 
and went about their own business. Dad excused himself first, saying that his workshop in the 
basement was in its usual post-Christmas shambles and he ought to start doing something 
about it. Mom said she wanted to do some writing.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Ellie looked at me solemnly and said, 'Dennis, did Jesus have a dog?' 
I cracked up and so did Ellie, Leigh sat watching us laugh, smiling politely the way 
outsiders do when it's a family joke. 
'Split, Ellie,' I said. 
'What'll you do if I won't?' she asked, but it was only routine brattiness; she was already 
getting up. 
'Make you wash my underwear,' I said. 
'The hell you will!' Ellie declared grandly, and left the room. 
'My little sister,' I said. 
Leigh was smiling. 'She's great.' 
'If you had to live with her full-time you might change your mind. Let's see what you've 
got.' 
Leigh put one of the Xerox copies on the glass coffee table where the pieces of my casts 
had been yesterday. 
It was the re-registration of a used car, 1958 Plymouth sedan (4-door), red and white. It was 
dated November 1, 1978, and signed Arnold Cunningham. His father had co-signed for him: 
SIGNATURE OF OWNER     Arnie Cunningham 
   SIGNATURE OF PARENT OR GUARDIAN       
 (IF OWNER IS UNDER 18)    Michael Cunningham 
'What does that look like to you?' I asked. 
'One of the signatures on one of the squares you showed me,' she said. 'Which one?' 
'It's the one he signed just after I got crunched in Ridge Rock,' I said. 'It's the way his 
signature always looked. Now let's see the other one.' 
She put it down beside the first. This was a registration slip for a new car, 1958 Plymouth 
sedan (4-door), red and white. It was dated November 1, 1957 - I felt a nasty jolt at that exact 
similarity, and one look at Leigh's face told me she had seen it too. 
'Look at the signature,' she said quietly. 
I did.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">SIGNATURE OF OWNER  Roland D. LeBay 
SIGNATURE OF PARENT OR GUARDIAN       
 (IF OWNER IS UNDER 18). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
 
This was the handwriting Arnie had used on Thanksgiving evening, you didn't have to be a 
genius or a handwriting expert to see that. The names were different, but the writing was 
exactly the same. 
Leigh reached for my hands, and I took hers. 
* * * * * 
What my father did in his basement workshop was make toys. I suppose that might sound a 
little weird to you, but it's his hobby, Or maybe something more than a hobby - I think there 
might have been a time in his life when he had to make a difficult choice between going to 
college and going out on his own to become a toymaker. If that's true, then I guess he chose 
the safe way. Sometimes I think I see it in his eyes, like an old ghost not quite laid to rest, but 
that is probably only my imagination, which used to be a lot less active than it is now. 
Ellie and I were the chief ben eficiaries, but Arnie had also found some of my father's toys 
under various Christmas trees and beside various birthday cakes, as had Ellie's closest 
childhood friend Aimee Carruthers (long since moved to Nevada and now referred to in the 
doleful tones reserved for those who have died young and senselessly) and many other 
chums. 
Now my dad gave most of what he made to the Salvation Army 400 Fund, and before 
Christmas the basement always reminded me of Santa's workshop - until just before 
Christmas it would be filled with neat white cardboard cartons containing wooden trains, 
little tool-chests., Erector-set clocks that really kept time, stuffed animals, a small puppet 
theatre or two. His main interest was in wooden toys (up until the Vietnam war he had made 
battalions of toy soldiers, but in the last five years or so they had been quietly phased out - 
even now I'm not sure he was aware he was doing it), but like a good spray hitter, my dad 
went to all fields. During the week after Christmas there was a hiatus. The workshop would 
seem terribly empty, with only the sweet smell of sawdust to remind us that the toys had ever 
been there. 
In that week he would sweep, clean, oil his machinery, and get ready for next year. Then, as 
the winter wore on through January and February, the toys and the seeming junk that would 
become parts of toys would begin appearing again - trains and joined wooden ballerinas with 
red spots of colour on their cheeks, a box of stuffing raked out of someone's old couch that 
would later end in a bear's belly (my father called every one of his bears Owen or Olive - I 
had worn out six Owen Bears between infancy and second grade, and Ellie had worn out a 
like number of Olive Bears), little snips of wire, buttons, and flat, disembodied eyes scattered</p>
      <p class="calibre3">across the worktable like something out of a pulp horror story. Last, the liquor-store boxes 
would appear, and the toys would again be packed into them. 
In the last three years he had gotten three awards from the Salvation Army, but he kept 
them hidden away in a drawer, as if he was ashamed of them. I didn't understand it then and 
don't now - not completely - but I know it wasn't shame. My father had nothing to be 
ashamed of. 
I worked my way down that evening after supper, clutching the bannister madly with one 
arm and using my other crutch like a ski-pole. 
'Dennis,' he said, pleased but slightly apprehensive. 'You need any help?' 
'No, I got it.' 
He put his broom aside by a small yellow drift of shavings and watched to see if I was 
really going to make it. 'How about a push, then?' 
'Ha-ha, very funny.' 
I got down, semi-hopped over to the big easy chair my father keeps in the corner beside our 
old Motorola black-and-white, and sat down. Plonk. 
'How you doing?' he asked. 
'Pretty good.' 
He brushed up a dustpanful of shavings, dumped them into his wastebarrel, sneezed, and 
brushed up some more. 'No pain?' 
'No. Well . . . some.' 
'You want to be careful of stairs. If your mother had seen what you just did -' 
I grinned. 'She'd scream, yeah.' 
'Where is your mother?' 
'She and Ellie went over to the Rennekes'. Dina Renneke got a complete library of Shaun 
Cassidy albums for Christmas. Ellie is green.' 
'I thought Shaun was out,' my father said. 
'I think she's afraid fashion might be doubling back on her.' 
Dad laughed. Then there was a companionable silence for a while, me sitting, him 
sweeping. I knew he'd get around to it, and presently he did. 
'Leigh,' he said, 'used to go with Arnie, didn't she? ' 
'Yes,' I said.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">He glanced at me, then down at his work again. I thought he would ask me if I thought that 
was wise, or maybe mention that one fellow stealing another fellow's girl was not the best 
way to promote friendship and accord. But he said neither of those things. 
'We don't see much of Arnie anymore. Do you suppose he's ashamed of the mess he's in?' 
I had the feeling that my father didn't believe that at all; that he was simply testing the 
wind. 
'I don't know,' I said. 
'I don't think he has much to worry about. With Darnell dead' - he tipped his dustpan into 
the barrel and the shavings slid in with a soft flump - 'I doubt if they'll even bother to 
prosecute.' 
'No?' 
'Not Arnie. Not on anything serious. He may be fined, and the judge will probably lecture 
him, but nobody wants to put an indelible black mark on the record of a nice young suburban 
white boy who is bound for college and a fruitful place in society.' 
He shot me a sharp questioning look, and I shifted in the chair, suddenly uncomfortable. 
'Yeah, I suppose.' 
'Except he's not really like that anymore, is he, Dennis?' 
'No. He's changed.' 
'When was the last time you actually saw him?' 
'Thanksgiving.' 
Was he okay then?' 
I shook my head slowly, suddenly feeling like crying and blurting it all out. I had felt that 
way once before and hadn't; I didn't this time, either, but for a different reason. I remembered 
what Leigh had said, about being nervous for her parents on Christmas Eve. And it seemed to 
me now that the fewer the people who knew about our suspicions, the safer . . . for them. 
'What's wrong with him?' 
'I don't know.' 
'Does Leigh?' 
'No. Not for sure. We have . . . some suspicions.' 
'Do you want to talk about them?' 
'Yes. In a way I do. But I think it would be better if I didn't.'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'All right,' he said. 'For now.' 
He swept the floor. The sound of the hard bristles on the concrete was almost hypnotic. 
'And maybe you had better talk to Arnie before too much longer.' 
'Yeah. I was thinking about that.' But it wasn't an interview I looked forward to. 
There was another period of silence. Dad finished sweeping and then glanced around. 
'Looks pretty good, huh?' 
'Great, Dad.' 
He smiled a little sadly and lit a Winston. Since his heart attack he had given the butts up 
almost completely, but kept a pack around, and every now and then he'd have one - usually 
when he felt under stress. 'Bullshit. It looks empty as hell.' 
'Well . . . yeah.' 
'You want a hand upstairs, Dennis?' 
I got my crutches under me. 'I wouldn't turn it down.' He looked at me and snickered. 'Long 
John Silver. All you need is the parrot.' 
'Are you going to stand there giggling or give me a hand?' 
'Give you a hand, I guess.' 
I slung an arm over his shoulder, feeling somehow like a little kid again - it brought back 
almost forgotten memories of him carrying me upstairs to bed on Sunday nights, after I 
started to doze off halfway through the Ed Sullivan Show. The smell of his aftershave was 
just the same. 
At the top he said, 'Step on me if I'm getting too personal, Denny, but Leigh's not going 
with Arnie anymore, is she.' 
'No, Dad.' 
'Is she going with you? ' 
'I . . . well, I don't really know. I guess not.' 
'Not yet, you mean.' 
'Well - yeah, I guess so.' I was starting to feel uncomfortable, and it must have showed, but 
he pushed on anyway. 
'Would it be fair to say that maybe she broke it off with Arnie because he wasn't the same 
person anymore?' 
'Yes. I think that would be fair to say.'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'Does he know about you and Leigh?' 
'Dad, there's nothing to know . . . at least, not yet. He cleared his throat, seemed to consider, 
and then said nothing. I let go of him and worked at getting my crutches under me. I worked 
a little harder at it than I had to, maybe. 
'I'll give you a little gratuitous advice,' my father said finally. 'Don't let him know what's 
between you and her - and never mind the protestations that there isn't anything. You're 
trying to help him some way, aren't you?' 
'I don't know if there's anything either Leigh or I can do for Arnie, Dad.' 
'I've seen him two or three times,' my father said. 
'You have?' I said, startled. 'Where?' 
My father shrugged. 'On the street. Downtown. You know. Libertyville's-not that big, 
Dennis. He . . . ' 
'He what?' 
'Hardly seemed to recognize me. And he looks older. Now that his face has cleared, he 
looks much older. I used to think he took after his father, but now - ' He broke off suddenly. 
'Dennis, has it occurred to you that Arnie may be having some sort of nervous breakdown.' 
'Yes,' I said, and only wished I could have told him that there were other possibilities. 
Worse ones. Possibilities that would have made my old man wonder if I was the one having a 
nervous breakdown. 
'You be careful,' he said, and although he didn't mention what had happened to Will 
Darnell, I suddenly felt strongly that he was thinking of it. 'You be careful, Dennis.' 
* * * * * 
Leigh called me on the telephone the next day and said her father was being called away to 
Los Angeles on year-end business and had proposed, on the spur of the moment, that they all 
go along with him and get away from the cold and the snow. 
'My mother was crazy about the idea, and I just couldn't think of any plausible reason to say 
no,' she said. 'It's only ten days, and school doesn't start again until January 8th.' 'It sounds 
great,' I said. 'Have fun out there.' 
'You think I should go?' 
'If you don't, you ought to have your head examined.' 
'Dennis?' 
'What?'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Her voice dropped a little. 'You'll be careful won't you? I . . . well, I've been thinking about 
you a lot lately.' 
She hung up then, leaving me feeling surprised and warm - but the guilt remained, fading a 
little now, maybe, but still there. My father had asked me if I was trying to help Arnie. Was 
I? Or was I maybe only snooping into a part of his life which he had expressly marked off-
limits . . . and stealing his girl in the process? And what exactly would Arnie do or say if he 
found out? 
My head ached with questions, and I thought that maybe it was just as well that Leigh was 
going away for a while. 
As she herself had said about our folks, it seemed safer. 
* * * * * 
On Friday the 29th, the last business day of the old year, I called the Libertyville American 
Legion Post and asked for the secretary. I got his name, Richard McCandless, from the 
building's janitor, who also found a telephone number to go with it. The number turned out to 
be that of David Emerson's, Libertyville's 'good' furniture store. I was told to wait a moment 
and then McCandless came on, a deep, gravelly voice that sounded a tough sixty - as if 
maybe Patton and the owner of this voice had fought their way across Germany to Berlin 
shoulder to shoulder, possibly biting enemy bullets out of the air with their teeth as they went. 
'McCandless,' he said. 
'Mr McCandless, my name is Dennis Guilder. Last August you put on a military-style 
funeral for a fellow named Roland LeBay - ' 
'Was he a friend of yours?' 
'No, only a bare acquaintance, but - ' 
'Then I don't have to spare your feelings none, McCandless said, gravel rattling in his 
throat. He sounded like Andy Devine crossed with Broderick Crawford. 'LeBay was nothing 
but a pure-d sandy-craw sonofabitch, and if I'd had my way, the Legion wouldn't have had a 
thing to do with planting him. He quit the organization back in 1970. If he hadn't quit, we 
would have fired him. That man was the most contentious bastard that every lived.' 
'Was he?' 
'You bet he was. He'd pick an argument with you, then up it to a fight if he could. You 
couldn't play poker with the sonofabitcb, and you sure couldn't drink with him. You couldn't 
keep up with him, for one thing, and he'd get mean for another. Not that he had to go far to 
get to mean. What a crazy bastard he was, you should pardon my fran-sayse. Who are you, 
boy?'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">For an insane moment I thought of quoting Emily Dickinson at him: I'm nobody! Who are 
you? 
'A friend of mine bought a car from LeBay just before he died - ' 
'Shit! Not that '57?' 
'Well, actually it was a '58 - ' 
Yeah, yeah, '57 or '58, red and white. That was the only goddam thing he cared about, 
Treated it like it was a woman. It was over that car he quit the Legion, did you know that?' 
'No,' I said. 'What happened?' 
'Ah, shit. Ancient history, kid. I'm bending your car as it is. But every time I think of that 
sonofabitch LeBay, I see red. I've still got the scars on my hands. Uncle Sam had three years 
or my life during World War II and I never got so much as a Purple Heart out of it, although I 
was in combat almost all that time. I fought my way across half the little shitpot islands in the 
South Pacific. Me and about fifty other guys stood up to a banzai charge on Guadalcanal two 
fucking million Japs coming at us hopped to the eyeballs and waving those swords they made 
out of Maxwell House coffee cans - and I never got a scar, I felt a couple of bullets go right 
by me, and just before we broke that charge the guy next to me got his guts rearranged 
courtesy of the Emperor of Japan, but the only times I saw the colour of my own blood over 
there in the Pacific was when I cut myself shaving. Then . . . ' 
McCandless laughed. 
'Shit on toast, there I go again. My wife says I'll open my mouth too wide someday and just 
fall right in. What'd you say your name was?' 
'Dennis Guilder.' 
'Okay, Dennis, I bent your ear, now you bend mine. What did you want?' 
'Well, my friend bought that car and fixed it up . . . for a sort of a street-rod, I guess you'd 
say. A showpiece.' 
'Yeah, just like LeBay,' McCandless said, and my mouth went dry. 'He loved that fucking 
car, I'll say that for him. He didn't give a shit for his wife - you know what happened to her?' 
'Yes,' I said. 
'He drove her to it,' McCandless said grimly. 'After their kid died, she didn't get any 
comfort from him at all. None. I don't think he gave much of a shit about the kid, either. 
Sorry, Dennis. I never could shut up. Talk all the time. Always have. My mother used to say, 
“Dickie, your tongue's hung in the middle and runs on both ends.” What did you say you 
wanted?'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'My friend and I went to LeBay's funeral,' I said, 'and after it was over, I introduced myself 
to his brother - ' 
'He seemed a right enough type,' McCandless broke in. 'Schoolteacher. Ohio.' 
'That's right. I had a talk with him, and he did seem like a nice enough guy, I told him I was 
going to do my senior English paper on Ezra Pound - ' 
'Ezra who?' 
'Pound.' 
'Who the fuck's that? Was he at LeBay's funeral? ' 
'No, sir. Pound was a poet.' 
'A what?' 
'Poet. He's dead too.' 
'Oh.' McCandless sounded doubtful. 
'Anyway, LeBay - this is George LeBay he said he'd send me a bunch of magazines about 
Ezra Pound for my report, if I wanted them. Well, it turns out that I could use them, but I 
forgot to get his address. I thought you might have it.' 
'Sure, it'll be in the records; all that stuff is. I hate being fucking secretary, but my year's up 
this July, and never again. Know what I mean? Never-fucking-again.' 
'I hope I'm not being a real pain in the ass.' 
'No. Hell, no. I mean, that's what the American Legion's for, right? Gimme your address, 
Dennis, and I'll send you a card with the info on it.' 
I gave him my name and address and apologized again for bothering him at his job. 
'Think nothing of it,' he said. 'I'm on my fucking coffee break, anyhow.' I had a moment to 
wonder just what it was he did at David Emerson's, which really was where Libertyville's 
elite bought. Was he a salesman? I could see him showing some smart young lady around, 
saying, Here's one fuck of a nice couch, ma'am, and look at this goddam settee, we sure didn't 
have nothing like that on Guadalcanal when those fucking stoned-out Japs came at us with 
their Maxwell House swords. 
I grinned a little, but what he said next sobered me quickly. 
'I rode in that car of LeBay's a couple of times. I never liked it. I'll be damned if I know 
why, but I never did. And I never would ride in it after his wife . . .you know. Jesus, that gave 
me the spooks.'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'I'll bet,' I said, and my voice seemed to come from far away. 'Listen, what did happen when 
he quit the Legion? You said it had something to do with the car?' 
He laughed, sounding a little pleased. 'You're not really interested in all that ancient history, 
are you?' 
'Well, yeah, I am. My friend bought the car, remember.' 
'Well then I'll tell you. It was a pretty funny goddam thing, at that. A few of the guys 
mention it from time to time, when we've all had a few. I ain't the only one with scars on my 
hands. Get right down to the bottom of it, it was sort of spooky.' 
'What was?' 
'Aw, it was a kid's trick. -But nobody really liked the sonofabitch, you know. He was an 
outsider, a loner - ' 
Like Arnie, I thought. 
' - and we'd all been drinking,' McCandless finished. 'It was after the meeting, and LeBay 
had been making an even worse prick of himself than usual. So a bunch of us are at the bar, 
you know, and we could tell LeBay was getting ready to go home. He was getting his jacket 
on and arguing with Poochie Anderson about some baseball question. When LeBay went, he 
always went the same way, kid. He'd jump into that Plymouth of his, back up, and then floor 
it. That thing'd go out of the parking lot like a rocket, spraying gravel everywhere. So - this 
was Sonny Bellerman's idea - about four of us go out the back door to the parking lot while 
LeBay's shouting at Poochie. We all get behind the far corner of the building, because we 
know that's where he'll finish backing the car up before he takes off. He always called it by a 
girl's name, I told you it was like he was married to the fucking thing. 
“'Keep your eyes open and your heads down or he'll see us,” Sonny says. “And don't move 
until I give you a go.” We were all sort of tanked up, you know. 
'So about ten minutes later out he comes, drunk as a skunk and feeling around in his chinos 
for his keys. Sonny says, “Get ready, you guys, and keep low!” 
'LeBay gets in his car and backs her up. It was perfect, because he stopped to light a 
cigarette. While he did that, we grabbed the back bumper of that Fury and we lifted the rear 
wheels right off the ground so that when he tries to pull out, spraying gravel all over the side 
of the building like usual, you know, he's only gonna spin his wheels and not go anywhere. 
You see what I mean?' 
'Yeah,' I said. It was a kid's trick; we had pulled the same thing from time to time at school 
dances, and once, for a joke, we had blocked up Coach Puffer's Dodge so that the driving 
wheels were off the ground. 
'We got some kind of shock, though. He gets his cigarette lit, and then he turns on the radio. 
That's another thing that used to drive us all fucking bugshit, the way he always listened to</p>
      <p class="calibre3">that rock and roll music like he was some kid instead of old enough to qualify for Social-
fuckingSecurity. Then he put the tranny into drive. We didn't see it, because we were all 
hunkered down so he wouldn't see us. I remember Sonny Bellerman was kind of laughing, 
and just before it happened, he whispers, “They up, men?” and I whispers back, “Your 
pecker's up, Bellerman.” He was the only one who really got hurt, you know. Because of his 
wedding ring. But I swear to God, those wheels were up. We had that Plymouth's rear end 
four inches off the ground.' 
'What happened?' I asked. From the way the story was going, I thought I could guess. 
'What happened? He pulled out just like always, that's what happened! Just like all four 
wheels was on the ground, He spun gravel and ripped that rear bumper out of our hands and 
pulled about a yard of skin off with it. Took most of Sonny Bellerman's third finger; his 
wedding ring got caught under the bumper, you know, and that finger popped off like a cork 
coming out of a bottle. And we heard LeBay laughing as he went out, like he knew all along 
we was there. He could of, you know; if he'd gone back to use the bathroom after he finished 
shouting at Poochie, he could have looked right out the window while he whizzed and seen 
us standing around behind the building waiting for him. 
'Well, that was it for him and the Legion. We sent him a letter telling him we wanted him 
out, and he quit. And, just to show you how funny the world is, it was Sonny Bellerman who 
stood up at the meeting right after LeBay died and said we ought to do the right thing by him 
just the same. “Sure,” Sonny says, he says, “the guy was a dirty sonofabitch, but he fought the 
war with the rest of us. So why don't we send him off right?” So we did. I dunno. I guess 
Sonny Bellerman's a lot more of a Christian than I'll ever be.' 
'You must not have had the back wheels off the ground,' I said, thinking of what had 
happened to the guys who had screwed around with Christine in November. They had lost a 
lot more than some skin off their fingers. 
'We did, though,' McCandless said. 'When we got sprayed with gravel, it was from the front 
wheels. I've never to this day been able to figure out how he pulled that trick off. It's kind of 
spooky, like I said. Gerry Barlow - he was one of us who did it - always claimed LeBay 
threw a four-wheel drive into her somehow, but I don't think there's a conversion kit for 
something like that, do you?' 
'No,' I said. 'I don't think it could be done.' 
'Naw, never do it,' McCandless agreed. 'Never do it. Well, hey! I done jawed away most of 
my coffee break, kid. Want to get back and grab another half a cup before it all gets away 
from me. I'll send you that address if we got it. I think we do.' 
'Thank you, Mr McCandless.' 
'My pleasure, Dennis. Take care of yourself. 
'Sure. Use it, don't abuse it, right?'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">He laughed. 'That's what we used to say in the Fighting Fifth, anyway.' He hung up. 
I put the phone down slowly and thought about cars that still kept moving even when you 
lifted their driving wheels off the ground. Sort of spooky. It was spooky, all right, and 
McCandless still had the scars to prove it. That made me remember something George LeBay 
had told me. He had a scar to show from his association with Roland D. LeBay, as well. And 
as he grew older, his scar had spread.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">45   NEW YEAR'S EVE 
 
For this daring young star met his death                                                                                           
while in his car,                                                                                                                             
No one knows the reason why -                                                                                                          
Screaming tyres, flashing fire, and gone                                                                                    
was this young star,                                                                                                                       
O how could they let him die?                                                                                                   
Still, a young man is gone, but his legend                                                                                      
lingers on,                                                                                                                                               
For he died without a cause . . . 
                                — Bobby Troupe 
 
I called Arnie on New Year's Eve. I'd had a couple of days to think about it, and I didn't 
really want to do it, but I had to see him. I had come to believe I wouldn't be able to decide 
anything until I actually saw him again for myself, And until I had seen Christine again. I had 
mentioned the car to my father at breakfast, casually, as if in passing, and he told me that he 
believed all the cars that had been impounded in Darnell's Garage had now been 
photographed and returned. 
Regina Cunningham answered the phone, her voice stiff and formal. 'Cunningham 
residence.' 
'Hi, Regina, it's Dennis.' 
'Dennis!' She sounded both pleased and surprised. For a moment it was the voice of the old 
Regina, the one who gave Arnie and me peanut butter sandwiches with bits of bacon 
crumbled into them (peanut butter and bacon on stone-ground rye, of course). 'How are you? 
We heard that they sprung you from the hospital.' 
'I'm doing okay,' I said. 'How about you?' 
There was a brief silence, and then she said, 'Well, you know how things have been around 
here.' 
'Problems,' I said. 'Yeah.' 
'All the problems we missed 'in earlier years,' Regina said. 'I guess they just piled up in a 
corner and waited for us.' 
I cleared my throat a little and said nothing. 
'Did you want to talk to Arnie?'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'If he's there.' 
After another slight pause, Regina said, 'I remember that in the old days you and he used to 
swap back and forth on New Year's Eve, seeing the New Year in. Was that what you were 
calling about, Dennis?' She sounded almost timid, and that was not like the old full-steam-
ahead Regina at all. 
'Well, yeah,' I said. 'Kid stuff, I know, but - ' 
'No!' she said, sharply and quickly. 'No, not at all! If Arnie ever needed you, Dennis - 
needed some friend now is the time. He . . . he's upstairs now, sleeping. He sleeps much too 
much. And he's . . . he's not . . . he hasn't . 
'Hasn't what, Regina?' 
'He hasn't made any of his college applications! she burst out, and then immediately 
lowered her voice, as if Arnie might overhear. 'Not a single one! Mr Vickers, the guidance 
counsellor at school, called and told me! He scored 700s on his college boards, he could get 
into almost any college in the country - at least he could have before this - this trouble . . .' 
Her voice wavered toward tears, and then she got hold of herself again. 'Talk to him, Dennis. 
If you could spend the evening with him tonight . . . drink a few beers with him and just . . . 
just talk to him. . . ' 
She stopped, but I could tell there was something more. Something she needed to say and 
couldn't. 
'Regina,' I said. I hadn't liked the old Regina, the compulsive dominator who seemed to run 
the lives of her husband and son to fit her own timetable, but I liked this distracted, weepy 
woman even less. 'Come on. Take it easy, okay?' 
I'm afraid to talk to him,' she said finally. 'And Michael's afraid to talk to him. He . . . he 
seems to explode if you cross him on some subjects. At first it was only his car; now it's 
college too. Talk to him, Dennis, please.' There was another short pause, and then, almost 
casually, she brought out the heart of her dread: 'I think we're losing him.' 
'No, Regina, hey - ' 
'I'll get him,' she said abruptly, and the phone clunked down. The wait seemed to stretch 
out. I crooked the phone between my jaw and my shoulder and rapped my knuckles on the 
cast that still covered my upper left leg. I wrestled with a craven urge just to hang the 
telephone up and push this entire business away. 
Then the phone was picked up again. 'Hello?' a wary voice asked, and the thought that 
burned across my mind with complete assurance was: That's not Arnie. 
'Arnie?'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'It sounds like Dennis Guilder, the mouth that walks like a man,' the voice said, and that 
sounded like Arnie, all right - but at the same time, it didn't. His voice hadn't really deepened, 
but it seemed to have roughened, as if through overuse and shouting. It was eerie, as if I were 
talking to a stranger who was doing a pretty good imitation of my friend Arnie. 
'Watch what you're saying, dork,' I said. I was smiling but my hands were dead cold. 
'You know,' he said in a confidential voice, 'your face and my ass bear a suspicious 
resemblance.' 
'I've noticed the resemblance, but last time I thought it was the other way around,' I said, 
and then a little silence fell between us - we had gone through what passed for the amenities 
with us. 'So what are you doing tonight?' I asked. 
'Not much,' he said. 'No date or anything. You?' 
'Sure, I'm in great shape,' I said. 'I'm going to go pick up Roseanne and take her to Studio 
2000. You can come along and hold my crutches while we dance, if you want.' 
He laughed a little. 
'I thought I'd come over,' I said. 'Maybe you and me could see the New Year in like we used 
to. You know?' 
'Yeah!' Arnie said. He sounded pleased by the idea - but still not quite like himself. 'Watch 
Guy Lombardo and all that happy crappy. That'd be all right.' 
I paused for a moment, not quite sure what to say. Finally I replied cautiously, 'Well, maybe 
Dick Clark or someone. Guy Lombardo's dead, Arnie.' 
'Is he?' Arnie sounded puzzled, doubtful. 'Oh. Oh, yeah, I guess he is. But Dick Clark's 
hanging in there, right?' 
'Right,' I said. 
'I got to give it an eighty-five Dick, it's got a good beat and you can dance to it,' Arnie said, 
but it wasn't Arnie's voice at al I. My mind made a sudden and hideously unexpected cross-
connection 
(best smell in the world . . . except maybe for pussy) 
and my hand tightened down convulsively on the telephone. I think I almost screamed. I 
wasn't talking to Arnie; I was talking to Roland LeBay. I was talking to a dead man. 
'That's Dick, all right,' I heard myself say, as if from a distance. 
'How you getting over, Dennis? Can you drive?' 
'No, not yet. I thought I'd get my dad to drive me over. I paused momentarily, then plunged. 
'I thought maybe you could drive me back, if you got your car. Would that be okay?'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'Sure!' He sounded honestly excited. 'Yeah, that'd be good, Dennis! Real good! We'll have 
some laughs. Just like the old times.' 
'Yes,' I said. And then - I swear to God it just popped out - I added, 'Just like in the motor 
pool.' 
'Yeah, that's right!' Arnie replied, laughing. 'Too much! See you, Dennis.' 
'Right.' I said automatically. 'See you.' I hung up, and I looked at the telephone, and 
presently I began to shudder all over. I had never been so frightened in my life as I was right 
then. Time passes: the mind rebuilds its defences. I think one of the reasons there is so little 
convincing evidence of psychic phenomena is that the mind goes to work and restructures the 
evidence. A little stacking is better than a lot of insanity. Later I questioned what I heard, or 
led myself to believe that Arnie had misunderstood my comment, but in the few moments 
after I put telephone down, I was sure: LeBay had gotten in him. Somehow, dead or not, 
LeBay was in him. 
And LeBay was taking over. 
* * * * * 
New Year's Eve was cold and crystal clear. My dad dropped me off at the Cunninghams' at 
quarter past seven and helped me over to the back door - crutches were not made for winter 
or snow-packed paths. 
The Cunninghams' station wagon was gone, but Christine stood in the driveway, her bright 
red-and-white finish sheened with a condensation of ice-crystals. She had been released with 
the rest of the impounded cars only this week. Just looking at her brought on a feeling of dull 
dread like a headache. I did not want to ride home in that car, not tonight, not ever. I wanted 
my own ordinary, mass-produced Duster with its vinyl seatcovers and its dumb bumper-
sticker reading MAFIA STAFF CAR. 
The back porch light flicked on, and we saw Arnie cross toward the door in silhouette. He 
didn't even look like Arnie. His shoulders loped; his movements seemed older. I told myself 
it was only imagination, my suspicions working on me, and of course I was full of bullshit . . 
. and I knew it. 
He opened the door and leaned out in an old flannel shirt and a pair of jeans. 'Dennis!' he 
said. 'My man!' 
'Hi, Arnie,' I said. 
'Hello, Mr Guilder.' 
'Hi, Arnie,' my dad said, raising one gloved hand. 'How's it been going?' 
'Well, you know, not that great. But that's all going to change, New year, new broom, out 
with the old shit, in with the new shit, right?'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'I guess so,' my father said, sounding a little taken aback. 'Dennis, are you sure you don't 
want me to come back and get you?' 
I wanted that more than anything, but Arnie was looking at me and his mouth was still 
smiling but his eyes were flat and watchful. 'No, Arnie'll bring me home . . . if that rustbucket 
will start, that is?' 
'Oh-oh, watch what you call my car,' Arnie said. 'She's very sensitive.' 
'Is she?' I asked. 
'She is,' Arnie said, smiling. 
I turned my head and called, 'Sorry, Christine.' 
'That's better.' 
For a moment all three of us stood there, my father and I at the bottom of the kitchen steps. 
Arnie in the doorway above us, none of us apparently knowing what to say next. I felt a kind 
of panic - someone had to say something, or else the whole, ridiculous fiction that nothing 
had changed would collapse of its own weight. 
'Well, okay,' my dad said at last. 'You two kids stay sober. If you have more than a couple 
of beers, Arnie, call me.' 
'Don't worry, Mr Guilder.' 
'We'll be all right,' I said, grinning a grin that felt plastic and false. 'You go on home and get 
your beauty sleep, Dad. You need it.' 
'Oh-ho,' my father said. 'Watch what you call my face. It's very sensitive.' 
He went back to the car. I stood and watched him, my crutches propped into my armpits. I 
watched him while he crossed behind Christine. And when he backed out of the driveway and 
turned toward home, I felt a little bit better. 
* * * * * 
I banged the snow off the tip of each crutch carefully while standing in the doorway. The 
Cunninghams' kitchen was tile-floored. A couple of near accidents had taught me that on 
smooth surfaces a pair of crutches with wet snow on them can turn into ice-skates. 
'You really operate on those babies,' Arnie said, watching me cross the floor. He took a 
pack of Tiparillos from the pocket of his flannel shirt, shook one out, bit down on the white 
plastic mouthpiece, and lit it with his head cocked to one side. The match flame played 
momentarily across his cheeks like yellow streaks of paint. 
'It's a skill I'll be glad to lose,' I said. 'When did you start with the cigars?' 
'Darnell's,' he said. 'I don't smoke em in front of my mother. The smell drives her bugshit.'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">He didn't smoke like a kid who just learning the habit - he smoked like a man who has been 
doing it for twenty years. 
'I thought I'd make popcorn,' he said. 'You up for that?' 
'Sure. You got any beer?' 
'That's affirmative. There's a six-pack in the fridge and two more downstairs.' 
'Great.' I sat down carefully at the kitchen table, stretching out my left leg. 'Where're your 
folks?' 
'Went to a New Year's Eve party at the Fassenbachs'. When's that cast come off?' 
'Maybe at the end of January, if I'm lucky.' I waved my crutches in the air and cried 
dramatically, 'Tiny Tim walks again! God bless us, every one!' 
Arnie, on his way to the stove with a deep pan, a bag of popcorn, and a bottle of Wesson 
Oil, laughed and shook his head. 'Same old Dennis. They didn't knock much of the stuffing 
out of you, you shitter.' 
'You didn't exactly overwhelm me with visits in the hospital, Arnie.' 
'I brought you Thanksgiving supper - what the hell do you want, blood?' 
I shrugged. 
Arnie sighed. 'Sometimes I think you were my good-luck charm, Dennis.' 
'Off my case, hose-head.' 
'No, seriously. I've been in hot water ever since you broke your wishbones, and I'm still in 
hot water. It's a wonder I don't look like a lobster.' He laughed heartily. It was not the sound 
you'd expect of a kid in trouble; it was the laugh of a man - yes, a man - who was enjoying 
himself tremendously, He put the pan on the stove and poured Wesson Oil over the bottom of 
it. His hair, shorter than it used to be and combed back in a style that was new to me, fell over 
his forehead. He flipped it back with a quick jerk of his head and added popcorn to the oil. He 
slammed a lid over the pan. Went to the fridge. Got a six-pack. Slammed it down in front of 
me, pulled off two cans, and opened them. Gave me one. Held up his. I held up mine. 
'A toast,' Arnie said. 'Death to all the shitters of the world in 1979.' 
I lowered my can slowly. 'I can't drink to that, man.' 
I saw a spark of anger in those grey eyes. It seemed to twinkle there, like spurious good 
humour, and then go out. 'Well, what can you drink to - man?' 
'How about to college?' I asked quietly.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">He looked at me sullenly, his earlier good humour gone like magic. 'I should have known 
she'd fill you full of that garbage. My mother is one woman who never stuck at getting low to 
get what she wants. You know that, Dennis. She'd kiss the devil's ass if that's what it took.' 
I put my beer-can down, still full. 'Well, she didn't kiss my ass. She just said you weren't 
making any applications and she was worried.' 
'It's my life,' Arnie said. His lips twisted, changing his face, making it extraordinarily ugly. 
'I'll do what I want.' 
'And college isn't it?' 
'Yeah, I'll go. But in my own time. You tell her that, if she asks. In my own time. Not this 
year. Definitely not. If she thinks I'm going to go off to Pitt or Horlicks or Rutgers and put on 
a freshman beanie and go boola-boola at the home football games, she's out of her mind. Not 
after the shitstorm I've been through this year. No way, man.' 
'What are you going to do?' 
'I'm taking off,' he said.'I'm going to get in Christine and we're going to motorvate right the 
Christ out of this one-timetable town. You understand?' His voice began to rise, to become 
shrill, and I felt horror sweep over me again. I was helpless against that unmanning fear and 
could only hope that it didn't show on my face. Because it wasn't just LeBay's voice now; 
now it was even LeBay's face, swimming under Arnie's like some dead thing preserved in 
Formalin. 'It's been nothing but a shitstorm, and I think that goddam Junkins is still after me 
full steam ahead, and he better watch out or somebody just might junk him - ' 
'Who's Junkins?' I asked. 
'Never mind,' he said. 'It's not important.' Behind him, the Wesson Oil had begun to sizzle. 
A kernel of corn popped - ponk! - against the underside of the lid. 'I've got to go shake that, 
Dennis. Do you want to make a toast or not? Makes no difference to me.' 
'All right,' I said. 'How about to us?' 
He smiled, and the constriction in my chest eased a little. 'Us, yeah, that's a good one, 
Dennis. To us. Gotta be that, huh?' 
'Gotta be,' I said, and my voice hoarsened a little. 'Yeah, gotta be.' 
We clicked the Bud cans together and drank. 
Arnie went over to the stove and began shaking the pan, where the corn was picking up 
speed. I let a couple of swallows of beer slide down my throat. Beer was still a fairly new 
thing to me then, and I had never been drunk on it because I liked the taste quite well, and 
friends - Lenny Barongg was the chief of them - had told me that if you got falling-down, 
standing-up, ralphing-down-your-shirt shitfaced, you couldn't even look at the stuff for 
weeks. Sadly, I have found out since that that isn't completely true.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">But Arnie was drinking like they were going to reinstitute Prohibition on January lst; he had 
finished his first can before the popcorn had finished popping. He crimped the empty, winked 
at me, and said, 'Watch me put it up the little tramp's ass, Dennis.' The allusion escaped me, 
so I just smiled noncommitally as he tossed the can toward the wastebasket. It banged the 
wall over it and dropped in. 
'Two points,' I said. 
'That's right,' he said. 'Hand me another one, would you?' 
I did, figuring what the hell - my folks were planning to see the New Year in at home, and 
if Arnie got really drunk and passed out, I could give my dad a call. Arnie might say things 
drunk that he wouldn't say sober, and I didn't want to ride home in Christine anyway. 
But the beer didn't seem to affect him. He finished popping the corn, dumped it into a big 
plastic bowl, melted half a stick of margarine, poured it over the top, salted it, and said, 'Let's 
go in the living room and watch some tube. What do you say?' 
'Fine by me.' I got my crutches, seated them in my armpits - which just lately felt as if they 
might be growing callouses and then groped for the three beers still on the table. 
'I'll come back for them,' Arnie said. 'Come on. Before you break everything all over again. 
He smiled at me, and for that moment he was nobody but Arnie Cunningham, so much so 
that it broke my heart a little bit to look at him. 
There was some dorky New Year's Eve special on. Donny and Marie Osmond were 
singing. both of them showing their giant white teeth in friendly but somehow sha,rklike 
grins. We let the TV play and talked. I told Arnie about the physical therapy sessions, and 
how I was working out with weights, and after two beers I confessed that I was sometimes 
afraid that I would never walk right again. Not playing football in college didn't bother me, 
but that did. He nodded calmly and sympathetically through it all. 
I may as well stop right here and tell you that I have never spent such a peculiar evening in 
my life. Worse things were waiting, but nothing that was so strange, so . . . so disjointed. It 
was like sitting through a movie where the picture is almost - but not quite - focused. 
Sometimes he seemed like Arnie, but at others he didn't seem like Arnie at all. He had picked 
up mannerisms I had never noticed before - twirling his car-keys nervously on the rectangle 
of leather to which they were attached, cracking his knuckles, occasionally biting at the ball 
of his thumb with his upper front teeth. There was that comment about putting it up the little 
tramp's ass when he tossed his beer-can. And although he had gotten through five beers by 
the time I had finished my second, just downing them one after the other, he still didn't seem 
drunk. 
And there were mannerisms I had always associatcd with Arnie which seemed to have 
disappeared completely: the quick, nervous pull at his earlobe when he was talking, the 
sudden stretch of his long legs ending with the ankles briefly crossed, his habit of expressing 
amusement by hissing air through his pursed lips instead of laughing outright. He did do that</p>
      <p class="calibre3">last once or twice. But more often he would signal his amusement in a string of shrill 
chuckles that I associated with LeBay. 
The special finished up at eleven, and Arnie switched around the dial until he found a 
dance-party in some New York hotel where they kept switching outside to Times Square, 
where a big crowd had already gathered. It wasn't Guy Lombardo, but it was close. 
'You're really not going to college?' I asked. 
'Not this year. Christine and I are going to head out for California right after graduation. 
That golden shore.' 
'Your folks know?' 
He looked startled at the idea. 'Hell, no! And don't you tell them, either! I need that like I 
need a rubber dick!' 
'What are you going to do out there?' 
He shrugged. 'Look for a job fixing cars. I'm as good at that as I am at anything.' And then 
he stunned me by saying casually, 'I'm hoping I can persuade Leigh to come with me. 
I swallowed beer the wrong way and began to cough, spraying my pants. Arnie slammed 
me on the back twice, hard. 'You okay?' 
'Sure,' I managed. 'Just went down the wrong pipe. Arnie . . . if you think she's going to 
come with you, you're living in a dream world. She's working on her college applications. 
She's got a whole file of them, man. She's really serious about it.' 
His eyes narrowed immediately, and I had a sinking feeling that the beer had betrayed me 
into saying more than I should have. 
'How come you know so much about my girl?' 
All of a sudden I felt as if I had been dropped into a long field that was full of loaded 
mines. 'It's all she talks about Arnie. Once she gets started on the subject, you can't shut her 
up.' 
'Chummy. You're not moving in, are you, Dennis?' He was watching me closely, his eyes 
slitted with suspicion. 'You wouldn't do anything like that, would you?' 
'No,' I said, lying completely and fully. 'That's a hell of a thing to say.' 
'Then how do you know so much about what she's doing?' 
'I see her around,' I said, 'We talk about you.' 
'She talks about me?' 
'Yeah, a little,' I said casually. 'She said that you and she had a fight over Christine.'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">It was the right thing. He relaxed. 'It was just a little thing. Just a little spat. She'll come 
around. And there are good schools out in California, if she wants to go to school. We're 
going to be married, Dennis. Have kids and all that shit.' 
I struggled to keep my poker face. 'Does she know that?' 
He laughed. 'No way! Not yet. But she will. Soon enough. I love her, and nothing's going to 
get in the way of that.' The laughter died away. 'What did she say about Christine?' 
Another mine. 
'She said she didn't like her. I think . . . that maybe she was a little jealous.' 
It was the right thing again. He relaxed even more. 'Yeah, she sure was. But she'll come 
around, Dennis. The course of true love never runs smooth, but she'll come around, don't 
worry. If you see her again, tell her I'm going to call. Or talk to her when school starts again.' 
I considered telling him that Leigh was in California right now and decided not to. And I 
wondered what this new suspicious Arnie would do if he knew I had kissed the girl he 
thought he was going to marry, had held her . . . was failing in love with her. 
'Look, Dennis!' Arnie cried, and pointed at the TV. 
They had switched to Times Square again. The crowd was a huge - but still swelling - 
organism. It was just past eleven-thirty. The old year was guttering. 
'Look at those shitters!' He cackled his shrill, excited laugh, finished his beer, and went 
downstairs for a fresh six-pack. I sat in my chair and thought about Welch and Repperton, 
Trelawney, Stanton, Vandenberg, Darnell. I thought about how Arnie - or whatever Arnie 
had become - thought that he and Leigh had just had an unimportant lovers' spat and how 
they would end the school year getting married, just like in those greasy love-ballads from the 
Nifty Fifties. 
And oh God I had such a case of the creeps. 
* * * * * 
We saw the New Year in. 
Arnie produced a couple of noisemakers and party favours - the kind that go bang and then 
release a cloud of tiny crepe streamers. We toasted 1979 and talked a little more on neutral 
subjects such as the Phillies' disappointing collapse in the playoffs and the Steelers' chances 
of going all the way to the Super Bowl. 
The bowl of popcorn was down to the old maids and the burny-bottoms when I took myself 
in hand and asked one of the questions I had been avoiding. 'Arnie? What do you think 
happened to Darnell?'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">He glanced at me sharply, then glanced back at the TV, where couples with New Year's 
confetti in their hair were dancing. He drank some more beer. 'The people he was doing 
business with shut him up before he could talk too much. That's what I think happened.' 
'The people he was working for?' 
'Will used to say the Southern Mob was bad,' Arnie said, 'but that the Colombians were 
even worse.' 
'Who are the 
'The Colombians?' Arnie laughed cynically. 'Cocaine cowboys, that's who the Colombians 
are. Will used to claim they'd kill you if you even looked at one of their women the wrong 
way - and sometimes if you looked at her the right way. Maybe it was the Colombians. It was 
messy enough to be them.' 
'Were you running coke for Darnell?' 
He shrugged. 'I was running stuff for Will. I only moved coke for him once or twice, and I 
thank Christ that I didn't have anything worse than untaxed cigarettes when they picked me 
up. They caught me dead-bang. Bad shit. But if the situation was the same, I'd probably do it 
again. Will was a dirty, scuzzy old sonofabitch, but in some ways he was okay.' His eyes 
grew veiled, strange. 'Yeah, in some ways he was okay. But he knew too much. That's why 
he got wasted. He knew too much . . . and sooner or later he would have said something, 
Probably it was the Colombians. Crazy fuckers.' 
'I don't get you. And it's not my business, I suppose.' 
He looked at me, grinned, and winked. 'It was Vietnam,' he said. 'At least, it was supposed 
to be. There was a guy named Henry Buck. He was supposed to rat on me. I was supposed to 
rat on Will. And then - the big casino - Will was supposed to rat on the people down South 
that were selling him the dope and the fireworks and cigarettes and booze. Those were the 
people Ju - the cops really wanted, Especially the Colombians.' 
'And you think they killed him?' 
He looked at me flatly. 'Them or the Southern Mob, sure. Who else?' 
I shook my head. 
'Well,' he said, 'Let's have another beer and then I'll give you a lift home. I enjoyed this, 
Dennis, I really did.' There was a ring of truth in that, but Arnie would never have made a 
dorky comment like 'I enjoyed this, I really did.' Not the old Arnie. 
'Yeah, me too, man.' 
I didn't want another beer, but I took one anyway. I wanted to put off the inevitable moment 
of getting into Christine. This afternoon it had seemed a necessary step to sample the 
atmosphere of that car itself . . . if there was any atmosphere to sample. Now it seemed a</p>
      <p class="calibre3">frightening and crazy idea. I felt the secret of what Leigh and I were becoming to each other 
like a large, breakable egg in my head. 
Tell me, Christine, can you read minds? 
I felt a crazy laugh coming up my throat and dumped beer on it. 
'Listen,' I said. 'I can call my dad to come and get me, if you want, Arnie. He'll still be up.' 
'No problem,' Arnie said. 'I could walk two miles of straight line, don't worry.' 
'I just thought - ' 
'Bet you're anxious to be able to drive yourself around again, huh?' 
'Yeah, I am.' 
'There's nothing finer than being behind the wheel of your own car,' Arnie said, and then his 
left eye slipped down in a bleary old rouй's wink. 'Except maybe pussy.' 
* * * * * 
The time came. Arnie snapped off the TV and I crutched my way across the kitchen and 
worked into my old ski parka, hoping that Michael and Regina would come in from their 
party and delay things a while longer - maybe Michael would smell beer on Arnie's breath 
and offer me a ride. The memory of the afternoon I had slipped behind Christine's wheel, 
when Arnie was in LeBay's house, dickering with the old sonofabitch, was all too clear in my 
mind. 
Arnie had gotten a couple of beers from the fridge - 'for the road', he said. I considered 
telling him that if he got picked up DWI while he was on bail, he'd probably go to jail before 
he could turn around. Then I decided I better keep my mouth shut. We went out. 
The first early morning of 1979 was deeply, clearly cold, the kind of cold that makes the 
moisture in your nose freeze in seconds. The snowbanks ringing the driveway glittered with 
billions of diamond crystals. And there sat Christine, her black windows cauled with frost. I 
stared at her. The Mob, Arnie had said. The Southern Mob or the Colombians. It sounded 
melodramatic but possible - no, more; it sounded plausible. But the Mob shot people, pushed 
them out of windows, strangled them. According to legend, Al Capone had disposed of one 
poor sucker with a lead-cored baseball bat. But to drive a car over some guy's snow covered 
lawn and slam it through the side of his house and into his living room? 
The Colombians, maybe. Arnie said the Colombians are crazy. But that crazy? I didn't 
think so. 
She glittered in the light from the house and the stars, and what if it was her? And what if 
she found out that Leigh and I had our suspicions? Worse yet, what if she found out that we 
had been fooling around?</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'You need help on the steps, Dennis?' Arnie asked, startling me. 
'No, I can handle the steps,' I said. 'You might have to give me a hand on the path.' 
'No problem, man.' 
I got down the kitchen steps sidesaddle, clutching the railing in one hand and my crutches 
in the other. On the path, I set them under me, got out a couple of steps, and then slipped. A 
dull thud of pain rumbled up my left leg, the one that still wasn't worth doodly-squat. Arnie 
grabbed me. 
'Thanks,' I said, glad of a chance to sound shaky. 
'No sweat.' 
We got over to the car, and Arnie asked if I could get in by myself. He left me and crossed 
around the front of Christine's hood. I got hold of the doorhandle with one gloved hand, and a 
hopeless feeling of dread and revulsion swept over me. It wasn't until then that I really began 
to believe it, deep inside, where a person lives. Because that doorhandle felt alive under my 
hand. It felt like some living beast that was asleep. The doorhandle didn't feel like chromed 
steel; dear Christ, it felt like skin. It seemed as if I could squeeze it and wake the beast up, 
roaring. 
Beast? 
Okay, what beast? 
What was it? Some sort of afreet? . An ordinary car that had somehow become the 
dangerous, stinking dwelling-place of a demon? A weird manifestation of LeBay's lingering 
personality, a hellish haunted house that rolled on Goodyear rubber? I didn't know. All I 
knew was that I was scared, terrified. I didn't think I could go through with this. 
'Hey, you okay?' Arnie asked. 'Can you make it?' 
'I can make it,' I said hoarsely, and jammed my thumb down on the button below the 
handle. I opened the door, turned my back on the seat, and let myself fall backward onto it, 
left leg extending stiffly. I got hold of my leg and swung it in. It was like moving a piece of 
furniture. My heart was triphammering in my chest. I pulled the door shut. 
Arnie turned the key and the motor rumbled to life - as if the engine were hot instead of 
dead cold. And the smell assaulted me, seeming to come from everywhere, but most of all 
seeming to pour up from the upholstery: the sick, rotten smell of death and decay. 
I don't know how to tell you about that ride home, that three-mile ride that lasted no more 
than ten or twelve minutes, without sounding like an escapee from a lunatic asylum. There is 
no way to be objective about it; just sitting here and trying is enough to make me feel cold 
and hot at the same time, feverish and ill. There is no way to separate what was real and what 
my mind might have manufactured; no dividing line between objective and subjective,</p>
      <p class="calibre3">between the truth and horrified hallucination. But it wasn't drunkenness; if I can assure you of 
nothing else, I can assure you of that. Any mild high I retained from the beer evaporated 
immediately. What followed was a cold-sober tour of the country of the damned. 
We went back in time, for one thing. 
* * * * * 
For a while Arnie wasn't driving at all; it was LeBay, rotting and stinking of the grave, half 
skeleton and half rotting, spongy flesh, greenly corroded buttons. Maggots squirmed their 
sluggish way up from his collar. I could hear a low buzzing sound and thought at first it was a 
short circuit in one of the dashboard lights. It was only later that I began to think it might 
have been the sound of flies hatching in his flesh. Of course it was wintertime, but - 
At times, there seemed to be other people in the car with us. Once I glanced up into the 
rearview mirror and saw a wax dummy of a woman staring at me with the bright and 
sparkling eyes of a stuffed trophy. Her hair was done in a '50s pageboy style. Her cheeks 
appeared to have been wildly rouged, and I remembered that carbon monoxide poisoning was 
supposed to give the illusion of life and high colour. Later, I glanced into the mirror again 
and seemed to see a little girl back there, her face blackened with strangulation, her eyes 
popping like those of some cruelly squeezed stuffed animal. I shut my eyes tight and when I 
opened them it was Buddy Repperton and Richie Trelawney in the rearview mirror. Crusted 
blood had dried on Buddy's mouth, chin, neck, and shirt. Richie was a roasted hulk - but his 
eyes were alive and aware. 
Slowly Buddy extended his arm. He was holding a bottle of Texas Driver in one blackened 
hand. 
I closed my eyes once more. And after that, I didn't look into the rearview anymore. 
I remember rock and roll on the radio: Dion and the Belmonts, Ernie K-Doe, the Royal 
Teens, Bobby Rydell ('Oh, Bobby, oh . . . everything's cool . . . we're glad you go to a 
swingin school . . .'). 
I remember that for a while red Styrofoam dice seemed to be hanging from the rearview 
mirror, then for a while there were baby shoes, and then there was neither one. 
Most of all I remembering seizing the idea that these things, like the smell of rotting flesh 
and mouldy upholstery, were only in my mind - that they were no more than the mirages that 
haunt the consciousness of an opium-eater. 
I was like someone who is badly stoned and trying to make some kind of rational 
conversation with a straight person. Because Arnie and I did talk; I remember that, but not 
what we talked about. I held up my end. I kept my voice normal. I responded. And that ten or 
twelve minutes seemed to last hours. 
I have told you that it is impossible to be objective about that ride; if there was a logical 
progression of events, it is lost to me now, blocked out. That journey through the cold black</p>
      <p class="calibre3">night really was like a trip on a boulevard through hell. I can't remember everything that 
happened, but I can remember more than I want to. We backed out of the driveway and into a 
mad funhouse world where all the creeps were real. 
* * * * * 
We went back in time, 1 have said, but did we? The present-day streets of Libertyville were 
still there, but they were like a thin overlay of film - it was as if the Libertyville of the late 
1970s had been drawn on Saran Wrap and laid over a time that was somehow more real, and 
I could feel that time reaching its dead hands out toward us, trying to catch us and draw us in 
for ever. Arnie stopped at intersections where we should have had the right-of-way; at others, 
where traffic lights glowed red, he cruised Christine mildly through without even slowing. 
On Main Street I saw Shipstad's Jewellery Store and the Strand Theatre, both of them torn 
down in 1972 to make way for the new Pennsylvania Merchants Bank. The cars parked along 
the street gathered here and there in clumps where New Year's Eve parties were going on - all 
seemed to be pre-60s . . . or pre-1958. Long portholed Buicks. A DeSoto Firelite station 
wagon with a body-long blue inset that looked like a check-mark. A '57 Dodge Lancer four-
door hardtop. Ford Fairlanes with their distinctive tail-lights, each like a big colon lying on its 
side. Pontiacs in which the grille had not yet been split. Ramblers, Packards, a few bullet-
nosed Studebakers, and once, fantastical and new, an Edsel. 
'Yeah, this year is going to be better,' Arnie said. I glanced over at him. He raised his 
beercan to his lips, and before it got there, his face had turned to LeBay's a rotting figure 
from a horror comic. The fingers that held the beer were only bones. I swear to you, they 
were only bones, and the pants lay nearly flat against the seat, as if there was nothing inside 
them except broomsticks. 
Is it?' I said, breathing the car's foul and choking miasma as shallowly as possible and 
trying not to choke. 
'It is,' LeBay said, only now he was Arnie again, and as we paused at a stop sign, I saw a '77 
Camaro go ripping past. 'All I ask is that you stand by me a little, Dennis. Don't let my 
mother drag you into this shit. Things are going to turn out.' He was LeBay again, grinning 
fleshlessly and eternally at the idea of things turning out. I felt my brains beginning to totter. 
Surely I would scream soon. 
I dropped my eyes from that terrible half-face and saw what Leigh had seen: dashboard 
instruments that weren't instruments at all, but luminescent green eyes bulging out at me. 
* * * * * 
At some point the nightmare ended. We pulled up at the kerb in an area of town I didn't 
even recognize, an area I would have sworn I had never seen before. Tract houses stood dark 
everywhere, some of them three-quarters finished, some no more than frames. Halfway down 
the block, lit by Christine's hi-beams, was a sign which read:</p>
      <p class="calibre3">MAPLEWAY ESTATES                                                                                            
LIBERTYVILLE REALTORS SOLE SELLING AGENTS                                                                   
A Good Place to Raise YOUR Family                                                                                           
Think about it! 
'Well, here you go,' Arnie said. 'Can you make it up the  walk yourself, man?' 
I looked doubtfully around at this deserted, snow- covered development and then nodded. 
Better here, on crutches, alone, than in that terrible car. I felt a large plastic smile on my face. 
'Sure. Thanks.' 
'Negative perspiration,' Arnie said. He finished his beer, and LeBay tossed it into the back 
seat. 'Another dead soldier.' 
'Yeah,' I said. 'Happy New Year, Arnie.' I fumbled for the doorhandle and opened it. I 
wondered if I could get out, if my trembling arms would support the crutches. 
LeBay was looking at me, grinning. 'Just stay on my side, Dennis,' he said. 'You know what 
happens to shitters who don't.' 
'Yes,' I whispered. I knew, all right. 
I got my crutches out and heaved myself up onto them, careless of any ice that might be 
underneath. They held me. And once out, the world underwent a swimming, twisting change. 
Lights came on - but of course, they had been there all along. My family had moved into 
Mapleway Estates in June of 1959, the year before I was born. 
We still lived here, but the area had stopped being known as Mapleway Estates by 1963 or 
'64 at the latest. 
Out of the car, I was looking at my own house on my own perfectly normal street - just 
another part of Libertyville, Pa. I looked back at Arnie, half-expecting to see LeBay again, 
taxi-driver from hell with his benighted cargo of the long-dead. 
But it was only Arnie, wearing his high school jacket with his name sewn over the left 
breast, Arnie looking too pale and too alone, Arnie with a can of beer propped against his 
crotch. 
'Good night, man.' 
'Goodnight,' I said. 'Be careful going home. You don't want to get picked up.' 
'I won't,' he said. 'You take care, Dennis.' 
'I will.' 
I shut the door. My horror had changed to a deep and terrible sorrow - it was as if he had 
been buried. Buried alive. I watched Christine pull away from the kerb and head off down the 
street. I watched until she turned the corner and disappeared from sight. Then I started up the</p>
      <p class="calibre3">walk to the house. The walk was clear. My dad had scattered most of a ten-pound bag of 
Halite over it with me in mind. 
I was three-quarters of the way to the door when a greyness seemed to drift over me like 
smoke and I had to stop and put my head down and try to hold onto myself. I could faint out 
here, I thought dimly, and then freeze to death on my own front walk where once Arnie and I 
had played hopscotch and jacks and statue-tag. 
At last, little by little, the greyness started to clear. I felt an arm around my waist. It was 
Dad in his bathrobe and slippers. 
'Dennis, are you okay?' 
Was I okay? I had been driven home by a corpse. 
'Yeah,' I said. 'Got a little dizzy. Let's get in. You'll freeze your butt off.' 
He walked up the steps with me, his arm still circling my waist. I was glad to have it. 
'Is Mom still up?' I asked. 
'No - she saw the New Year in, and then she and Ellie went to bed. Are you drunk, Dennis?' 
'No.' 
'You don't look good,' he said, slamming the door behind us. 
I uttered a crazy little shriek of laughter, and things went grey again . . . but only briefly this 
time. When I came back, he was looking at me with tight concern. 
'What happened over there?' 
'Dad - ' 
'Dennis, you talk to me!' 
'Dad, I can't.' 
'What is it with him? What's wrong with him, Dennis?' 
I only shook my head, and it wasn't just the craziness of it, or fear for myself. Now I was 
afraid for all of them - my dad, my mom, Elaine, Leigh's folks. Coldly and sanely afraid. 
Just stay on my side, Dennis. You know what happens to shitters who don't. 
Had I really heard that? 
Or had it been in my mind only? 
My father was still looking at me. 
'I can't.'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'All right,' he said. 'For now. I guess. But I need to know one thing, Dennis, and I want you 
to tell me. Do you have any reason to believe that Arnie was involved some way with 
Darnell's death, and the deaths of those boys?' 
I thought of LeBay's rotting, grinning face, the flat pants poked up by something that could 
only have been bones. 
'No,' I said, and that was almost the truth. 'Not Arnie.' 
'All right,' he said. 'You want a hand up the stairs?' 
'I can make it okay. You go to bed yourself, Dad.' 
'Yeah. I'm going to. Happy New Year, Dennis - and if you want to tell me, I'm still here.' 
'Nothing to tell,' I said. 
Nothing I could tell. 
'Somehow,' he said, 'I doubt that.' 
* * * * * 
I went up and got into bed and left the light on and didn't sleep at all. It was the longest 
night of my life, and several times I thought of getting up and going in with my mom and 
dad, the way I had done when I was small. Once I actually caught myself getting out of bed 
and groping for my crutches. I lay back down again. I was afraid for all of them, yes, right. 
But that wasn't the worst. Not anymore. 
I was afraid of losing my mind. That was the worst. 
The sun was just poking over the horizon when I finally dropped off and dozed uneasily for 
three or four hours. And when I woke up, my mind had already begun trying to heal itself 
with unreality. My problem was that I could simply no longer afford to listen to that lulling 
song. The line was blurred for good.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">46   GEORGE LEBAY AGAIN 
 
That fateful night the car was stalled

But you went running back . . . 
                             - Mark Dinning 
 
On Friday January 5th I got a postcard from Richard McCandless, secretary of the 
Libertyville American Legion Post. Written on the back in smudgy pencil was George 
LeBay's home address in Paradise Falls, Ohio. I carried the card around in my hip pocket 
most of the day, taking it out occasionally and looking at it. I didn't want to call him; I didn't 
want to talk to him about his crazy brother Roland again; I didn't want this crazy business to 
go any further at all. 
That evening my father and mother went out to the Monroeville Mall with Ellie, who 
wanted to spend some of her Christmas money on a new pair of downhill skis. Half an hour 
after they were gone, I picked up the telephone and propped McCandless's postcard up in 
front of me. A call to Ohio directory assistance placed Paradise Falls in area code 513 - 
western Ohio. After a pause for thought I called directory assistance again and got LeBay's 
number. I jotted it on the card, paused for thought again - a long pause, this time - and then 
picked up the phone a third time. I dialled half of LeBay's number and then hung up. Fuck it, 
I thought, full of a nervous resentment I could not recall ever feeling before. Enough is 
enough, so fuck it, I'm not calling him. I'm done with it, I wash my hands of the whole crappy 
mess. Let him go to hell in his own handcar. Fuck it. 
'Fuck it,' I whispered, and got out of there before my conscience could begin to bore into 
me again. I went upstairs, took a sponge bath, and then turned in. I was soundly asleep before 
Ellie and my folks came back in, and I slept long and well that night. A good thing, because it 
was a long time before I slept that well again. A very long time. 
* * * * * 
While I slept, someone - something - killed Rudolph Junkins of the Pennsylvania State 
Police. It was in the paper when I got up next morning. DARNELL INVESTIGATOR 
MURDERED NEAR BLAIRSVILLE, the headline shouted. 
My father was upstairs taking a shower; Ellie and two of her friends out on the porch, 
giggling and cawing over a game of Monopoly; my mother working on one of her stories in 
the sewing room. I was at the table by myself, stunned and scared. It occurred to me that 
Leigh and her family were going to be back from California tomorrow, school would start</p>
      <p class="calibre3">again the day after, and unless Arnie (or LeBay) changed his mind, she would be actively 
pursued. 
I slowly pushed away the eggs I had scrambled for myself. I no longer wanted them. Last 
night it had seemed possible to push away the whole ominous and inexplicable business of 
Christine as easily as I'd just pushed away my breakfast. Now I wondered how I could have 
been so naive. 
Junkins was the man Arnie had mentioned New Year's Eve. I couldn't even kid myself that 
it hadn't been. The paper said he had been the man in charge of Pennsylvania's part of the 
Will Darnell investigation, and it hinted that some shadowy crime organization had been 
behind the murder. The Southern Mob, Arnie would have said. Or the crazy Colombians. 
I thought differently. 
Junkins's car had been driven off a lonely country road and battered to so much senseless 
wreckage 
(That goddam Junkins is still after me full steam ahead; he better watch out or somebody 
might just junk him. . . . Just stay on my side, Dennis. You know what happens to shitters who 
don't. . . . ) 
with Junkins still inside it. 
When Repperton and his friends were killed, Arnie had been in Philly with the chess club. 
When Darnell was killed, be was in Ligonier with his parents, visiting relatives. Cast-iron 
alibis. I thought he would have another for Junkins. Seven - seven deaths now, and they 
formed a deadly ring around Arnie Cunningham and Christine. The police could surely see 
that; not even a blind man could miss such an explicit chain of motivation. But the paper 
didn't say that anyone was 'aiding the police in their enquiries', as the British so delicately put 
it. 
Of course, the police are not in the habit of just handing everything they know over to the 
newspapers. I knew that, but every instinct I had told me that the state cops weren't seriously 
investigating Arnie in connection with this latest murder by automobile. 
He was in the clear. 
What had Junkins seen behind him on that country road outside of Blairsville? A red and 
white car, I thought. Maybe empty, maybe driven by a corpse. 
A goose ran squawking over my grave and my arms broke in cold bumps. 
Seven people dead. 
It had to end. If for no other reason than because maybe killing gets to be a habit. If 
Michael and Regina wouldn't go along with Arnie's crazy California plans, either of them or 
both of them might be next. Suppose he walked up to Leigh in study hall period three next</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Tuesday and asked her to marry him and Leigh simply said no? What might she see idling at 
the kerb when she got home that afternoon? 
Jesus Christ, I was scared. 
My mother poked her head in. 'Dennis, you're not eating.' 
I looked up. 'I got reading the paper. Guess I'm not that hungry, Mom.' 
'You have to eat right or you're not going to get well. Want me to make you oatmeal?' 
My stomach churned at the thought, but I smiled as I shook my head. 'No - but I'll eat a big 
lunch.' 
'Promise?' 
'Promise.' 
'Denny, do you feel okay? You've looked so tired and peaked lately.' 
'I'm fine, Mom.' I widened my smile to show her how fine I was, and then I thought of her 
getting out of her blue Reliant-K at the Monroeville Mall, and two rows back was a white-
over-red car, idling. In my mind's eye I saw her walk in front of it, purse over her arm, saw 
Christine's transmission lever suddenly drop into DRIVE - 
'Are you sure? It's not your leg bothering you, is it?' 
'No.' 
'Have you taken your vitamins?' 
'Yes.' 
'And your rosehips?' 
I burst out laughing. She looked irritated for a moment, then smiled. 'Ye're a sassbox, 
Dennis Guilder,' she said in her best Irish accent (which is pretty good, since her mom came 
from the auld sod), 'and there's no kivver to ye.' She went back to the sewing room, and in a 
moment the irregular bursts of her typewriter began again. 
I picked up the newspaper and looked at the photo of Junkins's twisted auto. DEATH CAR, 
the caption beneath read. 
Try this, I thought: Junkins is interested in a lot more than finding out who sold illegal 
fireworks and cigarettes to Will Darnell. Junkins is a state detective, and state detectives 
work on more than one case at a time. He could have been trying to find out who killed 
Moochie Welch. Or he could have been - 
I crutched over to the sewing room and knocked. 
'Yes?'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'Sorry to bother you, Mom 
'Don't be silly, Dennis.' 
'Are you going downtown today?' 
'I might be. Why?' 
'I'd like to go to the library.' 
* * * * * 
By three O'clock that Saturday afternoon it had begun to snow again. I had a slight 
headache from staring into the microfilm reader, but I had what I wanted. My hunch had been 
on the money -  not that it had been any great intuitive leap. 
Junkins had been in charge of the hit-and-run that had killed Moochie Welch, all right . . . 
and he had also been in charge of investigating what had happened to Repperton, Trelawney, 
and Bobby Stanton. He'd have to be one dumb cop not to read Arnie's name between the lines 
of what was happening. 
I leaned back in the chair, snapped off the reader, and closed my eyes. I tried to make 
myself be Junkins for a minute. He suspects Arnie of being involved with the murders. Not 
doing them, but involved somehow. Does he suspect Christine? Maybe he does. On the TV 
detective shows, they're always great at identifying guns, typewriters used to write ransom 
notes, and cars involved in hit-and-runs. Flakes and scrapes of paint, maybe. . . . 
Then the Darnell bust looms up. For Junkins, that's nothing but great. The garage will be 
closed and everything in it impounded. Maybe Junkins suspects . . . 
What? 
I worked harder at imagining. I'm a cop. I believe in legitimate answers, sane answers, 
routine answers. So what do I suspect? After a moment, it came. 
An accomplice, of course. I suspect an accomplice. It has to be an accomplice. Nobody in 
his right mind would suspect that the car was doing it herself. So . . . ? 
So after the garage is closed, Junkins brings in the best technicians and lab men he can lay 
his hands on. They go over Christine from stem to stern, looking for evidence of what has 
happened. Reasoning as Junkins would reason trying to, anyway - I think that there has to be 
some evidence. Hitting a human body is not like hitting a feather pillow. Hitting the crash 
barrier out at Squantic Hills is not like hitting a feather pillow, either. 
So what do they find, these experts in vehicular homicide? 
Nothing. 
They find no dents, no touch-up repainting, no blood stains. They find no embedded brown 
paint-flakes from the Squantic Hills road barrier that was broken off. In short, Junkins finds</p>
      <p class="calibre3">absolutely no evidence that Christine was used in either crime. Now jump ahead to Darnell's 
murder. Does Junkins hustle over to the garage the next day to check on Christine? I would, 
if it was me. The side of a house isn't a feather pillow either, and a car that has just crashed 
through one must have sustained major damage, damage that simply couldn't have been 
repaired overnight. And when he gets there, what does he find? 
Only Christine, without so much as a ding in her fender. 
That led to another deduction, one that explained why Junkins had never put a stakeout on 
the car, I hadn't been able to understand that, because he must have suspected that Christine 
was involved. But in the end, logic had ruled him - and perhaps it had killed him, as well. 
Junkins hadn't put a stakeout on her because Christine's alibi, while mute, was every bit as 
iron-clad as those of her owner. If he had inspected Christine immediately following the 
murder of Will Darnell, Junkins must have concluded that the car could not have been 
involved, no matter how persuasive the evidence to the contrary seemed. 
Not a scratch on her. And why not? It was just that Junkins hadn't had all the facts. I 
thought about the milometer that ran backward, and Arnie saying, Just a glitch. I thought of 
the nest of cracks in the windscreen that had seemed to grow smaller and draw inward - as if 
they were running backward too. I thought of the haphazard replacement of parts that seemed 
totally without rhyme or reason. Last of all, I thought of my nightmare ride home on Sunday 
night - old cars that looked new clumped up at the kerb outside houses where parties were 
going on, the Strand Theatre intact again in all of its yellow brick solidity, the half-built 
development that had been completed and occupied by Libertyville suburbanites twenty years 
ago. 
Just a glitch. 
I thought that not knowing about that glitch was what had really killed Rudolph Junkins. 
Because, look: if you own a car long enough, things wear out no matter how well You take 
care of it, and they usually go randomly. A car comes off the assembly line like a newborn 
baby, and just like a newborn, it starts rolling down an Indian gauntlet of years. The slings 
and arrows of outrageous fortune crack a battery here, bust a tie-rod there, freeze a bearing 
somewhere else. The carburettor float sticks, a tyre blows, there's an electrical short, the 
upholstery starts getting ratty. 
It's like a movie. And if you could run the film backward - 
'Will there be anything else, sir?' the Records Clerk asked from behind me, and I nearly 
screamed. 
* * * * * 
Mom was waiting for me in the main lobby, and she chattered most of the way home about 
her writing and her new class, which was disco dancing. I nodded and replied in most of the 
right places. And I thought that if Junkins had brought in his technicians, his high-powered</p>
      <p class="calibre3">auto specialists from Harrisburg, they had probably overlooked an elephant while looking for 
a needle. I couldn't blame them, either. Cars just don't run backward, like a movie in reverse. 
And there are no such things as ghosts or revenants or demons preserved in Quaker State 
motor oil. 
Believe in one, believe in all, I thought, and shuddered. 
'Want to turn up the heater, Denny?' Mom asked brightly. 
'Would you, Mom?' 
I thought of Leigh, who was due back tomorrow. Leigh with her lovely face (enhanced by 
those slanting, almost cruel cheekbones), her young and sweetly luscious figure that had not 
yet been marred by the forces of time or gravity; like that long-ago Plymouth that had rolled 
out of Detroit on a carrier in 1957, she was, in a sense, still under warranty. Then I thought of 
LeBay, who was dead and yet undead, and I thought of his lust (but was it lust? or just a need 
to spoil things?). I thought of Arnie saying with calm assurance that they were going to be 
married. And then, with a helpless clarity, I saw their wedding night. I saw her looking up 
into the darkness of some motel room and seeing a rotting grinning corpse poised over her. I 
heard her screams as Christine, a Christine still festooned with crepe streamers and soaped-on 
JUST MARRIED signs, waited faithfully outside the closed and locked door. Christine - or the 
terrible female force that animated her - would know Leigh wouldn't last long . . . and she, 
Christine, would be around when Leigh was gone. 
I closed my eyes to block the images out, but that only intensified them. 
It had begun with Leigh wanting Arnie and had progressed logically enough to Arnie 
wanting her back. But it hadn't stopped there, had it? Because now LeBay had Arnie. . . and 
he wanted Leigh. 
But he wasn't going to have her. Not if I could help it. That night I called George LeBay. 
'Yes, Mr Guilder,' he said, He sounded older, tireder. 'I remember you very well. I talked 
your ear off in front of my unit in what I believe may have been the most depressing motel in 
the universe. What can I do for you?' He sounded as though he hoped I wouldn't require too 
much. 
I hesitated. Did I tell him that his brother had come back from the dead? That not even the 
grave had been able to end his hate of the shitters? Did I tell him he had possessed my friend, 
had picked him out as unerringly as Arnie had picked out Christine? Did we talk about 
mortality, and time, and rancid love? 
'Mr Guilder? Are you there?' 
'I've got a problem, Mr LeBay. And I don't know exactly how to tell you about it. It 
concerns your brother.'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Something new came into his voice then, something tight and controlled. 'I don't know what 
sort of a problem you could have that would concern him. Rollie's dead.' 
'That's just it.' Now I was unable to control my own voice. It trembled up to a higher octave 
and then drifted back down again. 'I don't think he is.' 
'What are you talking about?' His voice was taut, accusing . . . and fearful. 'If this is your 
idea of a joke, I assure you it's in the poorest possible taste.' 
'No joke. Just let me tell you some of the stuff that's happened since your brother died.' 
'Mr Guilder, I have several sets of papers to correct, and a novel I want to finish, and I 
really don't have time to indulge in - ' 
'Please,' I said. 'Please, Mr LeBay, please help me, and help my friend.' 
There was a long, long pause, and then LeBay sighed. 'Tell your tale,' he said, and then, 
after a brief pause, he added, 'Goddam you.' 
* * * * * 
I passed the story along to him by way of modern long-distance cable; I could imagine my 
voice going through computerized switching stations full of miniaturized circuits, under 
snow-blanketed wheatfields, and finally into the ear of this man. 
I told him about Arnie's trouble with Repperton, Buddy's expulsion and revenge; I told him 
about the death of Moochie Welch; what had happened at Squantic Hills; what had happened 
during the Christmas Eve storm. I told him about windscreen cracks that seemed to run 
backward and a milometer that did for sure. I told him about t e radio that seemed to receive 
only WDIL, the oldies station, no matter where you set it - that brought a soft grunt of 
surprise from George LeBay. I told him about the handwriting on my casts, and how the one 
Arnie had done on Thanksgiving night matched his brother's signature on Christine's original 
registration form. I told him about Arnie's constant use of the word 'shitters'. The way he had 
started combing his hair like Fabian, or one of those other fifties greaseballs. I told him 
everything, in fact, except what had happened to me on my ride home early on New Year's 
morning. I had intended to, but I simply could not do it. I never let that out of myself until I 
wrote all of this down four years later. 
When I finished, there was a silence on the line. 
'Mr LeBay? Are you still there?' 
'I'm here,' he said finally. 'Mr Guilder - Dennis - I don't intend to offend you, but you must 
realize that what you are suggesting goes far beyond any possible psychic phenomena and 
extends into .'He trailed off. 
'Madness?'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'That isn't the word I would have used. From what you say, you were involved in a terrible 
football accident. You were in the hospital for two months, and in great pain for some of that 
time. Now isn't it possible that your imagination - ' 
'Mr LeBay,' I said 'did your brother ever have a saying about the little tramp?' 
'What?' 
'The little tramp. Like when you throw a ball of paper at the wastebasket and hit it, you say 
“Two points.” Only instead of that, “Watch me put it up the little tramp's ass.” Did your 
brother ever say that?' 
'How did you know that?' And then, without giving me time to answer: 'He used the phrase 
on one of the occasions when you met him, didn't he?' 
'No. 
'Mr Guilder, you're a liar.' 
I said nothing. I was shaking, weak-kneed. No adult had ever said that to me in my whole 
life. 
'Dennis, I'm sorry. But my brother is dead. He was an unpleasant, possibly even an evil 
human being, but he is dead and all of these morbid fancies and fantasies 'Who was the little 
tramp?' I managed. 
Silence. 
'Was it Charlie Chaplin?' 
I didn't think he was going to reply at all. Then, at last, heavily, he said, 'Only at second 
hand. He meant Hitler. There was a passing resemblance between Hitler and Chaplin's little 
tramp. Chaplin made a movie called The Great Dictator. You've probably never even seen it. 
It was a common enough name for him during the war years, at any rate. You would be much 
too young to remember. But it means nothing.' 
It was my turn to remain silent. 
'It means nothing!' he shouted. 'Nothing! It's vapours and suggestions, nothing more! You 
must see this!' 
' There are seven people dead over here in western Pennsylvania,' I said. 'That's not just 
vapours. There are the signatures on my casts. They're not vapours, either. I saved them, Mr 
LeBay. Let me send them to you. Look at them and tell me if one of them isn't your brother's 
handwriting.' 
'It could be a knowing or unknowing forgery.' 
'If you believe that, get a handwriting expert. I'll pay for it.'</p>
      <p class="calibre3">You could do that yourself.' 
'Mr LeBay,' I said, 'I don't need any more convincing.' 
'But what do you want from me? To share your fantasy? I won't do that. My brother is dead. 
His car is just a car.' He was lying. I felt it. Even through the telephone I felt it. 
'I want you to explain something you said to me that night we talked.' 
'What would that be?' He sounded wary. 
I licked my lips. 'You said he was obsessed and angry, but he wasn't a monster. At least, 
you said, you didn't, think he was. Then it seemed like you changed the subject completely . . 
. but the more I think about it, the more I think you didn't change the subject at all. The next 
thing you said was that he never put a mark on either of them.' 
'Dennis, really. I - ' 
'Look, if you were going to say something, for Christ's sake, say it now!' I cried. My voice 
cracked. I wiped my forehead, and my hand came away slimy with sweat. 'This is no easier 
for me than it is for you, Arnie's fixated on this girl, her name is Leigh Cabot, only I don't 
think it's Arnie who's fixated on her at all, I think it's your brother, your dead brother, now 
talk to me, please!' 
He sighed. 
'Talk to you?' he said. 'Talk to you? To talk about these old events . . . no, these old 
suspicions . . . that would be almost the same as to shake a sleeping fiend, Dennis. Please, I 
know nothing.' 
I could have told him that the fiend was already awake, but he knew that. 
'Tell me what you suspect.' 
'I'll call you back.' 
'Mr LeBay . . . please . . . ' 
'I'll call you back, ' he said. 'I've got to call my sister Marcia in Colorado.' 
'If it will help, I'll call - ' 
'No, she would never talk to you. We've only talked of it to each other once or twice, if that. 
I hope your conscience is clear on this matter, Dennis. Because you are asking us to rip open 
old scars and make them bleed again. So I'll ask you once more: how sure are you?' 
'Sure,' I whispered. 
'I'll call you back,' he said, and hung up.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Fifteen minutes went past, then twenty. I went around the room on my crutches, unable to 
sit still. I looked out the window at the wintry street, a study in blacks and whites. Twice I 
went to the telephone and didn't pick it up, afraid he would be trying to get me at the same 
time, even more afraid that he wouldn't call back at all. The third time, just as I put my hand 
on it, it rang. I jerked back as if stung, and then scooped it up. 
'Hi?' Ellie's breathless voice said from downstairs. 'Donna?' 
'Is Dennis Guilder - ' LeBay's voice began, sounding older and more broken than ever. 
'I've got it, Ellie,' I said, 
'Well, who cares?' Ellie said pertly, and hung up. 
'Hello, Mr LeBay,' I said. My heart was thudding hard. 
'I spoke to her,' he said heavily. 'She tells me only to use my own judgement. But she is 
frightened. Together, you and I have conspired to frighten an old lady who has never hurt 
anyone and has nothing whatever to do with this.' 
'In a good cause,' I said. 
'Is it?' 
'If I didn't think so, I wouldn't have called you,' I said. 'Are you going to talk to me or not, 
Mr LeBay?' 
'Yes,' he said. 'To you, but to no one else. If you should tell someone else, I would deny it. 
You understand?' 
'Yes.' 
'Very well,' he sighed. 'In our conversation last summer, Dennis, I told you one lie about 
what happened and one lie about what I - what Marcy and I - felt about it. We lied to 
ourselves. If it hadn't been for you, I think we could have continued to lie to ourselves about 
that - that incident by the highway - for the rest of our lives.' 
'The little girl? LeBay's daughter?' I was holding the phone tightly, squeezing it. 
'Yes,' he said heavily. 'Rita.' 
'What really happened when she choked?' 
'My mother used to call Rollie her changeling,' Le Bay said. 'Did I tell you that?' 
'No.' 
'No, of course not. I told you I thought your friend would be happier if he got rid of the car, 
but there is only so much a person can say in defence of one's beliefs, because the irrational . 
. . it creeps in.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">He paused. I didn't prompt him. He would tell, or he wouldn't. It was as simple as that. 
'My mother said he was a perfectly good baby until he was six months old. And then . . . 
she said that was when Puck came, She said Puck took her good baby for one of his jokes and 
replaced him with a changeling. She laughed when she said it. But she never said it when 
Rollie was around to hear, and her eyes never laughed, Dennis. I think . . . it was her only 
explanation for what he was, for why he was so untouchable in his rage . . . so single-minded 
in his few simple purposes. 
'There was a boy - I have forgotten his name - a bigger boy who thrashed Rollie three or 
four times. A bully. He would start on Rollie's clothes and ask him if he'd worn his 
underpants one month or two this time. And Rollie would fight him and curse him and 
threaten him and the bully would laugh at him and hold him off with his longer arms and 
punch him until he was tired or until Rollie's nose was bleeding. And then Rollie would sit 
there on the corner, smoking a cigarette and crying with blood and snot drying on his face. 
And if Drew or I came near him, he would beat us to within an inch of our lives. 
'That bully's house burned down one night, Dennis. The bully and the bully's father and the 
bully's little brother were killed. The bully's sister was horribly burned. It was supposed to 
have been the stove in the kitchen, and maybe it was. But the fire sirens woke me up, and I 
was still awake when Rollie came up the ivy trellis and into the room I shared with him. 
There was soot on his forehead, and he smelled of gasoline. He saw me lying there with my 
eyes open and he said, “If you tell, Georgie, I'll kill you.” And ever since that night, Dennis, 
I've tried to tell myself that he meant if I told he had been out, watching the fire. And maybe 
that was all it was.' 
My mouth was dry. There seemed to be a lead ball in my stomach. The hairs along the nape 
of my neck felt like dry quills. 'How old was your brother then?' I asked hoarsely. 
'Not quite thirteen,' LeBay said with terrible false calm. 'One winter day about a year later, 
there was a fight during a hockey game, and a fellow named Randy Throgmorton laid open 
Rollie's head with his stick. Knocked him senseless. We got him to old Dr Farner - Rollie had 
come around by then, but he was still groggy - and Farner put a dozen stitches in his scalp. A 
week later, Randy Throgmorton fell through the ice on Palmer Pond and was drowned. He 
had been skating in an area clearly marked with THIN ICE signs, apparently.' 
'Are you saying your brother killed these people? Are you leading up to telling me that 
LeBay killed his own daughter?' 
'Not that he killed her, Dennis - never think that. She choked to death. What I am 
suggesting is that he may have let her die.' 
'You said he turned her over - punched her - tried to make her vomit 
'That's what Rollie told me at the funeral,' George said. 
'Then what - '</p>
      <p class="calibre3">'Marcia and I talked it over later. Only that once, you understand. Over dinner that night. 
Rollie told me, “I picked her up by her Buster Browns and tried to whack that sonofabitch out 
of there, Georgie. But it was stuck down fast.” And what Veronica told Marcia was, “Rollie 
picked her up by her shoes and tried to whack whatever was choking her out of there, but it 
was stuck down fast.” They told exactly the same story, in exactly the same words. And do 
you know what that made me think of?' 
'No.' 
'It made me think of Rollie climbing in the bedroom window and whispering to me, “If you 
tell, Georgie, I'll kill you.”' 
'But . . . why? Why would he - ?' 
'Later, Veronica wrote Marcia a letter and hinted that Rollie had made no real effort to save 
their daughter. And that, at the very end, he put her back in the car. So she would be out of 
the sun, he said. But in her letter, Veronica said she thought Rollie wanted her to die in the 
car.' I didn't want to say it, but I had to. 
'Are you suggesting that your brother offered his daughter up as some kind of a human 
sacrifice?' 
There was a long, thinking, dreadful pause. 
'Not in any conscious way, no,' LeBay said. 'Not any more than I am suggesting that he 
consciously murdered her. If you had known my brother, you would know how ridiculous it 
is to suspect him of witchcraft or sorcery or trafficking with demons. He believed in nothing 
beyond his own senses . . . except, I suppose, for his own will. I am suggesting that he might 
have had some . . . some intuition . . . or that he might have been directed to do what he did. 
'My mother said he was a changeling.' 
'And Veronica?' 
'I don't know,' he said. 'The police verdict was suicide, even though there was no note. It 
may well have been. But the poor woman had made some friends in town, and I have often 
wondered if perhaps she had hinted to some of them, as she had to Marcia, that Rita's death 
was not quite as she and Rollie had reported it. I have wondered if Rollie found out. If you 
tell, Georgie, I'll kill you. There's no proof one way or the other, of course. But I've wondered 
why she would do it the way she did - and I've wondered how a woman who didn't know the 
slightest thing about cars would know enough to get the hose and attach it to the exhaust pipe 
and put it in through the window. I try not to wonder about those things. They keep me awake 
at night.' 
I thought about what he had said, and about the things he hadn't said - the things he had left 
between the lines. Intuitive, he had said. So single-minded in his few simple purposes, he had 
said. Suppose Roland LeBay had understood in some way he wouldn't even admit to himself</p>
      <p class="calibre3">that he was investing his Plymouth with some supernatural power? And suppose he had only 
been waiting for the right inheritor to come along . . . and now . . . 
'Does that answer your questions, Dennis?' 
'I think it does,' I said slowly. 
'What are you going to do?' 
'I think you know that.' 
'Destroy the car?' 
'I'm going to try,' I said, and then looked over at my crutches, leaning against the wall. My 
goddam crutches. 
'You may destroy your friend, as well.' 
'I may save him,' I said. 
Quietly, George LeBay said, ' I wonder if that is still possible.'</p>

There was blood and glass all over,                                                                                                    
And there was nobody there but me.

I kissed her. 
Her arms slipped around my neck. One of her cool hands pressed lightly against the back of 
my head. There was no more question for me about what was going on; and when she pulled 
slightly away from me, her eyes half-closed, I could see there was no question for her, either. 
'Dennis,' she murmured, and I kissed her again. Our tongues touched gently. For a moment 
her kiss intensified; I could feel the passion those high cheekbones hinted at. Then she gasped 
a little and drew back. 'That's enough,' she said. 'We'll be arrested for indecent exposure, or 
something.' 
It was January 18th. We were parked in the lot behind the local Kentucky Fried, the 
remains of a pretty decent chicken dinner spread around us. We were in my Duster, and that 
alone was something of an occasion for me - it was my first time behind the wheel since the 
accident. Just that morning, the doctor had removed the huge cast on my left leg and replaced 
it with a brace. His warning to stay off it was stern, but I could tell he was feeling good about 
the way things were going for me. My recovery was about a month ahead of schedule. He put 
it down to superior techniques; my mother to positive thinking and chicken soup; Coach 
Puffer to rosehips. 
Me, I thought Leigh Cabot had a lot to do with it. 
'We have to talk,' she said. 
'No, let's make out some more,' I said. 
'Talk now. Make out later.' 
'Has he started again?' 
She nodded.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">In the almost two weeks since my telephone conversation with LeBay, the first two weeks 
of winter term, Arnie had been working at making a rapprochement with Leigh working at it 
with an intensity that scared both of us. I had told her about my talk with George LeBay (but 
not, as I've said, about my terrible ride home on New Year's morning) and made it as clear as 
I could that on no account should she simply cut him off. That would drive him into a fury, 
and these days, when Arnie was furious with someone, unpleasant things happened to them. 
'That makes it like cheating on him,' she said. 
'I know,' I said, more sharply than I had intended. 'I don't like it, but I don't want that car 
rolling again.' 
'So?' 
And I shook my head, 
In truth, I was starting to feel like Prince Hamlet, delaying and delaying. I knew what had 
to be done, of course; Christine had to be destroyed. Leigh and I had looked into ways of 
doing it. 
The first idea had been Leigh's - Molotov cocktails. We would, she said, fill some wine-
bottles with gasoline, take them to the Cunningham house in the early-morning hours, light 
the wicks ('Wicks? What wicks?' I asked. 'Kotex ought to do just fine,' she answered 
promptly, causing me to wonder again about her high-cheekboned forebears), and toss them 
in through Christine's windows. 
'What if the windows are rolled up and the doors are locked?' I asked her. 'That's the way 
it's apt to be, you know.' 
She looked at me as if I was a total drip. 'Are you saying, she asked, 'that the idea of 
firebombing Arnie's car is okay, but you've got moral scruples about breaking some glass?' 
'No,' I said. 'But who's going to get close enough to her to break the glass with a hammer, 
Leigh? You?' 
She looked at me, biting at her soft lower lip. She said nothing. 
The next idea had been mine. Dynamite. 
Leigh thought about it and shook her head. 
'I could get it without too much sweat, I think,' I said. I still saw Brad Jeffries from time to 
time, and Brad still worked for Penn-DOT, and Penn-DOT had enough dynamite to put Three 
Rivers Stadium on the moon. I thought that maybe I could borrow the right key without Brad 
knowing I had borrowed it - he had a way of getting tanked up when the Penguins were on 
the tube. Borrow the key to the explosives shed during the third period of one game, I 
thought, and return it to his ring in the third period of another. The chance that he would be</p>
      <p class="calibre3">wanting explosives in January, and thus realize his key was missing, was small indeed. It was 
a deception, another betrayal - but it was a way to end things. 
'No,' she said. 
'Why not?' To me, dynamite seemed to offer the kind of utter finality the situation 
demanded. 
'Because Arnie keeps it parked in his driveway now. Do you really want to send shrapnel 
flying all over a suburban neighbourhood? Risking a piece of flying glass cutting off some 
little kid's head?' 
I winced. I hadn't thought of that, but now that she mentioned it, the image seemed sharp 
and clear and hideous. And that got me thinking about other things. Lighting a bundle of 
dynamite with your cigarillo and then tossing it overhand at the object you wanted to destroy 
. . . that might look okay on the Saturday afternoon Westerns they showed on channel 22, but 
in real life there were blasting caps and contact points to deal with. Still, I held onto the idea 
as long as I could. 
'If we did it at night?' 
'Still pretty dangerous,' she said. 'And you know it, too. 
It's all over your face.' 
A long, long pause. 
'What about the crusher at Darnell's? ' she asked finally. 
'Same basic objection as before,' I said. 'Who gets to drive her down there? You, me, or 
Arnie?' 
And that was where matters stood. 
'What was it today?' I asked her. 
'He wanted me to go out with him tonight,' she said. 'Bowling this time.' In previous days it 
had been the movies, out for dinner, over to watch TV at his house, proposed study-dates. 
Christine figured in all of them as the mode of transport. 'He's getting ugly about it, and I'm 
running out of excuses. If we're going to do something, we ought to do it soon.' 
I nodded. Failure to find a satisfactory method was one thing. The other thing holding us 
back had been my leg. Now the cast was off, and although I was on stern doctor's orders to 
use my crutches, I had tested the left leg without them. There was some pain, but not as much 
as I had feared. 
Those things, yeah - but mostly there had been us. Discovering each other. And although 
it's going to sound stinking, r guess I ought to add something else, if this thing is going to stay 
straight (and I promised myself when I began to tell the tale that I'd stop if I found I couldn't</p>
      <p class="calibre3">get it straight or keep it straight). The spice of danger had added something to what I felt for 
her - and, I think, to what she felt for me. He was my best friend, but there was still a dirty, 
senseless attraction in the idea that we were seeing each other behind his back. I felt that each 
time I drew her into my arms, each time my hand slipped over the firm swelling of her 
breasts. The sneaking around. Can you tell me why that should have an attraction? But it did. 
For the first time in my life, I had fallen for a girl. I had slipped before, but this time I had 
taken the grand head-over-heels tumble. And I loved it. I loved her. That constant sense of 
betrayal, though . . . that was a snakelike thing, both a shame and a crazy sort of goad. We 
could tell each other (and we did) that we were keeping our mouths shut to protect our 
families and ourselves. 
That was true. 
But it wasn't all, Leigh, was it? No. It wasn't all.

In one way, nothing worse could have happened. Love slows down reaction time; it mutes 
the sense of danger. My conversation with George LeBay was twelve long days in the past, 
and thinking about the things he had said - and worse, the things he had suggested - no longer 
raised the hair on the back of my neck. 
The same was true - or not true - of the few times I talked with Arnie or glimpsed him in 
the halls. In a strange way, we seemed to be back in September and October again, when we 
had grown apart simply because Arnie was so busy. When we did talk he seemed pleasant 
enough, although the grey eyes behind his specs were cool. I waited for a wailing Regina or a 
distraught Michael to call me on the phone with the news that Arnie had finally stopped 
toying with them and had given up the idea of college in the fall for certain. 
That didn't happen, and it was from Motormouth himself - our guidance counsellor - that I 
heard Arnie had taken home a lot of literature on the University of Pennsylvania, Drew 
University, and Penn State. Those were the schools Leigh was most interested in. I knew it, 
and Arnie knew it - too. 
Two nights earlier, I had happened to overhear my mother and my sister Ellie in the 
kitchen. 
'Why doesn't Arnie ever come over anymore, Mom?' Ellie asked. 'Did he and Dennis have a 
fight?' 
'No, honey,' my mother answered. 'I don't think so. But when friends get older . . . 
sometimes they grow apart.' 
'That's never going to happen to me,' Ellie said, with all the awesome conviction of the just-
turned-fifteen. 
I sat in the other room, wondering if maybe that was really all it was - hallucination brought 
on by my long stay in the hospital, as LeBay had suggested, and a simple growing-apart, a</p>
